        "text": " Last updated on 2 hours ago2 hours ago.From the section Premier Leaguecomments401 Crystal Palace hit four goals in the first 31 minutes as they thrashed sorry West Ham at Selhurst Park. Michael Olise opened the scoring when he rose highest to convert Joachim Andersen's lofted ball into the box.  Eberechi Eze then netted a superb bicycle kick from close range and Emerson Palmieri turned into his own net under pressure from Daniel Munoz for Palace's third of the afternoon. Olise turned provider, squaring the ball across goal for Jean-Philippe Mateta to sidefoot home. Michail Antonio got in behind his man and poked past home goalkeeper Dean Henderson for a Hammers consolation towards the end of the first half. But Oliver Glasner's side continued to dominate after the break and Mateta scored again for his ninth league goal of the campaign in an excellent performance from the Eagles. West Ham pulled another back, making it 5-2, when Tyrick Mitchell fired back towards his own goal without looking and the ball Henderson's scuffed clearance went into the net.  Palace dominated proceedings from start to finish and could have scored even more against a West Ham side who played in Europe on Thursday and looked defeated once they conceded the first goal. Eze's acrobatic goal came after Mateta's effort across Fabianski was saved by his right foot, with the England international firing in the rebound. Eze skewed a few efforts wide of the post after scoring his goal and fired another shot high over the bar from just inside the box as the Hammers struggled to contain the former QPR man. Apart from Antonio's goal, West Ham created few chances of note and were thoroughly outclassed in yet another away performance to forget. It is only the second time Eze and Olise have started together this season and when they do, the improvement in Crystal Palace's performances is clear to see. Both players scored and provided an assist as they danced through the West Ham defence at will. Olise, at 22 years and 131 days old, is the youngest player to have been directly involved in 10 or more goals in each of the past two Premier League campaigns (13 in 2022-23 and 11 in 2023-24). Eze nutmegged the unfortunate Kurt Zouma to set up Mateta for his second goal and will be disappointed he only scored once. Mateta was also in fine form and now has nine goals for the season, more than in his first three campaigns in the competition combined (eight). Olise and Eze were taken off in the 67th and 81st minute respectively, receiving rapturous applause from the home support for their superb performances in Palace's biggest win of the season. West Ham have not fared well after European fixtures this season and they suffered the same fate against Palace, having been knocked out of the Europa League by Bayer Leverkusen on Thursday. After 38 minutes, the home fans were singing \"you're getting sacked in the morning\" to Hammers boss David Moyes. In his 693rd game as a manager in the Premier League, this was the earliest a Moyes side had ever been 4-0 down in a game in the competition and 31 minutes was all it took for Palace to end the game as a contest. Antonio was in the right place to score West Ham's first half goal on his 250th Premier League appearance the club, becoming just the third player to reach this milestone for them in the competition, after Mark Noble (414) and Aaron Cresswell (291). It has been a poor start to the calendar year for the Hammers. They have won just four of their 21 games across all competitions in 2024. West Ham will have to bounce back from defeat quickly as they host title-chasing Liverpool on Saturday (12:30 BST).

        "text": " Last updated on 3 hours ago3 hours ago.From the section Nottm Forest Nottingham Forest say they are \"considering their options\" over \"extremely poor\" refereeing decisions following their 2-0 defeat at Everton. The club said they had \"warned\" the Professional Game Match Officials Board (PGMOL) that \"the VAR is a Luton fan but they didn't change him\". \"Three extremely poor decisions - three penalties not given - which we simply cannot accept,\" the club said on X.external-link \"Our patience has been tested multiple times.\" Although they did not name the official, the video assistant referee was Stuart Attwell.  Nottingham Forest issued the highly critical post on the social network at 15:42 BST, about five minutes after full-time in the match at Goodison Park - which left the club one point above the relegation zone. Questioned about the club's post, Forest boss Nuno Espirito Santo said it was \"not important if he [Attwell] is a fan of another club\".  He added: \"I share the feeling of the club because is it not only this game. It is has been a while that we have had poor decisions going against us. It is not an excuse but we are not happy with the work of the referees.\" BBC Sport is contacting referees' board the PGMOL for comment, and understands the Football Association is aware of the post and investigating. All three penalty claims centred on incidents involving Everton's veteran ex-England defender Young. They felt he caught the back of Gio Reyna's boot in attempting to make a tackle when the game was goalless. Then, late in the first half, after Everton had taken the lead, a Callum Hudson-Odoi cross struck Young on the arm. The third incident happened after the interval, with the Toffees still 1-0 ahead, as Young tangled with Hudson-Odoi in the area but the officials ruled he had won the ball cleanly. \"I don't understand the reason and the decision of [referee] Anthony Taylor and VAR Stuart Attwell, because I see the images,\" Nuno told Sky Sports. \"It is hard to take. There is a penalty on Gio Reyna, it's a kick, don't tell me that is not contact. It's a penalty, then a handball, then the situation of the incident with Callum.  \"So it's understandable that we react like this as a club because we want to get things right. We don't want bad referees. We want good decisions. \"OK if we lost the game today and there were no incidents, we take it.\" In August, Forest lodged a complaint with the PGMOL over the performance of the officials in their 3-2 defeat at Manchester United. While in March, the club's newly appointed referee analyst - and retired referee - Mark Clattenburg criticised the officiating in the build-up to Liverpool's dramatic winner at the City Ground. Forest are still hoping to get some respite from their appeal against the deduction of four points for breaching profit and sustainability rules. BBC Radio 5 Live's football correspondent John Murray said: \"Mark Clattenburg was once considered the best referee we had in this country, he has now got a role with Nottingham Forest - you would think he would be very much involved with this. \"So Nottingham Forest with that statement will be confident with what they are saying, but I still think it is a remarkable thing to say. \"The FA, Howard Webb and the PGMOL - it will certainly ruffle feathers from them. What they have to say about this is the next step.\""

        "text": " Last updated on 3 minutes ago3 minutes ago.From the section Football Arsenal secured the Women's Super League's third and final Champions League place with a comfortable home win over Leicester. In front of 42,820 fans at Emirates Stadium, Jonas Eidevall's side kept up the pressure on Chelsea and Manchester City at the top thanks to goals from Lionesses Beth Mead, who scored twice, and Alessia Russo. Arsenal are six points behind leaders City with nine points to play for - and face Gareth Taylor's side in their penultimate match on 5 May. Mead opened the scoring with a crisp finish, collecting a pass from Caitlin Foord and clipping past Leicester goalkeeper Lize Kop. England team-mate Russo started the game in a number 10 role behind Stina Blackstenius but added the second after moving up front, smashing in low and hard after good play from Steph Catley. And Mead made it three just four minutes later, chipping in from three yards after Kop had denied Russo with an excellent save. Manuela Zinsberger had to make two fine saves to keep out Leicester, with Sam Tierney going closest for the visitors, but Arsenal dominated the second half for an eighth win in nine games. Arsenal were out of the Champions League in the first qualifying stage this season as they fell to a shock defeat by Paris FC but the 2007 winners will hope to fare much better next year. On a day that brought a straightforward victory, the biggest cheer was saved for the second-half return of Frida Maanum, playing for the first time since her collapse during the Continental Cup final win over Chelsea on 31 March. Tests found \"no obvious cardiac causes\" for the midfielder, who has been fitted with a device to monitor her heart, and she played 24 minutes. WSL record goalscorer Vivianne Miedema also made a late return for Arsenal from her latest knee injury. Leicester have now lost all 11 of their away WSL games in London - failing to score in 10 of them - but interim manager Jennifer Foster will be pleased with the way her side stuck in the game for 75 minutes. Despite just four wins all season the Foxes are safe but have plenty of work to do to compete with the best in the top flight.

        "text": " Last updated on 1 hour ago1 hour ago.From the section Premier Leaguecomments470 Liverpool put a frustrating fortnight behind them to reignite their Premier League title bid with a welcome win at Fulham. Trent Alexander-Arnold, making a first league start in more than two months following a knee injury, curled a fabulous first-half free-kick into the top corner to put them ahead. Timothy Castagne steered Fulham level before the break but Ryan Gravenberch's perfectly-measured 20-yard effort flew in off the post to restore the Reds' advantage. Diogo Jota sealed the points with an accurate low finish past Bernd Leno from Cody Gakpo's through ball and the margin of victory could arguably have been greater. Regardless, it was an accomplished and largely trouble-free display from Liverpool that will reassure boss Jurgen Klopp they could yet end his nine-year reign with a second Premier League crown. Dropped points in a draw at Manchester United and a shock Anfield defeat by Crystal Palace - with a disappointing Europa League exit to Atalanta sandwiched in between - had threatened to derail hopes of further trophies to add to the Carabao Cup they have already collected this season. But victory at Craven Cottage lifts Liverpool back up to second in the table, level on points with leaders Arsenal - but behind the Gunners on goal difference - and a point above third-placed Manchester City, who have a game in hand. Klopp's trademark post-match fist-pumping celebration with the travelling supporters seemed to have even more oomph than usual after his side navigated a tricky test they simply could not afford to fail. Fulham have claimed a string of notable scalps at the Cottage this season, upsetting Arsenal there in December, while European hopefuls Tottenham, Brighton and West Ham have all been soundly beaten too. Liverpool were fully aware of their credentials, having been taken to the limit by Marco Silva's side in a thrilling 4-3 win earlier this season as well as edging their Carabao Cup semi-final over two legs. This was far more routine than those prior meetings but it needed Alexander-Arnold - who hit Liverpool's dramatic late winner to down Fulham at Anfield in December - to light the touch paper. He had already whipped in a fine cross for Luis Diaz to glance a header wide before netting his sixth direct free-kick Premier League for Liverpool with an unstoppable strike that left Leno grasping at thin air. Gakpo would have located the very same top corner soon after if not for Leno's fingertips but Fulham's best spell of the game resulted in them drawing level in first-half stoppage time. Not long after Andreas Pereira's attempt to emulate Alexander-Arnold's set-piece magic skimmed the bar, Castagne guided a loose ball in the box into the bottom corner for his first goal since joining Fulham from Leicester last summer. But the hosts were profligate in possession after the break and Liverpool punished them, first with Gravenberch's exquisite curler and then Jota's composure to wrap up the points. Fulham, safely ensconced in 12th place in the table, had little by way of response as Liverpool eased off the gas in the closing stages, perhaps with Wednesday night's Merseyside derby at Everton in mind.

        "text": " Last updated on 20 April 202420 April 2024.From the section Championshipcomments219 Huddersfield Town's hopes of avoiding relegation from the Championship were dealt a heavy blow as they were thrashed at home by Swansea City. Swansea, already safe and with little to play for, had the better of a goalless first half as Jay Fulton and Liam Cullen wasted good chances. Cullen hit the post after the break with a curling effort from the edge of the penalty area, before substitute Jamal Lowe cut in from the left and found the bottom corner with a firm right-footed shot. Huddersfield substitute Danny Ward struck the post as the home side tried to salvage a point, but Ronald made sure of victory for the Swans as he finished off an incisive counter-attack. Swansea scored twice in added time to deepen their opponents' misery, with Jerry Yates converting from close range before fellow substitute Liam Walsh found the top corner with a beautiful strike. Huddersfield remain in the bottom three, but the extent of the damage this result will have on their bid for safety will not be known until later on Saturday. Relegation rivals Queens Park Rangers host Preston North End in the day's late kick-off while another team towards the bottom, Birmingham City, were involved in a game at Rotherham United which was running behind schedule after it was temporarily suspended for a medical emergency in the crowd. Whatever the outcome of those matches, the boos at the final whistle in Yorkshire were a stark illustration of Huddersfield's plight. Whereas the Terriers came into this game in desperate need of points, Swansea had already effectively secured their place in the Championship next season with victory over already-relegated Rotherham a week earlier. Even if there was little riding on this game for Luke Williams' men, they started positively as Brazilian winger Ronald impressed with some dangerous runs forward on the right. One such burst led to a chance for Fulton, whose low shot was well saved by Lee Nicholls.  The best opportunity of the first half fell to Cullen. Josh Tymon's cross from the left was perfect but, despite being completely unmarked just a few yards out from goal, Cullen miscued his header wide. With Huddersfield unable to create much beyond a long-range shot dragged wide by Josh Koroma, the home crowd became increasingly agitated. Their worries increased when Cullen's shot hit the post, before Lowe's opening goal gave the beleaguered Terriers faithful a familiar sinking feeling. Ward's low shot which cannoned off the post gave them hope, but that was soon dashed by a clinical second Swansea goal. Keeper Carl Rushworth launched the ball forward to Tymon, who broke into the box and played a low pass across to Ronald, who finished into an empty net. The damage was already done when Yates hit Swansea's third in injury time, and then Walsh curled in a superb fourth to round off a dismal afternoon for Huddersfield. Huddersfield head coach Andre Breitenreiter told BBC Radio Leeds: \"We are all disappointed and I admit the performance was not good enough today. \"The first half was very disappointing because we knew about the possession game of Swansea but we did not play with our plan. \"We tried to make it better in the second half and created two or three big chances\u2026 but you have to score and we didn't. \"It was too easy how we conceded the goals. I'm disappointed but I also spoke to the team. We have two more games. It's hard to believe after this result today but there are six more points to get.\" Swansea head coach Luke Williams told BBC Radio Wales: \"I'm thrilled with the way the team played. They [Huddersfield] are a far better team than they were earlier in the season but now they have pressure and they gave us a tough game. \"That's why I'm so happy because it wasn't a walk in the park, far from it. The players had to apply themselves. \"We were knocking on the door. We defended incredibly well. People put their bodies on the line and we came away without the opposition hitting the target. \"We have a duty to the competition to play properly. We have a lot to play for. We have fans to play for, then we have professional pride.\" Formation  4-2-3-1 Formation  4-2-3-1 Match ends, Huddersfield Town 0, Swansea City 4.

        "text": " Last updated on 3 hours ago3 hours ago.From the section Women's Footballcomments36 Manchester City moved top of the Women's Super League as they cruised past West Ham to win their 13th league game in a row. City enjoyed a dream start as they surged into a two-goal lead after just three minutes, with Leila Ouahabi turning a Jess Park cut-back past Mackenzie Arnold, before Khadija Shaw fired in on the half-volley after chesting down a Lauren Hemp delivery. The Jamaican striker headed home her second from Hemp cross in the 24th minute but her impressive first half was soured when she had to be substituted at the break. Shaw spent the second half sitting on the bench wearing a protective boot. January signing Laura Blindkilde Brown scored her first goal for City when she turned home a loose ball with nine minutes left before Park scored from the edge of the box to round off a dominant performance. Victory means City sit three points ahead of Chelsea having played a game more and will likely remain at the top until their rivals - who have had two games rearranged due to their Champions League participation - complete their games in hand.  Their early lead gave City the freedom to play creative football in the final third and they were relentless in trying cut through the West Ham defence. Such was the space they were given that Shaw attempted backheels in the West Ham box, Hemp produced a Cruyff turn and others tried efforts from distance. Park, who was instrumental in the build-up to the first goal and was rewarded with her side's fifth, excelled with the freedom she was given as she charged at defenders and carved out openings with her talented dribbling. On the other wing, Hemp grasped the chance to run through the West Ham defence as City's passing play stretched their back line. City sustained their pressure as they enjoyed most of the possession and searched for more goals to aid them in their quest to beat Chelsea's goal difference at the top of the table. If both City and Chelsea win their remaining games then the title race will come down to goal difference - and City's is now three better, albeit having played an extra match. City's continual attacking gave West Ham chances to try and dent the scoreline - with Riko Ueki and Viviane Asseyi both hitting the woodwork - but mounting a comeback was always unlikely. Victory for West Ham would have secured top-flight safety, but it is still likely only a matter of time until they mathematically avoid the drop as they are seven points ahead of bottom club Bristol City.

        "text": " Last updated on 20 April 202420 April 2024.From the section Women's Football Barcelona are confident they can \"turn it around\" in the second leg of their Women's Champions League semi-final against Chelsea, says defender Irene Paredes. The holders are 1-0 down on aggregate after Erin Cuthbert's goal gave Chelsea victory in Spain and inflicted Barca's first loss at home since February 2019. The sides meet again at Stamford Bridge on Saturday, 27 April. \"It's true that we're not used to being behind,\" said Paredes.  \"The team is capable; we're mentally strong and we're hurt by losing the match but at the same time, we're calm because we know we can turn it around\". Barcelona have been formidable in recent years and beat Chelsea in last season's semi-finals before going on to win the competition. Paredes, who was also part of Spain's 2023 World Cup-winning squad, said the second leg at Stamford Bridge will be the \"most decisive\" match of her career. She said: \"There are things to improve, but we have a week to prepare, and we're going there to win\". \"In the end, it's either you move forward or you're out. But this team is used to putting everything on the line in one match.\" Emma Hayes said \"nobody should get carried away\" despite Chelsea's victory at Estadi Olimpic Lluis Companys. \"It's just half-time,\" the Blues manager said. \"To be honest I'm disappointed we didn't get the second goal so I'm a little frustrated.\" Cuthbert struck five minutes before half-time as Chelsea effectively stifled the European champions in front of 36,428 fans in Catalonia. Chelsea's five-player defence ensured Barcelona did not have a shot on target until second-half injury time. But Hayes is wary of a side who have won two Women's Champions League titles and thumped Chelsea 4-0 in the 2021 final. \"Barcelona have another level in them and I think that's clear,\" she told DAZN. \"Maybe they don't feel they were at their best today and we have to anticipate that.\" Chelsea drew 1-1 at Barcelona in the first leg of the semi-final last season - only for Caroline Graham Hansen's fourth-minute goal to win the tie for the Spaniards in the second match in London. \"Barcelona are champions and they will be angry,\" Hayes said. \"They will come to Stamford Bridge knowing they completely outperformed us this time last year in our stadium. We're in exactly the same position as yesterday, we're just at the half-way point and 1-0 up. That's it.\""

        "text": " Last updated on 4 hours ago4 hours ago.From the section Premier Leaguecomments1428 Everton took an important step towards Premier League survival with victory over fellow strugglers Nottingham Forest in a controversial affair at Goodison Park. Idrissa Gueye and Dwight McNeil scored with long-range efforts in each half to settle the battle between the two clubs who have suffered Premier League points deductions this season - with appeals pending that could still shape their fate as the campaign reaches its climax. Everton have now moved five points clear of the relegation zone with a game in hand on Luton Town but Forest remain deep in trouble, only a point ahead of the Hatters. Forest, however, were left fuming by referee Anthony Taylor ignoring three penalty appeals, including when Ashley Young handled in the closing moments of the opening half and then when the veteran tangled with Callum Hudson-Odoi as he raced in on goal in the second period. After the match, Forest sent out a strongly-worded post on social media platform X, criticising \"three extremely poor decisions\" and the appointment of Stuart Attwell as video assistant referee for the game. BBC Sport is contacting the Professional Game Match Officials Limited, the English professional referees' body, for a response. Everton broke the deadlock after 29 minutes when Gueye fired low past Matz Sels, only his second goal in a century of attempts from outside the area, with McNeil settling the destiny of the points when he drilled home via the post from 25 yards with 14 minutes left. There were worrying scenes in stoppage time when Everton striker Beto went down after an aerial challenge with Morgan Gibbs-White.  He lay motionless and the game was stopped for eight minutes while he received treatment before he was taken away on a stretcher. He did, however, appear to gesture to the Everton supporters as he was leaving the pitch. Everton needed an instant response after the humiliation of Monday's 6-0 loss at Chelsea and while, apart from the two goals, it was not a performance to earn points for artistic merit, it earned points of a far more significant kind as the Toffees once again find themselves embroiled in a fight against relegation. They were thankful for an outstanding save by England keeper Jordan Pickford from Forest striker Chris Wood with the score 1-0 and those controversial moments when Young escaped conceding penalties. Everton, however, showed the battling qualities that were absent at Stamford Bridge, took the chances they had and cashed in on the moments of good fortune afforded to them. It was not a game of any serious quality, which was hardly to be expected between two struggling teams in a tense situation, but this is immaterial at this stage of the season. Jarrad Branthwaite demonstrated once again why he is so highly regarded as Everton kept Forest at bay, enabling Sean Dyche's side to make a winning start to a week that could yet define their season, with a Merseyside derby to come against Liverpool at Goodison Park on Wednesday and another home game against Brentford next Saturday evening. Nottingham Forest will feel deeply aggrieved about decisions that went against them at crucial stages of a tight game, but the bottom line is that they are now even deeper in the relegation fight after a defeat that allowed Everton to move four points clear of Nuno Espirito Santo's side. Forest had neat possession on occasions and Wood will feel he should have drawn Forest level, with Gibbs-White also sending a finish carelessly wide when he should have equalised in the second half. In the end, they were undone by those strikes from Gueye and McNeil to leave Forest and manager Nuno looking anxiously ahead to their closing games while still hoping to get some respite from their appeal against the deduction of four points for breaching profit and sustainability rules. Forest face reigning Premier League champions Manchester City next at the City Ground and will need to find more cutting edge from somewhere to ensure their battle to stay in the top flight is successful.

        "text": " Last updated on 20 April 202420 April 2024.From the section Football Cole Palmer has been Chelsea's standout performer this season - can he lift them again to sink former club Manchester City in Saturday's FA Cup semi-final? \"Pep Guardiola and City have not made many errors in the transfer market, but there's one,\" said BBC Sport's football expert Chris Sutton. \"It's not just his goals, it's the way he moves and takes the ball and makes things happen. Chelsea's plan a lot of the time is basically 'get the ball to Palmer'. When it goes to him, you think 'here we go', and it will be the same at Wembley. \"Whatever happens in this game, I think Pep will regret selling him last summer. \"He may not have thought Palmer was going to develop like he has done, but he is one hell of a player and I am sure he would have benefited City this season - including moments like Wednesday, when they needed a game-changer against Real Madrid.\" As well as the FA Cup, Sutton is making predictions for every Premier League game this season against a variety of guests. For all of this weekend's games in both competitions, he takes on singer-songwriter and Arsenal fan Sam Tompkins. Tompkins new single Numb was released this week. His debut album Hi My Name Is Insecure is out on 24 May. Sam grew up in Eastbourne but is a lifelong Arsenal fan. \"I can't really put my finger on the moment I started supporting them, because it's more that it was always around me,\" he told BBC Sport. \"My grandad and my uncle on my mum's side were huge Arsenal fans and one of my earliest memories is of being sat on my grandad's knee, watching a game. \"That is how it started, then my first season of watching football fully as a human being on this planet was the Invincibles season, and my first hero on earth was Thierry Henry. \"So, you can imagine how much that locked me in - but under false pretences of what was to come for Arsenal! \"It was impossible to live up to that, and it gave me such an unrealistic idea of what the Premier League is like - but I would not trade my fan journey with anyone. \"I have seen us go through so many bad times, so to see us doing this well again is amazing, especially with Bukayo Saka, who has come through the academy to become our star player, at the centre of it all too. That is important, and refreshing. \"At the start of this year I actually got to present Martin Odegaard with his player of the month award, which was nuts because they hadn't told me I was doing it. They just surprised me as I was getting in the lift down to pitchside to do an interview. \"Also, I had a recent tragedy in my family and I got a letter signed from Mikel Arteta himself, which was a super nice touch, and meant an awful lot.  \"So, I really feel like after all these years, I support the right club.\" Sam is enjoying watching the Gunners challenging for the top honours again after a few lean years, and feels there is more to come from Arteta's side, whether they win the Premier League this season or not. \"When I look back at the Invincibles side, I loved so many of the players but there is something about our team now where I feel, if I was a kid now, it would give me the same feeling,\" he explained. \"The biggest thing I love about us now is our drive. There was that moment a few games ago where we were 3-0 up against Brighton and Gabriel blocked a shot in stoppage time, then the whole team celebrated with him like he had scored. \"That's the kind of elite mentality we have not had for years, and it is what you need to win things. \"We are a young team too. Declan Rice has transformed us in the middle of the park and the way the ball is fed through. He makes you feel so confident as a fan, and he is going to be so important for us for the next few years. \"And I have such a soft spot in my heart for Ben White, who has been fantastic for us, especially in this calendar year. \"I performed at Ben's wedding last summer and since then we've become quite good mates, so to see him playing so well is amazing.\" Chris Sutton and Sam Tompkins were speaking to BBC Sport's Chris Bevan. Gap = league places separating the two teams. There are no replays. AET = After extra-time. A correct result (picking a win, draw or defeat) is worth 10 points. The exact score earns 40 points. I am at this game for 5 Live, and it will be my first time at Kenilworth Road all season. There is an argument that had you had offered Luton this situation before the campaign started, and told them that with five games to go, they would have a chance of staying up, then they would have taken it. However, I cannot help thinking there have been a few missed opportunities for the Hatters in recent weeks, and they should be in a much stronger position. This is a huge game for Luton because it is a chance for them to climb out of the bottom three and also drag Brentford back into the relegation fight, or at least make life uncomfortable for them. The Bees are not safe yet but after beating Sheffield United last week, they probably only need one more win. I don't see them getting it here, though. Both teams have got a goal in them, but also I don't see either of them keeping a clean sheet. Sutton's prediction: 1-1 Sam's prediction: They will both throw the kitchen sink at each other, but it will end up in a draw. 2-2 To enjoy Newsround at its best you will need to have JavaScript turned on. Both of these teams have had a very similar habit in recent weeks of shooting themselves in the foot. I felt for Clarets boss Vincent Kompany after Arijanet Muric's latest mistake gifted Brighton an equaliser last week. Kompany took James Trafford out of the team because of his form, or lack of it, but whoever he picks in goal, they keep costing Burnley points. I actually think Burnley will get the job done this time, though. They beat Sheffield United 5-0 at Turf Moor earlier in the season and I am expecting them to come out on top again. The Blades will give everything but Burnley will have a bit too much quality for them, and I'm afraid that's been the story of Sheffield United's season. Sutton's prediction: 1-2 Sam's prediction: This is probably Sheffield United's biggest game of the season. I don't think they are getting out of the bottom three, but a win here would give them a bit of confidence. 1-0 To enjoy Newsround at its best you will need to have JavaScript turned on. Watch live on BBC One and the BBC website from 16:45. Live commentary on Radio 5 Live. Manchester City did not deserve to go out of the Champions League on Wednesday. On the balance of play against Real Madrid, they can count themselves a bit unlucky to lose the tie. It is important that they bounce back quickly, though, starting here. City's main focus now will be their attempt to become the first side in the 136-year history of English league football to be crowned champions four times in a row. That would be a huge achievement, and going out of Europe will aid that. Pep is greedy for trophies, though, and of course he will want to lift the FA Cup again too. Chelsea have drawn with City twice this season and they will be dangerous with Palmer in their team. But the kerfuffle over who would take their penalty against Everton on Monday, when Noni Madueke and Nicolas Jackson argued before Palmer took the ball and scored his fourth goal, sums up the whole situation at the club. I would not mind seeing that happen if Palmer had missed a few penalties on the trot, because then it is someone else's turn.  But it appears that they have an odd dressing room at the moment, with a lot of inflated egos in there, and if Chelsea manager Mauricio Pochettino cannot create harmony, you wonder who will. On the pitch, Chelsea have shown a bit more consistency in the second half of the season with an eight-game unbeaten run in the league that has put them in the race for sixth place. Pochettino will want a trophy to underline their improvement, but I think it will be City who progress. I am backing the holders to flex their muscles again, go again... and win this tie quite comfortably. Sutton's prediction: 3-0 Sam's prediction: It's going to be tighter than people might think because a win like the one Chelsea got the other day really puts you in your stride - plus Palmer is playing so well. 2-1 after extra time To enjoy Newsround at its best you will need to have JavaScript turned on. This is a massive game for Arsenal but it definitely helps them that Wolves are on a pretty terrible run, without a win in four games. The talk this week about the Gunners has been whether the wheels are coming off, but I don't think that's the case. They maybe lacked a bit of composure in their defeat by Aston Villa. But Villa have got some very good players, as do Bayern Munich, who beat them in Germany on Wednesday. I'd put Arsenal's Champions League defeat down to their failure to win the first leg at Emirates Stadium, and it would have been a different story if Bukayo Saka hadn't dived when he was through on goal late on in that game. I'm still probably basing this prediction more on Wolves' form than on Arsenal's but I do think the Gunners will find a way to win at Molineux. I hope they do too, because I don't want Manchester City to have it all their own way in the run-in. Sutton's prediction: 0-1 Sam's prediction: This is a make or break game for us and I think the players will respond to that. 0-3 Sam on the title race: I honestly think it is still wide open. I don't believe Liverpool will win it, it's between us and City. They have got the easier run-in but there are still games where I can see them having trouble.

This game could be dubbed 'the deduction derby' and it's hard to know what to expect from either team. I had Everton down to get a draw at Chelsea last time out, so I was only six goals out. The questions here are whether Sean Dyche's side are going to respond to that heavy defeat, and also whether Toffees striker Dominic Calvert-Lewin is going to be fit? Without him, Everton do lack a bit of bite. Beto missed a chance from three yards out on Monday that reminded me of me, in the days when I played for Chelsea and was even missing when I was stood inside the goal. Nottingham Forest are hardly in great form either, with one win in nine games, so the safest thing here would be to go for a draw. I am not going to do that, though. It's a big game at the bottom and I think there will be a winner... and I am going for Everton to sneak it, on the basis that they will show some anger after losing 6-0. Sutton's prediction: 2-1 Sam's prediction: This weekend is like one big relegation scrap. There is something about Forest that makes me think they will win this - Morgan Gibbs-White is playing well. 1-3 To enjoy Newsround at its best you will need to have JavaScript turned on.

Aston Villa's battle with Tottenham for fourth place is one to keep an eye on and Unai Emery's side could take another big step towards Champions League qualification here. Bournemouth drew 2-2 with Villa earlier in the season and I am expecting another close game this time but, after what they did to Arsenal last week, I cannot back against Villa. Confidence must be through the roof for Unai Emery's side, and they have home advantage too. Bournemouth are a good team who have proved me wrong this season, but Villa will create enough chances to win. Sutton's prediction: 2-1 Sam's prediction: Dominic Solanke is class for Bournemouth - what a striker he is - but Villa are winning this and I can see them getting a top-four finish too. 3-0 To enjoy Newsround at its best you will need to have JavaScript turned on.

It is going to take until next season for Eagles boss Oliver Glasner to really make his mark, but a result like that is a good start. I don't think it is a huge coincidence that the Eagles put in that performance when they had Eberechi Eze and Michael Olise in the team together. They carry much more of a threat with both of them fit, and it changes my whole way of thinking when I am predicting Palace games. Palace have a classy player in midfield too in Adam Wharton - I saw enough of him at my old club Blackburn to be impressed and I love the way he knits things together so effortlessly.  Wharton is not the fastest but the first three yards are in his head and he just sees things quicker than most people. He can still improve some aspects of his game but he has only just turned 20 and looks like a shrewd piece of business by the Eagles. As for West Ham, well they have got an uphill struggle to stay in the Europa League on Thursday, and they have got a fight on their hands to qualify for Europe again next season. There is the danger the Hammers' season could fizzle out, although I don't think it will.  Sutton's prediction: 2-1 Sam's prediction: I've got to back Palace here. My girlfriend's mum is a huge Palace supporter and if I don't say they will win, I will never be allowed back in the family home. They have also just beaten Liverpool so their morale should quite high. 2-1 To enjoy Newsround at its best you will need to have JavaScript turned on. Live commentary on Radio 5 Live. Coventry are not in the greatest form in the Championship, with three defeats in their past four games, but I am a romantic at heart and I believe in fairytales too. It is written in the stars that Sky Blues boss Mark Robins wins this tie, against his former club. My old Norwich team-mate famously scored an FA Cup third-round winner for Manchester United in 1990 that saved Sir Alex Ferguson's job, but now I think he will push Erik ten Hag closer to the exit door. Some United fans get very angry on social media whenever I predict they will lose, like last week when I thought Bournemouth would beat them. But, while I did not get the result right on that occasion, another weak United performance in their 2-2 draw validated everything I said about them. United should be beating Coventry comfortably but they have lacked consistency all season and I don't have faith in them to suddenly find it now. So, let me dream a little here. I've got great memories of the 1987 final, when Keith Houchen's diving header helped Coventry upset Tottenham and lift the FA Cup, and what a day it would be for them if they win. Sutton's prediction: 2-1 Sam's prediction: I would love to see Coventry in the final but I have got a United fan right next to me as I make this prediction, so I should probably be nice... he's telling me to say 6-0 and that's not going to happen, but I do think they will win. 1-3 To enjoy Newsround at its best you will need to have JavaScript turned on. Live commentary of first half on Radio 5 Sports Extra and second half on Radio 5 Live. All three games between these teams this season have been close, and I am expecting more of the same on Sunday. Liverpool won a thriller 4-3 at Anfield in the league, followed by a 2-1 home win in the first leg of their Carabao Cup semi-final. I was at Craven Cottage for the second leg, which ended up a 1-1 draw. This is a must-win for Jurgen Klopp's side to keep their title hopes alive, because their season has started to unravel. We will have to wait and see whether Liverpool can turn their Europa League tie around with Atalanta on Thursday, or if Klopp picks a team to even try to rescue their 3-0 deficit. What happens there will tell us a lot about where Liverpool are at, but if they show any weaknesses at the weekend, Fulham are good enough to punish them. Sutton's prediction: 1-1 Sam's prediction: This is my rogue prediction of the weekend. I'm maybe a bit biased because I want Liverpool to drop more points so we can say 'see you later, your title hopes are over' but Fulham are a good team. They have taken five points off us this season so they can do some damage here too. 1-1 To enjoy Newsround at its best you will need to have JavaScript turned on. Sutton got four correct results, including two exact scores from the 10 games in week 33, giving him 100 points. He beat Franklin star Daniel Mays, who got six correct results, but with only one exact score, for a total of 90 points. Crystal Palace's win at Anfield and Aston Villa's victory at Emirates Stadium caught Chris and Daniel out, and most of you too - only 8% of you went for a Palace success and just 11% backed Villa. Your vote for the outcome of Newcastle versus Tottenham was a lot closer, but ultimately you got that wrong too. While 34% of you correctly went for a Magpies win, 35% of you thought Spurs would take the three points. *Win, draw, loss prediction based on highest % of vote for each match."

        "text": " Last updated on 2 hours ago2 hours ago.From the section Women's Footballcomments1 Manchester City could hardly have dreamed of such an impressive start against West Ham. After a mere 174 seconds, they were already two goals ahead and embarking on a statement game in their push for the Women's Super League title. It was a controlling, determined beginning which showed \"why Man City are top of the league,\" according to former England goalkeeper Rachel Brown-Finnis. They added three more goals to their tally and flourished as the early cushion gave them the chance to play at their creative best, with freedom. Beating West Ham meant City returned to the summit of the table and are three points above Chelsea having played a game more. City's display prompted former England midfielder Fara Williams to say she has been left \"lost for words\" by their performances. They have notched up 13 successive wins in the league in their push for a first league title since 2016. City boss Gareth Taylor said the victory is \"a big one\". \"It's a good scoreline for us,\" he told BBC Sport. \"They hit the woodwork on a couple of occasions but overall I'm really pleased with the performance. I thought we started the game tremendously well.  \"It gave us a good platform to speak at half-time about what we wanted to achieve in the second half. To score two towards the end there was important for us.\" The visitors had a handful of chances but the early cushion meant there was little chance of them finding a way back. Riko Ueki and Viviane Asseyi both hit the woodwork, but nobody found a way past Khiara Keating as City strolled to victory. \"Not even in jest, West Ham have been completely outplayed, they don't seem to have any answers,\" said Brown-Finnis. City had 68% possession and had 18 shots, regularly testing Mackenzie Arnold. While they once again opted against starting both Lauren Hemp and Chloe Kelly and therefore lacked their usual partnership on the wings, it made little difference as City adapted and were fluid in the final third. Jess Park, 22, has been handed a run of starts as a result of regular strong performances and showed her prowess once again. Her runs towards the West Ham defence, having the vision to spot when there were gaps to exploit, proved difficult for the visitors to handle. By scoring City's fifth she netted her fourth league goal of the campaign, showing that she has adding the much-needed final product to her game now, too. Managing 18 shots was an excellent tally against a West Ham side who sat back, but it is the fact that 13 of those hit the target which was crucial. \"Two shots, two goals, clinical. That is why Man City are top of the league,\" said Brown-Finnis at 2-0.  It was a form they maintained in the final third throughout the game. They emerged from the break leading 3-0 and struggled to extend their advantage but remained determined to break down West Ham. City continued to press in the final third and two more late goals could make all the difference as they look to beat Chelsea to the title . Should both teams win their remaining games, they will finish the season level and it will come down to goal difference and City now have a three-goal advantage. For now, though, City are top of the league and will likely remain there until 15 May, when Chelsea will have played their rearranged fixtures."

        "text": " Last updated on 20 April 202420 April 2024.From the section Women's Football It is only \"half-time\" of Chelsea's Women's Champions League semi-final tie with Barcelona but they may have just produced the greatest performance of manager Emma Hayes' tenure.  They inflicted Barcelona's first defeat at home since February 2019 as Erin Cuthbert fired home the only goal on the stroke of half-time against the defending European champions.  Celebrations were subdued at full-time as Hayes applauded her side's efforts and led them over to the away fans in the stands, while Barcelona supporters chanted \"yes, we can\" in encouragement, their thoughts immediately turning to the second leg. Hayes was also forward-thinking as she played down the magnitude of the result, saying a reaction from Barcelona would come in London, while appearing largely unsatisfied with a narrow 1-0 lead.  It speaks to the pedigree of their opponents that such a result is met with caution - Barcelona are widely considered the best team in women's club football and they have caused plenty of heartache for Chelsea before.  Memories of Barcelona's 4-0 thrashing of Chelsea in the 2021 final were still raw when Caroline Graham Hansen netted in a 1-0 win at Stamford Bridge at this stage last season - a result which ultimately cost Chelsea a place in the final. But the Blues showed progression, drawing in Barcelona, as Hayes' ambitions of leading Chelsea to European glory took a step in the right direction despite a 2-1 aggregate defeat. So when they arrived in Spain this time around, there was a growing feeling of optimism, mixed with a desire to bounce back from their Women's FA Cup exit - and Chelsea showed that hunger in abundance. They relied on good fortune - helped by the video assistant referee [VAR] overturning a penalty call in the second half and former two-time Ballon d'Or winner Alexia Putellas slicing wide from a few yards out in stoppage-time - but they were always going to need that against Barcelona. This was a Chelsea performance that will live long in the memories of those travelling fans, who witnessed them upset a giant in Barcelona, and it gives them hope they can get over the line at Stamford Bridge next week. Chelsea came away from Spain with a clean sheet, having limited Barcelona to just one shot on target that came in stoppage time, having ridden an onslaught of late pressure from the hosts.  It was a tactical masterplan from Hayes as her side lined up in a back five and exploited space in behind Barcelona's attacking midfield with threatening wing-backs Johanna Rytting-Kaneryd and Ashley Lawrence putting in strong performances.  In defence, England international Jess Carter made countless blocks and interceptions, while Melanie Leupolz worked tirelessly in midfield to add to a mix of aggression and quality from Erin Cuthbert and Sjoeke Nusken.  Striker Mayra Ramirez stretched Barcelona's backline and held the ball up as each individual delivered Hayes' plan in Barcelona.  Their experience was evident too - they slowed the game down in the second half, frustrated a vociferous home crowd by delaying goal-kicks and throw-ins, and did not take risks when it was unnecessary.  It was the perfect start to a semi-final tie which was always going to be decided by a fine details and Hayes knows there is still plenty of battles to win in London.  Saturday's result was undoubtedly a great one but Hayes demands perfection - and that means winning the tie not just half of it. \"I'm not here to break records - no disrespect to Barcelona - but that's not a trophy for me,\" said Hayes afterwards. \"We're here to compete for the Champions League and we're at half-time against the best team in the world, who didn't have their best game today. Of course we disrupted that, but it doesn't count for anything.\" There was another rallying cry for supporters to come in their numbers - they have sold 24,000 tickets for the game at Stamford Bridge already - and they will need everything to go their way again when Barcelona's response arrives. But in a season where not everything has always gone to plan for Chelsea, this felt like a huge breakthrough in Barcelona."

        "text": " Last updated on 6 hours ago6 hours ago.From the section Championshipcomments492 Only two of the Championship's top four played on Saturday - but it may still have been a pivotal day in the race for automatic promotion to the Premier League. A day that started with what looked like a four-way fight for a top-two spot ended with Leicester in pole position and Southampton on the outside looking in. Ipswich and Leeds did not kick a ball but the Foxes' win over West Brom and the Saints' late defeat at Cardiff meant that the scales tipped towards them now battling it out for second spot. \"An important win especially at this stage of the season,\" Leicester boss Enzo Maresca told BBC Radio Leicester. \"We are now closer - we still need to win some games and to finish the season in the best way.\" Southampton boss Russell Martin said it was \"unacceptable\" to lose a game with the number of chances they had at Cardiff. \"[Saturday] has done us a lot of harm in terms of chasing the automatic spot, but we have to react properly now,\" he told BBC Sport Wales.  \"We've got three games left. We can still get more than 90 points. I expect a big reaction from everyone.\" BBC Sport examines the run-in and Opta predictions. If teams are level after 46 games, the title will be decided on goal difference and, if still level, goals scored. Fixtures in bold indicate key games between top-four teams Opta, with its 10,000 'supercomputer' simulations, has Leicester as favourites, with their chances boosted by Saturday's 2-1 win over West Brom.  They have a 77% chance of winning the title and 94% of sealing promotion. Ipswich have a 63% chance of securing back-to-back promotions, according to Opta - a figure that increased slightly from 62% following Southampton's defeat at Cardiff.  That loss in south Wales saw the Saints' chances of finishing in the top two slip from 11% to just 2%. Opta predict that the current top three will all pass the 90-point mark - nobody has reached that total and failed to be promoted in the past 10 seasons.  Southampton are predicted to get 88 points following Saturday's loss, with two of their final three games away at Leicester and Leeds.  \"The league is spectacular and you're a fool if you try and predict it because there's been so many twists and turns,\" former Ipswich and Luton striker Sam Parkin said on BBC Radio 5 Live.  Former Hull, Derby and Bolton manager Phil Brown added: \"It is all about bottle and the pressure. It is all about being able to handle that as a group and club.\" Should there be a tie, the league is decided on goal difference, then goals scored, then most points in the head-to-head matches, then goal difference in head-to-head games, before goals scored in those games. If all of that is level we go to number of wins, then goals scored in away games.  Whatever happens, there should be plenty more twists and turns between now and the final day of the season on 4 May. These comments are now closed."

Jurgen Klopp's side went level on points with Arsenal, who returned to the top of the table with a 2-0 victory over Wolves on Saturday. The Gunners, who have a better goal difference than Liverpool, sit one point clear of third-placed City. But City are given a 69.8% chance of winning a fourth consecutive Premier League title by Opta - thanks to their game in hand. This remains one of the tightest title races in years. Opta, with its 10,000 'supercomputer' simulations,external-link believes City's dressing room is the place to be. Arsenal and Liverpool's victories made little difference to the predictions, with City nominally down from 70.1% to 61.5%. Percentages in the table below show the chances of Liverpool, Manchester City or Arsenal winning each individual game, as predicted by Nielsen's Gracenote before this weekend's games. There have been a handful of three-way Premier League title races where the teams have been similarly close towards the end of a 38-game season. 2013-14: By as late as 6 May 2014, only two points separated Liverpool, Manchester City and Chelsea. City won their game in hand to leapfrog a stumbling Liverpool and went on to snatch the title. Liverpool's disappointment was characterised by Steven Gerrard's famous slip in their 2-0 defeat against Chelsea and then Crystal Palace's comeback from three goals down to draw 3-3. 2001-02: On 23 April 2002, Arsenal led Liverpool by a point with Manchester United a further point back. But Arsenal had a game in hand and were partway through a run of 11 consecutive wins. They sealed the title by beating United at Old Trafford. 1995-96: In mid-March, with eight games left, Manchester United were level on 61 points with Newcastle, and Liverpool were on 59 points in third. Despite having played two games more at the time, Sir Alex Ferguson's side saw off the challenge of Kevin Keegan's Magpies. Should there be a tie, the league is decided on goal difference, then goals scored, then most points in the head-to-head matches, then most away goals in the head-to-head record. Whatever happens, don't be too surprised if there are more twists and turns between now and the final day of the season on 19 May. These comments are now closed."

A corner is cleared by the Barcelona defence but it is clear Real have come into the game more. Real Madrid 1-1 Barcelona That penalty was Vinicius Junior's 13th league goal for Real this season. Unlucky for some, but not the Brazilian. Vinicius Junior (18 mins, penalty) Vinicius Junior kisses the ball before he puts it down on the spot and it works. He slots it to Marc-Andre ter Stegen's right. The Barca goalkeeper dives the right way but there is too much power on it. Real are level. Real Madrid 0-1 Barcelona Lucas Vasquez is fouled by Pau Cubarsi in the box and Real have an opportunity to equalise from the spot. Real Madrid 0-1 Barcelona Real's best chances so far have fallen to Vinicius Junior who hasn't managed to make the most of them. Real Madrid 0-1 Barcelona Lamine Yamal tries to catch Andriy Lunin out at his near post and Barcelona have another corner which is cleared by Federico Valverde. Real Madrid 0-1 Barcelona Joao Cancelo fouls Lucas Vazquez on the edge of the area. Toni Kroos takes the resulting free-kick but Vinicius Junior heads it over the bar. Antonio Rudiger is unhappy with his team-mate because he felt he had a better chance to score if Vinicius hadn't got there first. Real Madrid 0-1 Barcelona Real have had 70% possession so far in this match. It's only a matter of time before they make it count. Real Madrid 0-1 Barcelona Well, well, well. 10 minutes played and Real are behind. Plenty of time to turn it around but it is still a surprise given Real's current unbeaten streak. Real Madrid 0-1 Barcelona A clever flick on from Luka Modric into the path of Vinicius Junior who doesn't quite get hold of it and fires it over the bar. Andreas Christensen (6 mins) The first corner of the game goes to Barcelona. And Andreas Christensen heads it in! Raphinha swings the ball in and Andriy Lunin comes flying out without getting a hand to the ball.  Christensen is behind him, gets in front of Toni Kroos and heads Barcelona in front. Stunned silence at the Bernabeu. Real Madrid 0-0 Barcelona Vinicius Junior's shot from the edge of the area is blocked. Real Madrid 0-0 Barcelona Real captain Luka Modric is fouled by Frenkie De Jong and the host take the free-kick quickly. Real Madrid 0-0 Barcelona A shaky moment for Andriy Lunin who is pressed by Robert Lewandowski but Raphinha is unable to make the most of the opportunity. Real Madrid 0-0 Barcelona All systems go at the Estadio Santiago Bernabeu. A moment of silence was observed before the match began for Luis Gil Torres, former professional footballer and director of LaLiga competitions, who passed away today at the age of 48. Real Madrid v Barcelona (20:00 BST) \"We have a great opportunity to get closer to winning LaLiga,\" said Real boss Carlo Ancelotti at the pre-match press conference. Real have gone 16 games unbeaten and the fans at the Bernabeu are yet to see their side lose in 20 official matches this season (16 wins and four draws). Real Madrid v Barcelona (20:00 BST) Who will step up in this El Clasico? Almost time to find out. Real Madrid v Barcelona (20:00 BST) Real Madrid v Barcelona (20:00 BST) Real Madrid will be looking to do the league double over their rivals tonight. In the first El Clasico last October, Jude Bellingham scored two second-half goals including a 92nd minute winners as Real came from behind to beat Barca. Bellingham is second in the La Liga scoring charts on 16 goals, just two behind Girona's Artem Dovbyk. Real Madrid v Barcelona (20:00 BST) Real Madrid lead La Liga on 78 points with Barcelona eight points behind in second place. After this fixture, there will be six left for both sides. Is it all over or can Barcelona still challenge for the title? Thumbs up for Real Madrid, thumbs down for Barcelona."

        "text": " Last updated on 16 November 202316 November 2023.From the section Football Sign up for notifications to the latest Insight features via the BBC Sport app and find the most recent in the series. A Panenka penalty straight down the middle of the goal.  Spain goalkeeper Unai Simon dives to his right and gets nowhere near the ball. Achraf Hakimi, born in Madrid but belonging to Morocco, sets off in celebration. His manager and team-mates stream on to the pitch in pursuit. And, around the world, the celebrations begin. On London's Edgware Road, the car horns blare long and loud. Smoke from the flares cloaks the Christmas lights. Flags flap in the cold December air.   In Paris, in Berlin, in Rotterdam, the images are the same.  However, in the Spanish city of Valencia, it is a little more complicated. Morocco's last-16 win over Spain at the 2022 World Cup brought the past and present into conflict. Lina Chafik is a student. Born in Casablanca, she studies at the Polytechnic University of Valencia.  \"For me personally when we won against Spain, I could not go to uni the next day,\" she said.  \"The uni chat groups were not looking good. There was a lot of hate and I did not feel safe to go. \"The game against Spain was a little bit different because of the history that we have. \"Whether we won or lost, we were going to take it very personally. And so were they. The hateful comments from the chat had nothing to do with the game.  \"It was more about the colonisation, the fact that we come here to take their opportunities and stuff like that. \"It's very heated.\"  The heat comes from a tangled history. The present-day tension between the two nations is most clear in the twin coastal towns of Ceuta and Melilla. They have been pockets of Spanish territory on African soil for about 500 years.  Morocco, on whose northern Mediterranean coast they are situated, claim Ceuta and Melilla should revert to its control.    The border between Morocco and the two towns has become a flashpoint in relations - with African migrants attempting to cross into Ceuta and Melilla as a route into Europe.  In June 2022, at least 37 migrants died, external-linkcrushed to death between six-metre-high fences as the Moroccan border guards used tear gas and batons to hold back crowds attempting to enter Melilla. Morocco's influence spreads far across the Mediterranean Sea and back into Spain's history. In Andalusia, there is an enormous Islamic, Berber and Moorish influence that has shaped Spanish culture, language and architecture. Valencia, where Chafik studies, was once known as Medina al-Turab - the city of sand - and monuments that can trace their history back to 14th century Arab rule dot the city. Today, more than 800,000 Moroccans live in Spain, making them the largest expatriate population.  \"It's the closest European country to Morocco so it's the easiest to go to,\" explained Chafik. Taoufiq M is another Moroccan who moved to Spain, though he has since returned to the capital Rabat, where he watched that last-16 win at the World Cup. \"It was an emotional rollercoaster,\" he said. \"The drama was very intense. Luckily it had a happy ending for us which gave us lot of satisfaction and a lot of hope to believe in miracles. \"It was very satisfying to beat Spain because of the long history, the long rivalry between us and them, not only in the sports, but also militarily, politically and economically. It was an extremely sweet result to get one back on them.\" In Valencia, where Chafik watched the match, there was a heavy police presence during every game of the Atlas Lions' campaign.  \"Whenever there was a game with Morocco there was a lot of police outside because they know that there was a lot of Moroccans here,\" she said. \"It's not a good feeling that the police were only out when Morocco was playing, but I cannot say that I was where anything bad happened.\" Not everywhere was as peaceful. Arrests were made in the Spanish city of Granada, while footage posted on social media allegedly showed a confrontationexternal-link between police and female Morocco fans in Ceuta. Many of the Morocco team, like Chafik and Taoufiq, are, or have been, expatriates.  Fourteen players in last year's World Cup squad were born outside Morocco, and the Atlas Lions have close ties to countries such as France, Spain and the Netherlands.  Coach Walid Regragui embodied this. Born in France, he also played club football in Spain, but, internationally and emotionally, he was only ever Moroccan.  \"We didn't like the fact that previous coaches weren't Moroccan,\" explained Chafik.  \"So it felt different this time from the beginning. It felt like he wanted to win as much as the players and the fans because it would mean as much to him.\" She saw the Moroccan roots in the way the team spoke, as well as played.  \"A lot of them did grow up in other countries but I feel that they still hold on to their Moroccan side,\" said Chafik.  \"For example, Tamazight [North African language]. It's a very old language, translated from generation to generation. They don't teach it in schools.  \"Your parents would have to teach it to you and a lot of the players only speak Tamazight. \"So it was very heart-warming to see that even though they grew up in other countries they still had Morocco in them.\" On the pitch, the victory did away with an inferiority complex that had held back Morocco on the international stage. \"I think sometimes a Moroccan or African player has a complex when they have to play against European or South American teams,\" goalkeeper Yassine Bounou, who saved three penalties in the shootout win over Spain, told BBC World Service's Sportsworld. \"Morocco has shown that it is possible at the next World Cup for other African teams to emulate our performance. \"We opened a door as a team and showed that it is possible for everybody to beat big teams and big players.\" Spain and Morocco's rivalry on the pitch has reached a new level. Off it though, they are working together. Morocco is part of a joint bid to stage the 2030 World Cup, alongside Spain and Portugal, and are set to be ratified as hosts at a Fifa congress next year. \"I believe that Spain and Morocco joint bid will bring them closer. I think that the two countries will be close for as long as they have shared interests,\" said Taoufiq. \"But at the end of the day, they are competitors - and that competition will never go away.\""

        "text": " Last updated on 28 November 202328 November 2023.From the section Football Sign up for notifications to the latest Insight features via the BBC Sport app and find the most recent in the series. In June 2016, hundreds of fans gathered at Shanghai airport to watch one of the most famous footballers in the world make the city his home. Hulk, a 29-year-old Brazil international at the peak of his powers, had been signed by Shanghai SIPG manager Sven-Goran Eriksson for more than \u00a346m and would earn reported wages of \u00a3320,000 a week.  As he strode through arrivals, a welcoming bouquet of flowers was thrust into his arms and a Shanghai SIPG scarf draped over his neck. Over the next three years, he was joined by other big names, signed for even bigger price tags. Chelsea star Oscar arrived six months later. The transfer fee was about \u00a360m, while his wages were believed to be \u00a3400,000 a week. Carlos Tevez, who had won the Premier League with Manchester United and City, reportedly earned even more when he joined. Paris St-Germain star Ezequiel Lavezzi,Liverpool target Alex Teixeira and Colombia striker Jackson Martinez were also lured with astronomical transfer fees and bumper pay cheques. The rise of the Super League came alongside President Xi Jinping's wish to turn the country into a footballing nation. In 2011, he announced plans for the men's national team to qualify for a World Cup and for China to eventually host the tournament.  As the Chinese Super League began spending large sums of money, his ambition to turn the nation into a football super power started to look very real. \"The Chinese market is a danger for all teams in the world, not only for Chelsea,\" said the Blues manager Antonio Conte at the time on seeing Oscar head east. \"China looks to have the financial power to move a whole European league to China,\" said Arsenal counterpart Arsene Wenger. Less than a decade on, though, and the movement is in the opposite direction, with the bubble bursting and players leaving. Jack Sealy was not one of the big-name arrivals. The son of former QPR striker Tony Sealy, he signed for CSL's Changchun Yatai in December 2015. Sealy, then 28, had been playing in Hong Kong and was drawn to the Super League by the big names, the higher standard of football and the money that came with it. \"I went out there while it was still growing so it was very exciting to be around,\" he told the BBC. \"People had kind of heard about it before but no one really knew about it. And then as soon as you said to someone who knew football, they were like: 'Oh wow, you're going to the Super League.' \"I have no regrets about it at all. It was amazing.\"  Amazing, but also strange.  \"You kind of have to just completely forget who they are,\" he added of some of his big-name opposition. \"I've made the step up or they made the step down, however you see it, and you just have to see them as equals and try your best. But it was pretty surreal. \"Oscar - I've watched him play with Chelsea - and obviously from playing Fifa, you know all of the players. It was pretty incredible.\" By 2019, the league had become so big that Real Madrid's Gareth Bale - at one point the most expensive player in the world - was tipped for a move to Jiangsu Suning on a three-year, \u00a31m-a-week contract. Less than two years later, Jiangsu Suning ceased operating with their financial situation so bad that they even auctioned off the team's bus for cash. How did the Chinese football scene implode so spectacularly? Things went downhill when China's Football Association, which had already introduced a 'luxury tax' that made big-money transfersexternal-link prohibitively expensive and banned sponsors from naming teams after themselves, announced a salary cap in December 2020. At the time, the CFA said it hoped the move would \"curb money football\" and provide an \"investment bubble\" in the Chinese national team.   For some time, China's sport administration had been wary of the league's spending. In 2017, it vowed to curb spending and control \"irrational investment\", accusing clubs of \"burning money\" and paying foreign players with \"excessive salaries\".   The salary cap certainly had the desired effect. The limit meant overseas players would only be able to earn a maximum of \u00a352,000 a week, far lower than the contracts previously offered to star names. Some teams needed such restraints having piled up debts via their big spending. A large number of clubs' troubles were also exacerbated by their owners' growing problems in China' real estate sector with several home-building giants running into cash flow problems.  On top of everything, the Covid pandemic hit. China's strict containment policies reduced fixture lists and kept whatever games were staged behind closed doors for more than two years. Broadcast and sponsorship revenues duly plunged. Bosnia-Herzegovina defender Samir Memisevic played for Hebei FC from February 2020 - but by his second season at the club, could tell there were issues behind the scenes.  \"The second season, I thought that something was wrong,\" he told the BBC. \"After a few months, financial problems started. Then they had a big problem with the Chinese players - they didn't pay them for a lot of months and I was sure that at the end of that year Hebei would not exist any more.\" Memisevic received and accepted an offer to go on loan to Beijing Guoan, one of the top clubs in the league.  Hebei, who had signed Lavezzi and former Premier League regulars Javier Mascherano and Gervinho during the CSL's boom times, scrapped their youth teams in a desperate bid to survive. Some employees, furloughed without pay for months, offered to work for free as the club,external-link owned by a debt-ridden real estate company, struggled to pay its utility bills. It was all in vain though. Earlier this year, Hebei disbanded.  \"I just feel so sorry for Hebei and what happened because they were one of the biggest teams with loads of big names and money,\" said Memisevic, who now plays for Al-Nasr in Dubai. \"Now it's just disappeared. \"It's really sad but it's been a thing at a lot of Chinese clubs. I've seen that Guangzhou and Wuhan are also disappearing. It's just really sad. \"I hope that Chinese football will get better because they put a lot of money into it. But I don't think it will be the same like before.\" For John Hassett, the Chinese Super League will not be the same without his favourite team, Guangzhou City. The club, which has been managed by Eriksson and former Arsenal and Rangers star Giovanni van Bronckhorst in the past, also disbanded in March. Every home game, Hassett looked forward to meeting fellow fans and joining them to cheer on the team.  \"For lots of people, the social side was as important as the football,\" he told the BBC. \"We had this tiny little shop outside the ground, so we'd drink there before and after the game. It had also become the haunt of the local Chinese fan group after the game. It became quite a spot. \"We were all gutted. We did a little wake for the club at our beer shop after it closed down. We met up with a couple of other groups and had a beer outside the stadium. It was good fun. \"Part of the problem is that none of the clubs had set themselves up to make money. \"Tickets are very cheap. Our season ticket was \u00a350 or \u00a360. Some of the student groups were buying tickets cheaper than that. Most people don't buy the official shirts, they got them outside the stadium for \u00a33. \"Revenue generation for clubs is the biggest problem the Super League will have. As the economy tightens, where does the money come from?\" Late last year, as the countdown to reopening stadiums to fans began, another question was being asked; where has the money gone? A corruption scandal spread through the highest offices of the domestic game.  Former Everton midfielder and ex-head coach of China's men's team, Li Tie, was investigated for \"serious violations of the law\", with charges of bribery brought in August.external-link Chen Xuyuan, the Chinese Football Association's former chairman, is facing similar accusationsexternal-link while South Korea midfielder Son Jun-ho, who played for Shandong Taishan, has been detained since May on suspicion of accepting bribes.external-link Now, only a small number of foreign players remain in the league. Those currently playing in China, both local and foreign players, did not respond to interview requests from the BBC. But despite the league's problems, there is still a demand for domestic football.  When tickets for Beijing Guoan's first match back in front of a crowd went on sale in April, they sold out within five minutes.  Alberto Doldan, who has worked in China with La Liga and made deals in Asia as an agent, said that the aggressive acquisition of talent by top teams in Saudi Arabia currently is reminiscent of the CSL's peak. But he insists that the Chinese league still has a future, even if it is different from the one that once seemed possible.  \"Many teams in China have disappeared due to financial problems,\" he told the BBC. \"But I think the future will be better because they've been working with young players. I think in the next five, six or seven years, we'll get more local players with a higher level. \"China is still a good place. I think the future is in the local players.\" Now with fewer, flown-in superstars, the focus is on producing more homegrown superstars to grow the league and improve China's prospects at the World Cup, a tournament which, on the men's side, they have qualified for only once.

        "text": " Last updated on 2 hours ago2 hours ago.From the section Premier Leaguecomments256 Aston Villa came from behind to beat Bournemouth and keep their bid for a top-four finish and Champions League football on track. Just three days after booking their place in the semi-finals of the Europa Conference League with a penalty shootout win against Lille, Villa had to refocus as they push for their highest Premier League finish in 28 years. It did not begin well, though, as Bournemouth were handed the chance to take the lead from the penalty spot when Matty Cash brought down Milos Kerkez, and top-scorer Dominic Solanke made no mistake from 12 yards. But Villa remained positive and got their reward on the stroke of half-time when January signing Morgan Rogers fired into the roof of the net. Despite playing 120 minutes in Europe on Thursday, Villa showed no signs of fatigue and actually seemed to get stronger as the game went on. Winger Moussa Diaby put Villa in front in the 57th minute to cap a lovely team move before Leon Bailey gave the hosts breathing space 20 minutes later. Villa stay fourth and have opened up a six-point gap to Tottenham in fifth, although Spurs have two games in hand, while Bournemouth are 13th. It has been a celebratory seven days for Aston Villa, after the month started with just one point from two league outings.  Last Sunday they beat Premier League title hopefuls Arsenal, on Thursday they saw off Lille on penalties to reach a first major European semi-final since 1982 and it was another routine performance at Villa Park to stay in the driving seat for a top-four berth. Villa were calm and composed from the outset, controlling possession and making steady progress up the field, although they struggled to create any meaningful openings. It was not until Rogers' equaliser as the first half ticked into injury-time that Villa registered a shot on target. Rogers has settled well at Villa Park since signing for \u00a38m from Middlesbrough in January and he grabbed his second league goal for the club in very mature fashion, coolly evading the challenge of Adam Smith before carefully picking his spot high above the head of goalkeeper Neto. Villa settled into their groove as the second half began, with Ollie Watkins attempting two shots at goal but he was the provider, teeing up Diaby, to get the hosts in front. Unai Emery's side continued to press for a third and their endeavour paid off in the 78th minute when Watkins, who leads the way for assists in the Premier League with 12, broke into the area, squared the ball and Bailey had a simple finish. Speaking to BBC Match of the Day after the game, Emery said: \"Big effort because fifth place is not Champions League, because English teams lost it. We have to get fourth. We have to be demanding and prepare as well as perform. \"We have to be focused more than before because we thought fifth was Champions League, but now it is not. Tottenham have two games in hand and then of course we have to be in Conference League [semi-finals].\" Emery was referring to the fact that England's hopes of securing a fifth Champions League spot are all but over - with exits for four of the five remaining English clubs in European competitions this week leaving them trailing Italy and Germany in Uefa's coefficient rankings. Despite being without the ball for long periods in the first half, Bournemouth were efficient when they did get possession. Justin Kluivert tested Emiliano Martinez with a stinging effort from the edge of the box, before Dango Ouattara threatened the Argentina international's goal when he met a cross at the far post - but the angle was too acute and he could only find the side-netting. Bournemouth's penalty was as clear-cut as it comes, with Cash wrong-footed by a turning Kerkez, and Solanke fired beyond Martinez with the confidence of a man who now has 18 league goals to his name. Shortly after Villa had taken the lead Ouattara was denied from point-blank range by Martinez, in a moment that could have turned the game back in Bournemouth's favour. Substitute Enes Unal had the ball in the back of the net for the visitors, after Bailey had given Villa a two-goal cushion, but that was swiftly ruled out for offside. It may not have been an enjoyable trip to the Midlands for the south coast club but their season, which has five games left to run, could still end on a positive note. Bournemouth are just five points shy of achieving a club record tally in the Premier League, despite failing to win any of their opening nine games under Andoni Iraola. Speaking to BBC Match of the Day about Bournemouth's desire to set a new club record for points in the Premier League, Iraola said: \"That's what we are trying to do. We have a really difficult schedule to end the season. We have to be at our best. Have to keep focus, intensity. You cannot make mistakes against these types of teams.\" Player of the match WatkinsOllie Watkins 7.51 7.33 7.20 7.18 7.04 7.03 6.98 6.91 6.84 6.79 6.79 6.79 6.67 6.08 6.26 6.11 5.51 5.39 5.34 5.31 5.28 5.21 5.21 5.20 5.08 5.04 4.57 4.47 4.33 4.06 Formation  4-2-3-1 Formation  4-2-3-1 Match ends, Aston Villa 3, Bournemouth 1.

        "text": " Last updated on 4 April 20244 April 2024.From the section Football Sign up for notifications to the latest Insight features via the BBC Sport app and read the latest in the series here. Inaki Williams always knew his brother Nico was special, even if his younger sibling used to get so nervous he would ask Inaki, already a star in Bilbao, not to watch his youth games at the Athletic Club academy. Inaki is a pioneer. He helped raise Nico while their parents worked tirelessly to make ends meet, but also paved the way for his brother and other sons of immigrants to represent a club whose policy of only fielding players born or raised in the Basque Country inevitably meant the squad has historically reflected the predominantly white society around it. Inaki, 29, was not the first player of African heritage to represent the club - that was Jonas Ramalho, son of an Angolan father and Basque mother, in 2011 - but he is the first black player to establish himself at San Mames, having made more than 300 La Liga appearances, including an unprecedented 251 in a row. Nico, eight years his junior, is, in Inaki's words, now \"making waves in football\" too, and any nerves the youngster feels these days are channelled into realising childhood dreams of performing on the biggest stage alongside his big brother, mentor and guardian. \"As an older brother, it makes me really proud to see how he has grown, to see how he is improving as a footballer. He has no ceiling,\" Inaki tells BBC Sport. \"I'm here to help him, to teach him and give him everything he needs.\" It is a journey that began long ago, and a long way from Bilbao. Their mother, Maria, was pregnant with Inaki when she left Ghana with father Felix in search of a better life. The couple crossed part of the Sahara barefoot. Inaki only learned the full extent of their story when he was 20. He had known his father had problems with the soles of his feet, but not that scorching sand was the reason why. external-link Felix and Maria made it to the Spanish territory of Melilla in north Africa, jumping a border fence, but were detained by the civil guard. A lawyer advised them to lie, to say they were from war-torn Liberia instead and seek political asylum. He arranged help in Bilbao from Catholic priest Inaki Mardones, who met the couple at Abando railway station when Maria was seven months pregnant, found them an apartment and took them to hospital for Inaki's birth. Mardones baptised the future star, even gave him his first football shirt, and became his godfather.  He is whom Inaki takes his name from. Not that settling in Spain made life easy for the family. They were given state housing in Pamplona and worked any jobs they could.  Felix moved to London in search of more opportunities, working the turnstiles at Chelsea's Stamford Bridge, and Inaki - still a child - stepped in to help his mum raise Nico. \"We had to suffer a lot,\" says Inaki, who would contribute to the family finances by refereeing football matches before his gift for the sport was enough to bring Felix home and end his search for work. \"Thanks to God we are all here together now, living a really good life. My parents are getting to watch their sons prosper, which is why they came here. Everything we do is for our parents.\" On Athletic's radar for several years before officially joining the youth set-up aged 18, Inaki made his senior debut two years later in December 2014, sporting the same red and white jersey he wore as a boy. \"Inaki had a very difficult life when he was very young,\" explains Athletic sporting director Mikel Gonzalez. \"He knows what his responsibility is, so you can see him like a superhero. His mum is, for sure.\" Maria would always be there to watch her boys' matches. Nico joined the academy aged 12, when Inaki was already breaking into the first team, and began to forge his own path to stardom. \"It was incredible watching him play,\" says former Athletic head coach Gaizka Garitano. \"So easy. He was very fast, incredible speed. Even more skilful than his older brother. \"Their mother was key for their improvement. Not only in football but also in the way they are, the respect of everybody. It was very tough for them, Inaki especially. \"Inaki lived this situation at home very hard, without any money. \"The character of Inaki is based on that time. He is very humble, always trying to learn from the coaches, and is very respectful.\" On Saturday the brothers will try to help Athletic win a first major trophy in 40 years when they face Mallorca in the Copa del Rey final in Seville.  More than 100,000 fans are expected to make the trip by air, rail or eight-hour drive, most without tickets. If Athletic return with the trophy, the legend of the Williams brothers will be immortalised. The club's importance, especially in the Basque province of Bizkaia, is clear.  Athletic are an institution, visible in all aspects of daily life. Each baby born in the region in 2023 received a bib commemorating the club's 125th anniversary. So vast is their youth network that they boast more than 160 partnership clubs and every football-playing boy at under-11s level trains at the club's Lezama base at least once this season. As sporting director Gonzalez puts it: \"The first song you learn is the Athletic song. The first jersey you have is the jersey of Athletic. Your first time in a football stadium is always in San Mames.\" After a friendly appearance for Spain in 2016, Inaki chose instead to represent Ghana at international level. Nico meanwhile has committed fully to Spain, making four appearances at the Qatar 2022 World Cup. Both are also Basque. Athletic are at the heart of that, providing Basque language lessons for all employees and celebrating Basque history and culture. Even people without a general interest in football see the team as a vehicle for expressing their identity, a sense of belonging. \"A religion,\" one taxi driver calls it. He is at a wedding on Saturday but will join the bride and groom in front of the TV for kick-off at 10pm local time.  \"Sometimes you find people who don't really like football, but still they are Athletic fans,\" explains midfielder Ander Herrera. \"That's unique in the world. You see people who have been season ticket holders all their lives and they don't watch other games; they only watch Athletic. \"In Bilbao, you find a woman who is 60 or 70 years old, she stops you in the street and she says to you that we have to win the cup and we have to qualify for the Champions League.\" Right now the city is decorated red and white. Flags hang from apartment windows, offices and council buildings. One metro station is decked out like San Mames, with a backdrop of fans looking over arrivals and departures. Kids have been delivering letters to Athletic's headquarters - the grand Ibaigane Palace - for players to open when they get to Seville. At Bar Ledesma, where Pena Los Inakis, a fan club dedicated to the older Williams sibling, meet, you can eat Athletic crisps and sip club-branded beer. Near the stadium, in the heart of the city, banners flutter and even a mannequin in a wedding dress sports an Athletic scarf in a bridal shop window. The club have been the bridesmaid too many times since their most recent Copa del Rey triumph in 1984. Six final defeats, including two in as many weeks when the pandemic delayed a heartbreaking loss to rivals Real Sociedad, have followed. There is a sense that, with Mallorca 15th in La Liga, this is Athletic's best opportunity yet to end a long wait for major silverware. The brothers, playing either side of the front three, have been fundamental in this cup run. Immediately after Ghana were knocked out of the Africa Cup of Nations, Inaki, flew back via Paris to arrive in Bilbao at 11am on the day of the quarter-final against Barcelona. He came off the bench that evening to score in extra time before setting up Nico in a 4-2 victory. Then, in the 3-0 semi-final second-leg win against Atletico Madrid, they assisted each other again. San Mames, 'the Cathedral', rejoiced.  \"In terms of football, they are key,\" says Herrera. \"But on the personal side they are fantastic guys, always positive, always smiling.  \"Even when they argue, which we have seen a few times, like a brother discussion, it is so funny for us and we love it.\" Just don't mention La Gabarra. In the successful 80s, when Athletic won back-to-back titles and the double in 1984, it became tradition for players to celebrate on a barge on the River Nervion. Some believe talking about it since has become a jinx.  Pictures from those triumphs show a different Bilbao, an industrial city. Now it is an innovative hub of contemporary architecture with the Guggenheim museum, situated on the riverbank where a factory once stood, at the heart of its regeneration. The football club reflects and embraces change, too. Throughout the youth system there are now players whose parents moved from Africa, South America or elsewhere. Midfielder Junior Bita, born in Ivory Coast, made the matchday squad last season. In the summer winger Alvaro Djalo will join from Braga. He is of Guinean descent and moved to Bizkaia as a baby. \"It was just part of the historical process of the country,\" explains journalist Benat Gutierrez. \"The Basque Country got a lot of immigrants before, but they were coming from other parts of Spain, therefore they were mainly white. \"African immigrants started coming in the late 80s, early 90s, probably the bigger influx in the 2000s, and it was just younger adult men who were not ready to start a sports career here.  \"It has been a process until we are seeing the sons or even the grandsons of those new Basque citizens that are starting to be really important for Athletic.\" The club's all-Basque selection policy began following a dispute about Athletic using English players in the 1911 Copa del Rey. With the Spanish football federation introducing a rule the following season that players must be Spanish, an aggrieved Athletic went one step further. Through stubbornness and success, picking from a population of about three million has worked for more than a century - Athletic have never been relegated from Spain's top tier and trail only Real Madrid and Barcelona in terms of trophies won. Critics call it xenophobic or racist. Some cite the case of Miguel Jones, a Bilbao native born in Equatorial Guinea who trained with the club. Policy at the time, however, dictated players must be born locally, so Jones was let go and instead enjoyed a successful career at Atletico Madrid in the 1960s. Jones himself dismissed claims of racism, citing white players who experienced the same fate, and celebrated Inaki's emergence before his death in 2020. Perhaps more poignant than a trophy, then, will be the Williams brothers' legacy. \"It has been very rewarding to see how Athletic has evolved across time,\" says Gaizka Atxa, the Mexico-born founder of a fans' group named after Fred Pentland, a legendary former English coach of the club.  \"Athletic is a reflection of our society here and seeing the Williams brothers flourish means that any immigrant or son of immigrants has a decent opportunity to play for our club.  \"That just opens wide possibilities as to what Athletic could become in the next few decades.\" How long they will continue to flourish together is a topic of debate. Nico, who wears 'Williams Jr' on his back, is highly sought-after, notably from Chelsea, where his father once tore tickets. The 21-year-old's individual goalexternal-link against Atletico in December was one of six he has scored in 29 games for Athletic this season. He is also joint second in La Liga's assist standings. \"Inaki is helping Nico a lot in everything,\" says sporting director Gonzalez. \"Nico is a very good player, but he is very young and you can imagine a lot of noise around him with clubs, with agents. But Inaki is the best example of hard work.\" Athletic fans can reluctantly accept when a star player goes as long as they leave money - in the form of a fat transfer fee - on the table. Aymeric Laporte, a \u00a357m departure to Manchester City, for example. Nico's previous contract was due to expire in June 2024, but in December he signed an extension through to 2027, under his brother's guidance. \"Inaki, of course, was also in on these decisions with his family,\" says Gonzalez. \"They feel very well here in Bilbao. They believe in the project. They are very happy with the team, with the coach, with everything. They also have the love of the supporters. \"For sure, at another club Nico could have gone for free to a Champions League club, earning much more money or winning more titles. But in this moment he has the feeling he has to continue here and Inaki is a very important person for him to take the best decisions in his professional career.\" In any case, Nico and Inaki have unfinished business in Bilbao, a cup final to win - for the fans, for the city, for the club, for Felix and Maria."

The voice of BBC commentator Raymond Glendenning crackles out of the radio. \"And this time a neat backpass by Soo finds Matthews...\" The date is 20 October 1945. World War Two has only been over for a month. As people across England crowd around their radios, they can hear 54,000 fans roaring on their team against Wales at the Hawthorns. Nearly 80 years on, while Stanley Matthews remains one of English football's most enduring names, Frank Soo is a relative unknown. Yet Soo's story, one of adversity, celebrity and then obscurity, is significant. And slowly being recognised once more. Three years earlier - on 9 May 1942 - a 28-year-old Soo played his first game for England, also against Wales, in front of 30,000 people at Cardiff's Ninian Park. It was a historic debut. Soo became the first non-white man to play for England. He was already the first Chinese player in the English Football League. And he remains the only player of Asian descent to represent England at senior level. In the 1930s Soo was a star. A household name who appeared on cigarette cards and featured in newspapers, he was described as a talented half-back, clever, quick with an eye for an incisive pass and able to play in any position. England team-mate Stan Mortensen summed up Soo's style. \"Everything he did was hall-marked,\" wrote Mortensen in his book Football is My Game. \"He seemed incapable of a clumsy movement.\" But Soo's fame faded in the following decades. To the vast majority of fans, his name is unknown. Soo was born in 1914 in Buxton, Derbyshire, a few months before the start of the First World War. His mother Beatrice was English and his father Quan was Chinese. They met in the Manchester area and, at the time of their marriage, were registered as living at the same address. In the 1911 census there were only 1,319 China-born citizens residing in England and Wales in a population of about 35 million. The main source of income for many Chinese immigrants, including Quan, was running steam laundries, a quintessential working-class job for many settlers. Laundry work was traditionally performed by women, so the Chinese community faced less hostility because they were seen as taking women's jobs rather than men's. Even so, Chinese workers were caught in an impossible situation. If they did work, they were accused of stealing local jobs. If they did not, they were deemed idle. Women who married immigrants automatically lost their British nationality and became foreigners. The hostility they faced would occasionally turn into social unrest. The first Chinese laundry in London was stoned soon after it openedexternal-link in 1901. During the 1911 Cardiff riots all 30 Chinese laundries in the city were targeted. Quan and Beatrice moved to Buxton and, after spells in different areas, had settled in West Derby in Liverpool by 1920, running a popular laundry on Town Row. Soo's footballing abilities were clear from a young age and he joined Prescot Cables as an 18-year-old in 1932. Although he was scouted by Liverpool and Everton, Stoke City declared their interest and manager Tom Mather signed him for \u00a3400 in 1933.  Promoted to the top flight in Soo's first season, Stoke were a thrilling and elegant side, with Soo dovetailing with the legendary Matthews. By 1938, a 24-year-old Soo was Stoke captain, and the demands of fans and journalists for him to be called up by England were increasing. The outbreak of war delayed his promotion to the international stage before he made his debut in 1942. Soo played 260 matches for Stoke between 1933 and 1945, including wartime friendlies and cup games, scoring 20 goals in the process. He also became a national icon. His wedding with his first wife, Beryl Lunt, made headlinesexternal-link in the Staffordshire Sentinel in 1938 after attracting a crowd of 2,000 of well-wishers despite attempts to keep the ceremony a secret. The article also revealed that the honeymoon would be spent in Bournemouth. The media rarely published details about footballers' personal lives, but Soo's stardom caused this excitement. His Chinese heritage was part of the intrigue. \"It was regarded as a novelty,\" said Susan Gardiner, author of The Wanderer: The Story of Frank Soo. \"They were intrigued by the fact that this very young, talented Chinese player had joined Stoke City... rather than [being] hostile towards him.\" Nevertheless, Soo had to deal with regular references to his race and his name being used in disrespectful pun-filled headlines. Ronnie Soo, Frank's nephew, said in the documentary Frank Soo: The Forgotten Legendexternal-link that there were \"cartoons of him as a Chinese character with a football at his feet\". Generally, Soo received positive coverage and, seen grinning in photographs of the time, it is easy to understand why he was referred to as 'The Smiler'. Soo served in the Royal Air Force in World War Two but continued to play club football after the Football Association suspended the Football League and organised regional Wartime Leagues. He also captained the Royal Air Force and Forces XI. Soo played nine games for England, including a 3-2 win over Scotland in front of 133,000 fans at Hampden Park in 1944. However, because he only played during the war and games were deemed unofficial by the FA, those appearances were never recognised with caps. The usual club competitions were suspended at the outbreak of war and the practicalities of conflict affected international games. \"Players in the services or civilian work could only play if it did not interfere with their military service or war work,\" said Dr Alexander Jackson, curator at the National Football Museum and author of Football's Great War. \"While the FA encouraged good relations with the armed forces and the release of service players for international games, due to their value in raising morale and raising funds for charity, it could not compel the forces to release a player. \"The deployment of military personal abroad, and the loss of players through military service, meant that the FA was restricted in who it could select. \"The war would have placed obstacles in the way of FA selectors observing players and recommending them for international honours in the same way as in peacetime.\" Soo was 25 when war broke out, the peak of many playing careers. By the time the war was over, he was 31. He still came close to making his England career official. Called up for another peacetime England international in 1946, Soo pulled out with an ankle injury and was replaced by bright young star Billy Wright. Wright, a future England captain, won his first official cap against Ireland eight months later, supplanting Soo in the team and ensuring his international career would never be officially recognised. After short spells playing for Leicester City, Luton Town and Chelmsford City, Soo moved into management. It took him abroad in 1952 and his memory faded from English football. His reputation was reinforced overseas as he led Norway to the 1952 Olympics and won the Swedish top flight with Djurgardens IF in 1955. Following his final recorded managerial role with Danish side Akademisk Boldklub in 1965-66, very little is known about Soo. It is suggested that he moved back to north-west England in the mid-1970s before settling in Stoke. Fans recall seeing him at local matches, showing them cigarette cards from his glory days. \"When he was back in England, he was suffering from what's now known as Alzheimer's,\" said Ronnie. \"He was in care but in later years he did deteriorate.\" Soo died of dementia on 25 January 1991 in Staffordshire. His ethnicity, his move abroad, the impact of the war and the relatively sparse media coverage of football in his playing heyday contributed to Soo's relative anonymity, but much has been done over the past decade to celebrate his achievements. In 2016 Gardiner's book pieced together local history, family records and newspapers archives to produce the most comprehensive record yet of Soo's story. A year later, coach and community champion Alan Lau, having read the book, founded the Frank Soo Foundation to promote Soo's story.   In 2020 the foundation worked with Google to feature Soo as the search engine's 'Doodle'external-link, putting his likeness in front of millions of web browsers worldwide. This month he was inducted into Stoke's Sporting Hall of Fame, marked by a half-time commemoration at the Bet365 Stadium. Across town, on the site of Stoke's former Victoria Ground home, there is Frank Soo Street named in honour of a club legend. There is scope for further commemoration. In March Jack Leslie was awarded a posthumous cap by the FA. Leslie was the first black player to receive an England call-up in 1925, but his invite to play for his country was withdrawn when, his family believe, selectors realised the colour of his skin. Soo, and the Asian heritage players that have followed in his wake, still await a breakthrough England cap. Li Ke, who was known as Nico Yennaris during his time growing up in London and playing for Arsenal, Brentford and England's age-group sides, in 2019 became the first naturalised player to represent China. Jiang Guantai, known as Tyias Browning while playing for Everton, Sunderland and England Under-21s, is now a regular for China. In the women's game, Aston Villa's Maz Pacheco has said she is undecided over whether to play for the Philippines or England. Before them all came Soo - a pioneer for non-white representation in English football, a Stoke City icon and a successful manager who overcame adversity in life and is emerging from anonymity in death."

        "text": " Last updated on 20 April 202420 April 2024.From the section Man Citycomments1706 Manchester City boss Pep Guardiola says it is \"unacceptable\" that his side had to play an FA Cup semi-final so soon after a Champions League quarter-final. City overcame Chelsea 1-0 to reach a second successive final but Guardiola criticised their schedule after the penalty shootout defeat by Real Madrid. Guardiola said Coventry and Manchester United - who play on Sunday at Wembley - should have played on Saturday. \"I don't understand how we survived,\" added the City boss. City lost on penalties to Real Madrid on Wednesday after the teams were locked 4-4 on aggregate after extra time. Guardiola's argument is that the other FA Cup semi-final between Manchester United and Coventry, who are not in European competition, should have been switched to Saturday to allow his players an extra day to recover. \"It's unacceptable to let us play today,\" he told BBC Sport. \"It's impossible, for the health of the players. It's not normal.  \"One hundred and twenty minutes, the emotions of Madrid, the way we lose, honestly. I know this country is special [with the FA Cup] but it's for the health of the players.\" Guardiola was animated after full-time on Saturday, hugging his players on the pitch and waving his arms in the air towards City's supporters. Later, in his news conference, Guardiola continued with his criticism - describing the domestic and international calendar as \"unsustainable\". City's next match is on Thursday, when they play at Brighton in the Premier League (20:00 BST). \"I just want to protect my players. It's common sense. I'm not asking for something special or privilege,\" Guardiola said. Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta, whose team beat Wolves in the Premier League on Saturday after losing to Bayern Munich in the Champions League on Wednesday, agreed with Guardiola's comments. \"It's not about us, Pep or myself. It's about the wellbeing of the players,\" said Arteta, who was Guardiola's assistant at City before joining Arsenal in 2019. \"When you compete in European competition, every team has to compete in the same way.  \"You cannot have a team that hasn't played for seven days, or three days before and has more recovery time, and then you have to play in the Premier League and the FA Cup. It is not right.\" There are still set to be clashes between domestic competitions and Uefa matches when the 2024-25 fixture calendar is confirmed next month, despite FA Cup replays being scrapped. The Premier League, Football Association and English Football League feel they have been left in an impossible situation, due to Uefa's decision to expand its three club competitions and the introduction of the new Fifa Club World Cup at the end of next season."

        "text": " Last updated on 6 February 20246 February 2024.From the section European Football Sign up for notifications to the latest Insight features via the BBC Sport app and find the most recent in the series here. Ibrahima Traore smiles as he parks his black Range Rover outside the apartment block where his footballing story began.  He is back in Pantin, just outside the north-east corner of the peripherique - the ring road that separates central Paris from its suburbs.  Amid the din of sirens and the aroma of fast food, Traore buzzes in and takes the lift to the fifth floor. The doors open and his brother is waiting to welcome him back to their childhood home. Inside, there are photos of the pair's Guinean father and Lebanese mother, as well as shots of grandparents and younger generations of the family. Dominating the view through the floor-to-ceiling windows, across a dual carriageway and tramline, is a vast sports complex, with two 4G football pitches. \"That's our Camp Nou, our Anfield,\" Traore says. \"We used to jump over the fence at seven in the morning to practise our free-kicks. Before school and after school, it was football. Only football.\" For many of the kids growing up here, constant practice can lead to the ultimate reward - a career in the professional game. Traore, now 35, played more than 250 games for four different clubs in Germany's Bundesliga and captained Guinea at the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations.  His inspiration growing up came from the success around him, rather than the television screen. \"I remember just across the street, we had the player who used to play for Manchester United: Gabriel Obertan,\" says Traore. \"It's the dream from everyone and then even more when you have someone who comes from the same suburb who makes it. \"When you hear that it's possible that, being from this area, you can play for a team like Manchester United, that is something that you want to follow, you want to pursue.\" As the clock strikes 4pm, children and coaches flood on to the pitches below. Aston Villa's Moussa Diaby, former Arsenal winger Nicolas Pepe and France and Monaco defender Youssouf Fofana all started out at the same facility, which is shared by local clubs Esperance Paris 19eme and Solitaire Paris Est. On the biggest stage of them all, Paris' finest are everywhere.  Thirty players at the 2022 men's World Cup in Qatar were born in the vicinity of France's capital. Compare that to two other hotbeds of youth football: Sao Paulo provided 12 World Cup players and Greater London eight. There were 11 Parisians in the France squad that lost to Argentina in the final, with the other 19 spread across eight national teams: Morocco, Tunisia, Senegal, Ghana, Cameroon, Portugal, Germany and Qatar. And then you have the icons of the recent past. World Cup winners Thierry Henry, N'Golo Kante and Paul Pogba all grew up in the banlieues(suburbs) of the French capital, as did Kante's former Leicester team-mate Riyad Mahrez.   How has Paris become a city that churns out more football talent than anywhere else? Post-war immigration from football-loving former French colonies in north and west Africa is the obvious reason why Ile-de-France - as suburban Paris is known - is such a remarkable football factory.  Traore was born in Paris before moving to Guinea, settling back in the French capital from the age of four with his mother and siblings.   \"You have a lot of people from North Africa round here; we used to say they are the real street footballers,\" he adds.  \"Then you have a lot of Senegalese, Guinean, Malian people round here. In the summer, we used to do an Africa Cup. All the Guinean players would be in one team. All the Malian players, they will be in one team. Ivory Coast\u2026 whatever you want. It's crazy, because everyone is defending his country, and then it's just insane.\" It was during one of these informal tournaments that a local scout spotted Traore and set him on the path of a professional career. But that influx of talent and culture also emerged into an environment perfect for super-charging player development. A local government policy of building high-quality football facilities in every Paris banlieue, partly to keep kids off the streets and out of trouble, has been fundamental to making the sport cheap and accessible to all. \"You come down from your building and you have a football field, so the first thing you do is go play football,\" says Abdelaziz Kaddour, sports director of FC Montfermeil 93, a thriving club in Seine Saint-Denis, a suburban Paris region with one of the highest crime and unemployment rates in France.  Abdelaziz and Montfermeil oversaw the development of Arsenal defender William Saliba after he transferred from nearby AS Bondy, the club where France superstar Kylian Mbappe played as a child. \"Young people round here play football practically all day long,\" says Abdelaziz.  \"And on top of that, most of the pitches are small. That means, they touch the ball a lot. They learn to dribble. And over time, it gives them a lot of quality, dribbling, speed, seeing things before others, tackling, intensity.  \"And what's more, they want to make a living from football. They have the spirit. When you ask them the question, they want to be professional footballers at all costs.  \"This is not an easy place to live. Many families are in difficulty. The children know it and give their all to succeed. It builds a mentality and that perhaps makes the difference, in addition to talent.\" Sebastien Bassong, the former Tottenham, Newcastle and Cameroon defender, began his passage to football stardom at Deuil Enghein, a club located in Val d'Oise, directly to the north of Paris. He says football is \"in the DNA\" of those who grow up in the banlieues. \"There's a certain mindset that's very contagious,\" says Bassong. \"I've got bigger brothers, so to make myself a name was difficult. But as soon as I started playing football, people started seeing me differently. I started to exist as soon as football came into my life. I started to puff my chest out a bit.\" Bassong's talents were such that at the age of 13, he followed the path taken by Henry and Nicolas Anelka to Clairefontaine, the world-famous residential academy that has long cherry-picked the best talent from the Ile-de-France area. \"We call it the Harvard of football,\" says Bassong. \"Most of my football IQ came from Clairefontaine. You think football, you drink football, you smell football, you sleep with your ball and, above all, you learn discipline. They develop champions.\" Those not fortunate enough to be spotted by the scouts of Clairefontaine improve their skills in one of the biggest and most competitive amateur leagues in world football.  The Ligue de Paris Ile-de-France has more than 1,000 clubs and 270,000 players. It's such an important organisation that it has an office in the picture-perfect Place Valois, a well-struck free-kick away from the Louvre museum, right in the heart of Paris. \"Some of the great French players, or players who play in the major European leagues, say that what served them best was training in the Ile-de-France, that the level was very, very good,\" says the league's president Jamel Sandjak, a former defender of Algerian descent who played in the league before moving into football administration. \"Most of the France national youth teams are full of our players. So our regional teams are playing at national level. Scouts from all over the world come to Ile-de-France to look at players in our leagues.\" The proliferation of foreign scouts explains the vast numbers of Parisian players who end up in the Premier League, with Liverpool's Ibrahima Konate and Chelsea's Axel Disasi among the latest batch. Konate even returned to his old Paris banlieue to unveil his Liverpool shirt,external-link while a delirious crowd lit red flares and chanted his name. English teams have benefited from the fact that Paris St-Germain, the one truly elite club in the Paris region, has long favoured spending on overseas galacticos over developing homegrown talent. This policy came back to bite them in their one and only Champions League final in 2020, when they lost 1-0 to Bayern Munich, the winner scored by Kingsley Coman, a player PSG had released on a free transfer to Juventus six years earlier. Yves Gergaud, a former PSG youth coach who scouted Coman at the age of nine, says the then-18-year-old winger's departure from the Qatari-owned club was prompted by the \u00a333.5m arrival of Brazilian Lucas Moura to play in his position.  \"It's all about business,\" says Gergaud.  \"For 15 or 20 years now, they have wanted to win the Champions League, and they are trying to achieve that by attracting very great players, like Messi, like Neymar, like Thiago Silva. \"But unfortunately, they are still perhaps missing a little bit of soul.  \"You have the academy in one corner, and the pro team in another corner, directors and managers changing all the time, so it's very difficult to really develop players. But it's true that you could field three or four teams of players from the Paris region in the Champions League.\" For their part, PSG owner Nasser Al-Khelaifi insists the era of \"flashy bling-bling\" is overexternal-link and the club point to the emergence of 17-year-old midfielder Warren Zaire-Emery - now a starter for France as well as his club - as evidence that the academy and first team are more closely attuned. Gergaud is not convinced. \"I was at Paris St-Germain from 2002 to 2007 and people were already saying that at the time,\" he adds.  \"There is good work done in the academy. The scouts do a good job - they manage to detect very good young people but then it's difficult to get them to the first team because they don't have a reserve team and they find themselves being restricted to the under-19 championship. \"So there are players who can be ready like Warren Zaire-Emery at 16 or 17 years old, but there are others who should be able to keep developing at PSG and reach the first team.\" The concentration of young talent in one city and its suburbs has created something of a circus around Paris' grassroots football.  Montfermeil sporting director Abdelaziz says there are often more scouts and agents than family members on the sidelines. \"When I started, I was scouting a lot in the Paris area but now it's starting to be impossible,\" says Jennifer Mendelewitsch, an agent from Supernova Management, based in the Bois de Boulogne in western Paris. \"There are too many agents, too many people are trying to find the kid, the boy, who's going to make it. Right now, it's the jungle to get a player in the Paris area.  \"You speak to a family and they already have agents and the kid is only 12. It's way too early. Let them be a kid. If they're going to make it, they're going to make it.\"  Even as she delivers the words, Mendelewitsch knows she's fighting a lost cause.  With Mbappe and Zaire-Emery at the head of an army of talent, the battle for the brightest stars in the city of lights is as fierce as any on the pitch."

        "text": " Last updated on 1 hour ago1 hour ago.From the section Evertoncomments32 Everton manager Sean Dyche ditched his trademark white shirt and dark tie for the angry PE teacher look as an indication that the party was over for his humiliated players and everyone else at this under-siege football club. Dyche appeared just as likely to order 10 press-ups as bark tactical instructions in his tight-fitting t-shirt and tracksuit bottoms but there was method behind his striking sartorial switch. In a week spent soaking up the embarrassment of the 6-0 loss at Chelsea, Dyche and his staff explored all aspects of what could provoke a reaction and improvement, not only from his struggling squad but those in the technical area. And Dyche can look back on a winning start with his new shop floor image after a vital 2-0 win against fellow strugglers Nottingham Forest at Goodison Park. \"I knew it would be a talking point,\" said Dyche. \"I'm not precious either way but we looked at everything. I always thought it was correct to wear a shirt and tie but I just thought I'd play my part in what I was looking for from my players and staff.\" Everton certainly produced a sleeves-rolled-up performance, long-range strikes from Idrissa Gueye and Dwight McNeil in each half edging them five points clear of Luton Town in the relegation places with a game in hand. It was not pretty. It was never going to be. It was a dogfight, a tense, error-riddled match between two clubs who have suffered points deductions for breaching profit and sustainability rules this season - both still hoping appeals will further aid their fight to avoid relegation. Forest's feeling of disappointment was heightened by their sense of injustice that major decisions went against them. They certainly had a case when Ashley Young handled just before the break with the score 1-0 and then when the veteran, who sailed close to the wind all game, clumsily tumbled into Callum Hudson-Odoi as he raced into the area after the break. The club's very public expression of discontent on social media just after the final whistle touched on Forest's fury as it said: \"We warned the PGMOL that the VAR is a Luton fan before they game but they didn't change him. Our patience has been tested multiple times. NFFC will now consider its options.\" What options Forest can consider is open to question but what they must think about is the cold reality of the fact they are now deep in trouble, only one point behind Luton Town. They must hope for respite from their appeal against the points deduction but they cannot count on it. For Everton, things suddenly look a little rosier following the 6-0 Chelsea debacle after a winning start to a potentially decisive week in their season, with a Merseyside derby to come against Liverpool at Goodison Park on Wednesday before a home meeting with Brentford next Saturday evening. Yes, they rode their luck but this was a deserved victory carved in the same image of most of the wins Dyche has enjoyed at Goodison Park. Gritty, unspectacular but, in this case at least, hugely important. Everton would be sitting pretty if they had not been deducted eight points. It means they still have work to do but this win means there is some light at the end of what has been a very dark tunnel on and off the pitch this season. Jarrad Branthwaite showed once again why he has been so valuable this season, and may be such a hot property in the summer, with another towering defensive display and the goals from Gueye (a rare shot on target from a player who does not count that as one of his qualities) and McNeil lit up what was, for long periods, a drab game. Dyche will have relished the manner of this win and how he needed it with Everton's unfailingly loyal and supportive followers not only concerned by results but also the stodgy playing style that has led them into trouble. It means they might just be in better heart as they attempt to stick a spoke in the wheels of Liverpool's title bandwagon on Wednesday. The big question now is, after a change of clothes brought a change of luck, whether Dyche reverts back to his suit on what might be a chilly Merseyside night. If the tracksuit brings another win neither Dyche nor Everton's fans will feel the cold."

        "text": " Last updated on 20 April 202420 April 2024.From the section Premier Leaguecomments944 Arsenal put their Champions League disappointment firmly in the past to beat Wolves at Molineux and move back to the top of the Premier League. Having blown their chance to leapfrog Pep Guardiola's side six days ago by losing at home to Aston Villa, then been knocked out of the Champions League by Bayern Munich on Wednesday, it was a welcome triumph for Mikel Arteta's men. Leandro Trossard's strike in the last minute of the opening period may not have been the most eye-catching of the Belgian's career but it was perfectly timed. It came at the end of a half where Arsenal seemed to have got stuck after a bright start and nearly fell behind to Gary O'Neil's injury-ravaged side. The visitors dominated the second half too but were unable to carve out the clear chances that would have allowed them to take the game out of reach. Captain Martin Odegaard added the second deep into stoppage time at the end of the game, turning in from a tight angle after his initial cross had been blocked. \"I really liked the performance, the result, the clean sheet,\" said Gunners boss Arteta. \"But especially the way the team has individually shown that they still have another step forward to make and resilience that is needed in these moments to step in and say 'I'm here, I'm gonna make myself count and impact the team'.\" The result means Arsenal are now a point clear of City, with a better goal difference but having played a game more. They have the chance to apply some significant pressure to the defending champions when they entertain beaten FA Cup semi-finalists Chelsea on Tuesday. \"If you look at the amount of games we've played in the last few weeks, the types of games that we have played and the attitude and the way they played it's top,\" Arteta added.  \"It's within them. They want to win, they want to compete at their best and their effort is unquestionable. The results are something but I'm really happy for the approach and the mentality of the team.\" Wolves' efforts were recognised positively by fans who stayed behind their team throughout - but when the season draws to a close, how much will they regret allowing Championship Coventry to overturn their injury-time lead in their FA Cup quarter-final at Molineux last month? A Wembley semi-final this weekend would have lifted a season that has turned into a grind for O'Neil's squad, who were superb for the first two-thirds of the campaign but now seem affected by a lack of energy and bodies. Joao Gomes forced David Raya to push his angled first-half effort on to a post and substitute Mario Lemina tested the Arsenal keeper with a second-half shot. But they were sporadic moments of attacking invention, with Wolves' best performers being defenders, particularly captain Max Kilman and Toti, who were outstanding at the heart of the home side's rearguard action. On-loan Tommy Doyle was industrious for Wolves. However, they have now gone six games without a win in all competitions, their longest run since the end of the 2021-22 season. Chairman Jeff Shi has repeatedly stated the club did not bring in reinforcements during the January window because he was not prepared to risk breaking the Premier League's profit and sustainability rules. However, the feeling will linger that the decision cost Wolves and O'Neil a realistic shot at a top half finish. Trossard has been in and out as an Arsenal player since joining from Brighton in a \u00a321m deal in January 2023. The Belgian has still made more substitute appearances than starts in the Premier League for the Gunners - and when things are not going well, he is an obvious candidate to be replaced. Yet he scores key goals. Since the beginning of last month alone, he has provided a winner against Porto in the Champions League, an equaliser in the home leg of the quarter-final with Bayern Munich, and now his latest effort - which takes him to 14 for the season in all competitions. Only Bukayo Saka has scored more for the Gunners. It was a scruffy effort, leaning back and on the stretch to get to Gabriel Jesus' prodded pass. But it floated right into the top corner, out of goalkeeper Jose Sa's reach. It changed the complexion of an evening that was starting to get a bit nervy for the visitors, who before that had allowed Wolves back into a game they had initially dominated. \"He's a little magician,\" said Arteta. \"He can score with any service. He's a big threat. So composed, so cool, he can play in different positions. It's just a joy to have him in the team.\" At the end of a tough week, it was understandable Arsenal were not at their free-flowing best. Still, they had chances. Kai Havertz swivelled neatly inside the area in both halves. However, on each occasion, the German sent his shot straight at Jose Sa. Declan Rice had four opportunities, including a first-half shot he sent fizzing just wide and an injury-time effort that forced Sa into a decent save. Yet, for all his obvious qualities, the England midfielder is yet to improve his goals output, something he is certainly capable of. It took Odegaard to finally finish Wolves off with a close-range effort in stoppage time.

        "text": " Last updated on 5 hours ago5 hours ago.From the section Footballcomments123 Maya le Tissier scrambled in a stoppage-time equaliser to deny Tottenham their first ever win over Manchester United in an enthralling dress rehearsal for next month's FA Cup final. Le Tissier, who signed a new contract this week, headed in from a packed goalmouth after Rachel Williams had hit the crossbar. Two goals in three minutes from Bethany England and Jessica Naz looked to have secured a momentous victory for Spurs after Melvine Malard had put United ahead at Leigh Sports Village. Centre-back Le Tissier's intervention briefly kept United's slim hopes of Champions League qualification alive - until Arsenal wrapped up a top-three finish by beating Leicester 3-0 at the Emirates. Malard headed in a deep free-kick from Gemma Evans to give United the lead before England was credited with the equaliser, although it was debatable whether she actually got a decisive touch to a shot across goal from Drew Spence. There was no doubt over the potency of Naz's strike though, as she cut inside a defender and lashed past Mary Earps. Tottenham manager Robert Vilahamn saw his side soak up concerted United pressure after the break, but goalkeeper Rebecca Spencer was largely untroubled until the final seconds. And with England goalkeeper Earps up for a corner, Le Tissier stole in to steal a point. Only Chelsea, Manchester City and Arsenal have won major honours in the English game since Liverpool won the WSL in 2014. United or Tottenham will end that run with a maiden FA Cup win on 12 May and if the showpiece occasion lives up to this game, it will be one to remember. Spurs will again be without the influential on-loan Grace Clinton at Wembley - as they were in Leigh - with the on-loan United playmaker ineligible. But January signing Matilda Vinberg stepped up in her place, playing a big part in both goals, and could shine again on the big stage.

        "text": " Last updated on 1 hour ago1 hour ago.From the section FA Cupcomments3055 Manchester United scraped into the FA Cup final on penalties despite throwing away a three-goal lead against Championship side Coventry in an epic semi-final at Wembley. In a very modern-day thriller, United came out on top in a penalty shootout they were losing at one stage.  A quite remarkable contest only got that far because Victor Torp's effort in injury time in extra time was ruled out for offside by video assistant referee Peter Bankes. But after Bradley Collins saved United's first kick, from Casemiro, Andre Onana denied Callum O'Hare, then unsettled Ben Sheaf with some verbal jousting - and the Coventry captain missed - allowing Rasmus Hojlund to win it. What the watching United co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe made of it would be interesting to know. Thirty-four years ago, Mark Robins' goalscoring heroics in the FA Cup kept Sir Alex Ferguson in a job. Who knows what damage Robins' Coventry side have done to Erik ten Hag's chances of keeping his? United thought they were cruising to a repeat of last season's final with neighbours Manchester City when they led 3-0 thanks to goals from Scott McTominay, Harry Maguire and Bruno Fernandes. But in front of Ratcliffe, who had completed the London Marathon earlier in the day, co-chairmen Joel and Avram Glazer and new technical director Jason Wilcox, United imploded and Coventry took full advantage. After Ellis Simms and O'Hare reduced the deficit, Haji Wright kept his nerve in stoppage time to score from the spot and send the game into extra time. For a brief moment, Torp allowed delirious Coventry fans to believe their team were coming back next month to try to emulate the Sky Blue heroes of their 1987 triumph over Tottenham. It was not to be. But when it was all over, it was the Championship players who were taking the acclaim of their fans as Ten Hag and his players rather sheepishly made their way to the dressing rooms. It is only the second time in the competition's history that the same two teams have reached successive finals. Blackburn Rovers beat Queen's Park at Kennington Oval in 1884 and 1885.  United will hope to prevent City enjoying similar success after a 13-second opener from Ilkay Gundogan paved the way for a Blues victory 12 months ago. The win keeps alive Ten Hag's hopes of lifting silverware in both his seasons as United manager. Yet the win just brings more questions for him. For an hour, United were dominant and in control, with Casemiro excelling in central defence. Then, not for the first time in recent weeks, they found the self-destruct button and hit it hard. Even for a team who led deep into stoppage time at Brentford and drew, and led deep into stoppage time at Chelsea and lost, this was a new low. And it all coincided with Alejandro Garnacho's departure. The Argentine wideman had to apologise for liking a couple of social media posts in the wake of the 2-2 draw at Bournemouth on 13 April, when he had been substituted amid Ten Hag's hints he was not quite fulfilling his role properly. Garnacho did not appear impressed to be replaced at Wembley either and walked slowly to the touchline, although he did at least acknowledge his manager on the way off. It can only be wondered what he was thinking about the carnage in front of him. Simms' first-time effort should have been nothing more than a consolation. Instead, United lost their shape, made rash decisions and found themselves exposed. O'Hare's goal required a huge slice of fortune but he was given too much time to shoot.  Aaron Wan-Bissaka was scurrying across the United box in a panic when he got his arm in the way of a cross that would have created a problem for his team anyway, but gave them an even bigger one as the contest went into extra time. This was a day Coventry fans will remember forever, not far behind the epic 1987 final victory. It was made all the more magical because of the pain the club have experienced in recent times, shunted into groundshares with Northampton and Birmingham amid a row with the club's ownership and their landlords. That trauma must have been in many minds as the players applauded their noisy and colourful support at the end. Whilst the United end was virtually empty, thousands of Coventry fans remained and cheered as defender Joel Latibeaudiere gave a TV interview. Robins is not given to displays of emotion and seemed quite calm at the end. But inside, he must be a mixture of pride and agony, knowing how close his side had come to being the first Championship team since Cardiff in 2008 to reach the final.

It may seem harsh but the brutal reality is that Chelsea and Pochettino came up short once more on the big occasion, the pain even more acute because again so many of their wounds were self-inflicted. Chelsea were left to regret a host of missed chances were they were undone by a youthful and injury-ravaged Liverpool in the Carabao Cup Final in February. And they had that \"what might have been\" feeling on repeat here after Bernardo Silva's late goal sent holders City into another FA Cup final. They will also tell a hard luck story after referee Michael Oliver's declined to award a penalty after the video assistant referee studied what looked like a handball by Jack Grealish from Cole Palmer's second-half free-kick before deciding no offence had been committed. Chelsea will also know they had enough chances to make those penalty claims irrelevant but, as against Liverpool, chances came and went - mainly because of misfiring striker Nicolas Jackson. When that happens you leave the door open to the ruthlessness of a great team, even if that great team is jaded and seemingly playing from muscle memory. That was the case with City were following their own gruelling efforts in the Champions League quarter-final loss on penalties to Real Madrid on Wednesday. But they took advantage of Chelsea's misses six minutes from time when Kevin de Bruyne's cross set up Silva for the winner at the far post. It was a redemptive moment for Silva after his casual chipped penalty, easily saved by keeper Andriy Lunin, played a key part in that Champions League exit. Pochettino is still pursuing a first trophy in England, another chance of silverware escaping him to maintain a record that places him in the category of very good managers but not a member of the elite group. He had Chelsea well-organised and motivated but the bottom line is that his team once again failed to win when it mattered, especially disappointing as they would then have felt quietly confident of victory in the final against either Coventry City or Manchester United on 18 May. Pochettino clearly felt Chelsea had been served up a huge injustice in that penalty incident but Jackson's wayward finishing kept City afloat when they seemed to be sinking under the weight of fatigue. Jackson is a smooth runner with pace but lacks a ruthless edge in front of goal when it matters, especially in the first half when he tried to go around City keeper Stefan Ortega rather then shoot, then when he allowed two more big openings to go to waste in the second half. This was the deciding factor. Yes, City showed the mentality of champions to stick in and win but the conditions were in place for Chelsea emerge victorious and they blew it again. It remains one of the huge flaws in the great scattergun, dysfunctional transfer spree embarked upon by Chelsea in the Todd Boehly era that none of this wild free-spending has homed in on a reliable striker. This is more than an oversight. It borders on negligence and, as against Liverpool, it haunted them against City. Wembley was once a happy hunting ground for Chelsea but it has turned into a nightmare in recent seasons, losing the 2019 League Cup final to Manchester City, the 2020 FA Cup final to Arsenal, the 2021 FA Cup final to Leicester City, the 2022 League and FA Cup finals to Liverpool on penalties after goalless draws, this season's League Cup final to Liverpool and now this. Chelsea have failed to score in five of their past six games at Wembley. In Pochettino's defence, there are signs that Chelsea are moving in the right direction but the record at the pressure points this season demonstrate that this is a work in progress for all the lavish building. Pochettino, if he is to fashion the finished product, will need time and patience. The big question is whether he will be afforded it. It was a tribute to City's pedigree and in-built resistance required by every elite team that they dug in long enough to deliver the semi-final's decisive moment but the lingering memory, a bad one, for Chelsea is that they let Pep Guardiola's team off the hook. City were short of their usual energy and quality, understandable given their exertions on Wednesday, Guardiola enraged by the fact they had to play their semi-final on Saturday while Manchester United and Coventry City, with no European commitments, play here on Sunday. City pulled it out because they have the proven track record of winners who know how to get the job done even when they are suffering. Chelsea and Pochettino have not. And the difference was there for all to see once more as City move into position for another domestic Premier League and FA Cup double."

        "text": " Last updated on 19 April 202419 April 2024.From the section Man Utd Manchester United's Alejandro Garnacho has apologised to Erik ten Hag for liking social media posts critical of his substitution against Bournemouth. The winger, 19, was removed at half-time during the 2-2 draw on 13 April. He has since unliked the posts and manager Ten Hag said that they are moving on from the incident.  \"Alejandro is a young player, he has to learn a lot,\" said Ten Hag. \"He apologised for it and after that we move on.\" United, who have not won in four Premier League matches, face Coventry in an FA Cup semi-final on Sunday. The social media posts on X criticised Ten Hag's handling of Garnacho, with one saying that he \"had a poor first half, but taking him off at half-time and holding him up as the problem is a joke\". It is not the first time that social media has caused issues for Ten Hag. In September 2023, Jadon Sancho posted on X that he was being made a \"scapegoat\" after being dropped by the manager. Ten Hag said that Sancho, who is now on loan at former club Borussia Dortmund, was dropped for poor performances in training, which the winger said was \"totally untrue\".  It led to a breakdown in the pair's relationship before Sancho's loan move, but Ten Hag praised the 24-year-old for his efforts in helping Dortmund beat Atletico Madrid to reach the Champions League semi-finals.  \"I follow international football and follow the players on loan at other clubs,\" said Ten Hag.  \"It was a fantastic game, and a great performance from Dortmund. For Jadon it's good news, he made his contribution to the result. \"No [nothing has changed about his future], but we know Jadon Sancho is a fantastic football player, so that is not a surprise for us, that is not the issue.\" "

        "text": " Last updated on 20 April 202420 April 2024.From the section Premier Leaguecomments386 Forward Yoane Wissa scored twice as Brentford made easy work of Luton to pull 10 points clear of the relegation zone. Wissa met Bryan Mbeumo's pass first time to curl in the opener emphatically from the edge of the box with 24 minutes on the clock. The DR Congo forward grabbed his second on the stroke of half-time, reacting quickest to a loose ball after Luton failed to deal with Mbeumo's low cross. Defender Ethan Pinnock, making his first start since 10 February, headed in a Sergio Reguilon corner in the 62nd minute to put the Bees firmly in the driving seat. Luton looked dejected and devoid of ideas when Keane Lewis-Potter was afforded space at the far post two minutes later, heading in Mbeumo's cross, before substitute Kevin Schade rounded off the scoring for the visitors. The home side rarely threatened but were gifted a chance in injury time when the ball fell to the feet of Luke Berry, who side-stepped goalkeeper Mark Flekken and finished from a tight angle. Brentford have climbed above Crystal Palace into 14th and are 10 points clear of the relegation zone with four games left to play, while Luton remain 18th and one point from safety. Chances were few and far between for Rob Edwards' side, who looked disjointed, and belief that they can secure a second successive season in the Premier League might be just starting to drain away. They have four games left to pull themselves out of the relegation zone but have won just one of their past 13 in the league, losing nine during that sequence, and have conceded 10 goals in their past two games. A lengthy injury list has to be taken into account, with nine senior players in the treatment room, but Luton have often put up a fight on home soil, something they failed to do against Brentford. Speaking to BBC Match of the Day, Edwards said: \"Brentford were very good and we were poor. They deserved to win the game. In spells in the first half, it looked a very even game. We had moments. It's all ifs buts and maybes. We didn't show enough, certainly in the second half. \"We're fighting for our lives to stay in the Premier League. It shouldn't be hard [to be motivated]. It's a tough day. \"Our supporters are incredible, I'm sorry they had to go through that. We owe them a performance now.\" Thomas Frank's side have become accustomed to playing without Ivan Toney, who was banned during the first half of the season for breaking FA betting rules, and they did not skip a beat without the injured England striker at Kenilworth Road. Wissa and Mbeumo formed an almost telepathic partnership in attack, with Lewis-Potter showing that he also has plenty to offer. In between Wissa's two well-taken goals, which saw him hit double figures in a league season for the first time since 2020-21 when he was in France with Lorient, Mbeumo crashed a shot off the crossbar. Lewis-Potter also caused problems in the first half, forcing goalkeeper Thomas Kaminski to claw the ball off the line before another goalbound effort was deflected behind by the head of defender Teden Mengi. The game was ended as a contest just after the hour mark when Pinnock and Lewis-Potter scored in the space of two minutes, while Schade's late strike demonstrated the strength Brentford have in reserve. It is the first time that the Bees have scored five goals in a league game since beating Leeds 5-2 in September 2022. With just 12 points left to play for, Brentford, who are 10 clear of the bottom three, can start to plan confidently for another season of Premier League football, having extended their unbeaten run to five games. Speaking to BBC Match of the Day, Frank said: \"We've finally got a bit of momentum. We had some very good performances recently, especially against Manchester United and Aston Villa. \"I respect Rob Edwards and his staff and they make it difficult for every team that comes here. We were very dominant and on top throughout the game.\" Player of the match CollinsNathan Collins 5.39 5.25 4.83 4.81 4.80 4.72 4.71 4.68 4.64 4.60 4.57 4.57 4.53 4.43 4.17 4.12 8.91 8.04 7.99 7.89 7.73 7.72 7.66 7.64 7.63 7.55 7.51 7.49 7.45 7.42 7.14 7.03 Formation  3-4-2-1 Formation  4-3-3 Match ends, Luton Town 1, Brentford 5.

        "text": " Last updated on 2 hours ago2 hours ago.From the section Scottish Cup Cyriel Dessers fired Rangers into a first Scottish Cup final against Celtic since 2002, with a goal either side of half-time at Hampden seeing off Hearts. The Nigeria international opened the scoring inside five minutes with a low left-footed shot under Craig Gordon, and his deflected effort made sure of the result late on after his initial shot was saved. Hearts had their moments in attack, but lacked the necessary quality and composure to breach a Rangers defence that had wobbled in recent weeks. Philippe Clement's side had won just two of their previous eight games in all competitions, but could yet win a domestic treble with the League Cup already secured. Clement made four changes to the side that drew at Dens Park in midweek, and Rangers could not have wished for a better start as they looked to end their recent malaise.  Dessers volleyed over Abdallah Sima's cross with his first chance of the game, but the Nigeria international made no mistake with his second sight of goal. Todd Cantwell found Dessers in the box after James Tavernier beat Kye Rowles to a loose ball, and the maligned striker chopped away from Nathaniel Atkinson onto his left foot before firing under Craig Gordon. Hearts looked somewhat overawed by the occasion, and struggled to retain possession under relentless pressure from a revived Rangers.  However, Naismith's side grew into the contest as the half went on.  Allan Forrest drew a sharp save from Jack Butland, before the Rangers goalkeeper brilliantly denied Frankie Kent with his legs, unaware the Hearts defender was offside. Rabbi Matondo then spurned a big chance to double Rangers' lead on the brink of half-time, dallying on the ball and allowing Atkinson to get back and block the shot. After the break, both sides found themselves in promising attacking positions but couldn't find the all-important final pass as tension grew on the pitch and in the stands.  For Hearts, Kenneth Vargas couldn't pick out the unmarked Forrest after pinching the ball from John Souttar, and Lawrence Shankland headed into the side netting with his clearest sight of goal on the day. At the other end, Dessers, Fabio Silva and Dujon Sterling all squandered chances, but as Hearts pressed for an equaliser, Rangers struck on the break to seal their final spot. Cantwell drove into the Hearts box, dancing past several defenders before releasing Dessers to his right.  Gordon could only parry the initial shot back into Dessers' path and the veteran keeper was unable keep out the rebound. The contrast between the two teams was stark. Rangers took the plaudits of the jubilant support behind the goal, while maroon jerseys slumped to the turf, knowing that their hopes of a fourth Scottish Cup final in six years were slipping away. Yutaro Oda did almost pull one back late on, but was denied by a sharp Butland save, while Silva missed a glorious chance to make it three, inexplicably falling on the ball with the goal at his mercy. Dessers scuffed an effort wide as he searched for a Hampden hat-trick, but his double was enough as Rangers continued their imperious record against Hearts. All season, Dessers has copped criticism from both pundits and Rangers fans alike, with questions raised particularly over his ability in front of goal.  However, he now has 19 goals in all competitions, and he came up with the goods when it mattered on the biggest of stages.  The good and bad of the Nigerian were both on show at Hampden. He picked up wonderful positions, roughed up opposition defenders, while also missing several chances alongside his two goals. Cantwell also deserves praise for the way he impacted the game. He constantly found pockets of space and set up both the goals. Naismith said the defeat highlighted Hearts' \"immaturity\", and he will be deeply frustrated by their profligacy on the day.  They have kept pace with Celtic and Rangers in terms of league points in the second half of this season, but have now lost all five of their meetings with Rangers this season.  It is a record Naismith will be determined to end as soon as possible. Rangers manager Philippe Clement: \"These last six months have been the best six months of Cyriel's career, and we'll keep pushing him on.  \"He's honest, he works really hard for the team. He's scoring a lot of goals. Can he make more goals? Yes, but I don't know any striker in the world who scores all their chances. \"We are in a title chase, we are in a cup final, and we are really hungry for more trophies.\" Hearts head coach Steven Naismith: \"It's really frustrating. Got off to a terrible start. It's not good enough. From that moment to the second goal, we played a lot of good stuff, created a lot of good chances. \"You could tell our immaturity in the final third, the decision making, the three, four, five good situations we were in, we never made the right choice. That's the part that let us down today. \"We can be really frustrated but the bigger picture is we've made big strides. It's decision making, that's the biggest thing that cost us today.\" Hearts are away to Kilmarnock in the league on 27 April (15:00), while Rangers go to Paisley in league action on 28 April (12:30).

        "text": " Last updated on 14 November 202314 November 2023.From the section Football Sign up for notifications to the latest Insight features via the BBC Sport app and find the most recent in the series. On a Saturday evening in February 1990, many of the United States' finest footballers stepped on to A&M Studios' historic soundstage in Los Angeles.  A month before John Barnes would implore his England team-mates to \"hold and give, but do it at the right time\" in a studio in Berkshire, the United States team recorded their own rap - one they hoped would make the sport famous at home.  In a moment, some of Hollywood's biggest celebrities would walk through the door to join them.  The plan was to record a novelty music video for a star-studded jock jam called Victory. The track celebrated the United States' first trip to the World Cup in 40 years, long before any of these players were born. Never mind fame, though. In 1990, making football a little less hated in the United States would have counted as a runaway success.  Americans mostly considered football a fringe concern - if they even considered it at all. Baseball, American football and basketball were the \"real\" American sports.  For most of the 20th century, football in the States was for \"the others\", to put it politely: expats, cab drivers, dishwashers, exchange students, leftists, intellectuals, Euro snobs and the like. Still the US Soccer Federation was constantly thinking about how to grow the game.  Werner Fricker, the federation's stern but visionary president, had cannily realised Fifa's desire to wring American dollars out of the world's most popular sport. By 1988, he had guided the United States to victory over Brazil and Morocco to win the right to stage the 1994 World Cup.  But Fricker knew a World Cup in the States faced scepticism. He wanted to prove the hosts had a team good enough to qualify on merit.  He put up his own money to fund a push to qualify for the 1990 event. If the United States succeeded it would be the first time they had made the World Cup since Brazil 1950, where they earned their place via a second-place finish in a three-team pool. \"Werner refused to accept that qualification wasn't doable,\" said Kevin Payne, former director of marketing and national administrator for the Federation. \"He knew what needed to be done, and that past attempts were amateurish.\" Fricker made Bob Gansler the team's first full-time coach. A tough yet erudite German-Hungarian immigrant, Gansler's knowledge of American youth football ran deep. The team picked by Gansler, many fresh out of college, had been raised during the North American Soccer League's Pele-led glory days and were a clean slate from past failures to reach the World Cup.  They had chips on their shoulders for all sorts of other reasons though.  Many of them were second-generation immigrants, their parents and family lives different from an 'apple pie' American ideal. They loved a sport that many around them reviled and yet there was no nationwide outdoor league for them to play in.  Instead, most of the squad either played the indoor game or on teams in the so-called ethnic leagues found in large cities.  Only three players had contracts in Europe.  The Federation decided to offer many of the rest small, centralised contracts so that they could train full-time. The result was a national team that was more like a club team, playing matches and ad-hoc tournaments against nearly any club or nation that would agree to them.  At the heart of it was the midfield duo of Tab Ramos and John Harkes, both raised on the hard, asphalt courts of Kearny, New Jersey. The forward line featured the industrious Peter Vermes and the physically imposing Bruce Murray, a big man with little-man ball skills. John Stollmeyer, seemingly carved out of granite, was the midfield enforcer while Mike Windischmann, a Germany-born, quiet kid from Queens and a former ball boy for the New York Cosmos, was sweeper and captain. Midway through qualifying, a 20-year-old friend of Ramos and Harkes from Kearny became the starting goalkeeper: Tony Meola. They didn't know it at the time, but this 1990 team would become the founding fathers of modern US football. \"None of us were alive in 1950,\" said defender Paul Krumpe. \"And since 1990, the US has put on such a good string of qualifying for every World Cup [except for 2018]. So this absolutely was the origin group.\" \"We used to get out of the bus and they'd throw bags of [urine] on us,\" Vermes said.  \"My first national-team game was in Guatemala in 1988 and I remember defending a corner kick and hearing 'ding! ding!' on the crossbar and post.  \"The crowd was throwing size D batteries at us. You would go take a corner kick and guys in the crowd would be spitting on you. It was crazy. It was a totally different time.\" The United States had to play three games in Central America during qualifying for the 1990 World Cup. Geopolitically, this was a complicated time to do so.  The Central Intelligence Agency and Department of Defense had been meddling in Central American countries for decades, and by the 1980s it was coming to a head. One of the teams in the United States' five-strong qualifying pool was El Salvador, a country in which the US had propped up a right-wing government in a long civil war that had claimed 70,000 lives and displaced more than one million people. Because of crowd trouble in El Salvador's previous World Cup qualifier, the United States' away match against the Salvadorians was staged in neighbouring Honduras, where the CIA was also active. The United States team bus was surrounded by commandos and equipped with a machine gun turret. It was similar when the United States played Guatemala, in the midst of a 30-year civil war started by a US-backed coup. There the team were shadowed by plainclothes bodyguards carrying tennis racquet cases, but perhaps not racquets.  Aside from the political backdrop, games in Central America were never easy. Fans hired bands to play outside the visitors' hotel rooms or lit fireworks. The US' designated practice pitch was hardly a pitch at all. The air conditioning mysteriously stopped working the night before the game.  Over seven months of matches, it all came down to the final tie - away to Trinidad and Tobago with the 24th and final spot in the 1990 World Cup at stake.  The United States needed a win yet hadn't scored a goal in their previous two games. Trinidad and Tobago, which would become the smallest nation to ever reach the World Cup, only needed a draw.  And their 'Strike Squad', as the team were known, hadn't lost at home in nearly two years.  All week in their dingy Florida training camp, the stakes rose even higher for the United States team. A rumour emerged that if the Americans didn't win this game and reach the World Cup, Fifa might take away their hosting rights for 1994.  That meant if they lost, there'd be no more football for them to play. What little existed of football in the US would disappear. Their contracts would be gone. They would all have to get day jobs. Some players were about to get married, others had purchased homes.  The United States team was used to fighting for every scrap of publicity they could at home, so nobody was prepared for a game of this magnitude. Stepping off the plane in Port of Spain at midnight, two days before the match, thousands of locals all dressed in red greeted the team on the tarmac, in the terminal, even on the roof of the airport singing, chanting, playing drums.  As the Americans drove to their hotel, locals three-deep lined the highway, dancing and singing a catchy calypso chant that continued all night long: \"T&T, we wanna goal!\" The Trinidad government had even declared the day after the match a national holiday. They were certain they were going to the World Cup. This was totally disorientating. The Americans had left their own, powerful country where football was the least important thing on earth and landed on a tiny island where it was the only thing on earth. It was obviously intimidating to be so outnumbered. But the tone wasn't savage - it was festive. The American team fed off it. Finally they had a big game of their own, just like in the movies.  All night before the game, local policemen had run their squad-car sirens outside the Americans' hotel windows. On the way to the stadium, the Americans' bus couldn't move. A crowd of 100,000 were outside the stadium and in the streets, all dressed in red. The Trinidad and Tobago Football Association had sold two tickets for every seat, and the scenes around the stadium were total chaos.  Gansler's pre-game talk wasn't emotional, it was typically straightforward: the American plan was to attack quickly themselves and pin their opponent back, frustrating both the home team and their crowd. They exited their dressing room with nerves like they've never felt before and lined up in the tunnel, looking into the white light ahead. Trinidad's players lined up alongside them, but something felt off. \"I remember looking at their guys and thinking to myself, 'they're not ready for this',\" Vermes said. \"You could see fear in their eyes. I knew right then we were winning. They were under so much pressure that they were scared.\" The stadium looked like a carnival. The pre-game festivities featured local pop stars, a military marching band, feathered dancers, a colour guard team and a fire engine driving around the field, hosing off the crowd.  The pitch, however, resembled a car park - dry and bumpy. It was hot and windy. The sun was so intense that players had trouble seeing. The first 20 minutes were nervy.  Eventually, Trinidad and Tobago began attacking in wave after wave, their speed and dribbling having pinned back the US. Then in the 32nd minute, from a United States throw-in, the ball found midfielder Paul Caligiuri. He prowled towards the goal, all the while trying to control a ball that wouldn't stop bouncing. He manoeuvred past one defender then - from 35 yards out and with no-one closing him down, the wind in his face and the sun at his back - the ball sat up perfectly. He lashed his foot across it and the ball sailed towards the goal in a high, looping arc.  \"I thought 'there's no way he's hitting this', but he just smacked it and the ball dipped like crazy,\" Harkes said. The goalkeeper's sight was blocked by his defenders and the sun was in his face. He made a late, weak leap to his side, but the ball plopped down on the other side of the goal line, past his glove.  After 239 minutes without a goal, Caligiuri - a defensive midfielder who was instructed not to attack, never mind shoot - had just scored the United States' biggest goal in decades, maybe ever. The crowd wasn't exactly silent - they were almost shrieking in horror. Trinidad had a few close chances in the second half but the United States dug deep and defended hard.  At the final whistle, the Americans collapsed on the ground in the golden late afternoon light. They'd done it. They had reached the World Cup when almost no-one expected them to, securing their own futures and that of the game in their homeland. \"There's no doubt that Gansler prepared us really well for tough moments,\" Vermes said. \"He knew we were going to have to survive tough moments. That's one of the biggest reasons why we won that game, because we had a tough mentality as a group.\" Their locker room was small, sweaty and full of Budweiser beer - one of the federation's biggest sponsors. The staff hadn't even purchased champagne beforehand. But soon, a trolley of bubbly appeared: it was Trinidad's. They certainly were not going to drink it now, and so it was magnanimously gifted to the Americans by Jack Warner, president of the Trinidad and Tobago Football Association.  On a handmade poster listing the 23 teams who qualified for the World Cup, Meola, the goalkeeper, wrote 'USA' into the final spot. As the team celebrated, Gansler, meanwhile, sat back and quietly took it all in. \"Bob was in the corner and, I'll never forget this, kept saying 'just another game' to everyone who congratulated him,\" said Murray. Yet the USA's first trip to the tournament in 40 years was hardly news at all back home. The game itself was shown on tape delay after an American football game, and only 432,000 people out of a population of 248 million watched it.  A few weeks later, at the glitzy World Cup draw in Rome, actress Sophia Loren pulled out the ping pong balls and passed them to Fifa secretary general Sepp Blatter. The United States would share a group with hosts Italy, who had won the World Cup seven years before, and two solid European sides in Czechoslovakia and Austria. The United States team may have been anonymous to most Americans, but they had a few friends in high places. One of them was Shelli Azoff, wife of music industry mogul Irving Azoff.  Two years before, Caligiuri had wangled an invitation to an exclusive party thrown for George Michael in the Hollywood hills. Among others there, he had met Shelli, who had known other footballers. She previously tried to help Caligiuri's UCLA team-mate David Vanole get a try-out at Watford, owned at the time by the Azoffs' friend Elton John.  Azoff instantly saw the potential for this team.  \"They all were good-looking. They were smart. They all were nice guys and represented the best of America, so I tried to get them some media attention,\" Azoff said. \"Especially for the United States, the underdog, to get into the World Cup for the first time in forever, I thought would be a great opportunity.\" They deserved to be famous. With some clever marketing, maybe they could be. Caligiuri had recently recorded a rap song with his college room-mate, a trained musician, for fun.  He played it for Azoff and she began calling in favours from music video directors, record label executives, MTV executives, producers and her celebrity friends. That night in February 1990 at A&M Studios, most of the team heard the new version of Caligiuri's song - rewritten and recorded by emerging hip-hop artist Def Jef - for the first time. It was now called Victory. Suddenly, star athletes and celebrities began walking through the door to join them, including American football's Marcus Allen, ice hockey's Luc Robitaille, TV star Cathy Lee Crosby and Nitro from American Gladiators.  OJ Simpson - the gridiron legend-turned-film star, whose subsequent arrest and acquittal on murder charges transfixed the world - was another of those to gather around the microphone with the players. \"These people just started popping up in the studio, it was like: 'We're in the big time, man!'\" said defender Desmond Armstrong. \"You just had to pinch yourself and say: 'Don't ask them for an autograph!'\" The next day, the team filmed additional scenes on Carbon Beach near the Azoff's Malibu home, stripping down to shorts to juggle a ball, horse around in the surf and approximate the 'running man' dance. \"Togetherness and unity means victory for you and me,\" rapped the squad over the top of the footage.external-link The video premiered that spring on MTV and other music video channels, but seldom afterwards. They had found a way to get football into the living rooms of America, but not even the celebrities of the era could help make it popular.  \"I think we thought we were going to ride a wave and people were going to follow us - but nobody cared,\" said Armstrong. As their bus pulled up outside their Italian training camp for the first time, it looked more like a military base to the United States players.  A high fence, crowned with barbed wire, surrounded the complex in Tirrenia, on the outskirts of Pisa. It was an old Olympic training facility that looked like it hadn't been used for many Olympics. The living quarters were like barracks. The eating area looked like a prison canteen. The menu seemed to consist entirely of pasta.  At least the training pitch was nice.  Tirrenia had been recommended to them by Italy's World Cup host committee as the only suitable and available training base anywhere near Tuscany. To a hungry American team overjoyed to finally reach the World Cup, staying here felt like punishment. Before their first game, against Czechoslovakia, Gansler ratcheted up the training intensity. In this setting, it felt like they were preparing for war.  Their first game, though, ended in disaster. After the United States looked lively and dangerous for the opening 20 minutes, Czechoslovakia realised how naive their opposition's tactics were - reliant on man-marking - and pulled them all out of position.  Forward Eric Wynalda, a day after his 21st birthday, was baited into a red card early in the second half.  Caligiuri scored a sensational goal on a 60-yard run, starting in his own half, but it was mostly forgotten as Czechoslovakia ran out 5-1 winners. After 40 years away from the World Cup, the next morning's headlines were not kind to the Americans. \"USA: What a Delusion,\" wrote Corriere della Sera. Gazzetta dello Sport noted the \"century of difference\" between the United States and Czechoslovakia. The Times explained that the US \"were utterly exposed by such Bronze Age devices as an overlapping full-back\". Next up was Italy, in Rome. The Americans had three days to pull themselves together. \"There were a lot of deep thoughts among the players,\" Harkes told the Guardian of the build-up.external-link \"'Are we really up for this?'\" Practices got even more intense. The second-string players were upset at having to mimic their opponents in order to train the starters - who had played badly and perhaps didn't deserve to keep their starting spot.  One afternoon, a fight broke out. Forwards Bruce Murray and Eric Eichmann, former college team-mates, traded punches as they got tangled up in the goal net. The squad quickly rushed in and broke it up. Then, oddly, everyone started laughing. A pressure valve had released. Now they could focus on their next opponent, not their last.  Behind his sunglasses it was impossible to know what Gansler made of this melee. Most players assumed he was pleased to see some fight in his boys, even if it was literal.  Before the Italy game, the worldwide press genuinely debated whether the United States would lose by 10 goals or more. Italy's press pack were cheerfully predicting a goleada, meaning a rout. After the Azzurri won their first game 1-0 against Austria, a slaughter of the United States would be the main course for the expectant host nation.  No-one gave the United States any chance at salvaging their dignity, never mind getting a result. After all, the Azzurri were stacked with such legends as Walter Zenga, Franco Baresi, Paolo Maldini, Gianluca Vialli, Roberto Donadoni and Roberto Baggio. Many of the United States players were playing for a few hundred bucks on weekends in short-lived regional football leagues in front of a few hundred spectators. The day before the match, the United States drove to Rome. Everyone on the street who saw the team bus drive past held up two hands. Inside the bus, Armstrong waved back at them with one hand. Finally, their translator spoke up. \"You know what they're saying, don't you?\" he said to Armstrong. \"No man, what?\" \"They're saying you're going to lose by 10 goals, and you're telling them you're only going to lose by five.\" Pope John Paul II - a former goalkeeper - moved the day's Corpus Domini parade forward one hour so that Italians wouldn't miss a single goal. The whole nation - and possibly the heavens - was against the Americans. Just as in Trinidad, they were under siege: 73,000 people in the stadium were expecting a bloodbath.  When both teams lined up in the tunnel, Donadoni encouraged American defender John Doyle, at the front of the United States' line, to walk out first. Doyle naively thought this was a nice gesture and led his team out on to the pitch. A deafening number of boos and whistles cascaded down from the stands. It was a trick. Then a few seconds later, the terrible din turned to roaring as the Azzurri took to the pitch.  This was a far bigger crowd than this United States team had ever played before. But Gansler, as usual, had a plan. Rather than always trying for a quick counter-attack whenever they got possession, the United States would attempt to slow the game down. Keep possession, he told his team. It would frustrate the Italians and their expectant fans.  The first few minutes were nervy: cautious attacking, physical defending. Then in the 11th minute, Italy sliced through the American defence in a devastating four-pass, five-player sequence to make it 1-0. It was so fast the United States didn't know what hit them. It seemed the goleada was on. But the Americans dug in. In one first-half passage of play, they kept the ball away from Italy for what seemed like minutes. Whenever the United States had the ball the crowd would whistle, but having it this long, the whistling was almost feverish. The Azzurri could not get the ball off the Americans, and the Stadio Olimpico atmosphere became savage. The crowd was turning against its own team. Gansler's plan was working. But then in the 33rd minute, Italy won a penalty. The crowd vibrated once again with anticipation, but Vialli hit the post. In the way that missed opportunities can change matches, the first half finished limply. At half-time, the United States felt good. Everyone stressed that they needed to keep playing their game and remain patient, a chance would come.  The second half was more of the same: nervy, technical play with missed chances. Then around the 70th minute, Italy defender Riccardo Ferri elbowed forward Murray in the face. Murray 'thanked' him, Ferri replied in kind, expletives overcoming the language barrier. Was this the United States' chance? The free-kick was 25 yards out. Murray ran on to it and hit it so hard he nearly fell over. Zenga could only parry it into the path of Vermes. Vermes saw Zenga spring back to his feet and shot hard and low, straight between the keeper's legs. It was perfectly struck - but hit Zenga's buttocks as he fell backwards, taking the fizz off the shot. All the noise in the stadium disappeared as the ball rolled slowly towards the open goal. Two American players rushed to tap home an equaliser, but they were beaten there by Ferri who rescued his team from a problem of his own making, blasting the ball clear and far upfield. Italy created a few more chances, one expertly saved by Tony Meola. But, when the final whistle blew and the game ended, the scoreline was not 10-0 but 1-0. The crowd initially booed and whistled as hard as they could.  Soon, though, that noise turned to cheers as spectators realised what they had witnessed: Italy's superstars had given their all on the field, not to embarrass the United States, but to avoid being embarrassed. The Americans had lost, but felt strangely buoyant. Harkes tried to exchange shirts with Ferri. Ferri explained he'd already promised his shirt to someone else, then took his shorts off and handed them to Harkes.  \"'This is odd but\u2026 OK',\" Harkes thought as he handed his shorts to Ferri and exited the pitch in his underwear.  When the Americans reached their dressing room, they felt vindicated in the eyes of the world. As Steve Trittschuh, an unused substitute, reached the dressing room last, he saw a silhouette approaching their door too. It was another unused substitute, this one short and with a braided ponytail. It was Baggio, recently anointed as the world's most expensive player after an \u00a38m move to Juventus. He had come to trade for some American shorts. Once all were inside the dressing room, the Americans heard a knock. In stepped Baresi, Maldini, Baggio and team-mate Fernando de Napoli. One of them said to the Americans: \"We want you to know that your country should be proud of you.\"  Just 90 minutes before, the Americans were the laughing stock of the football world, yet here were the Azzurri's biggest stars congratulating them personally.  The Italian stars then chatted for a while in the US dressing room, rehashing the game with their American counterparts through their interpreter and exchanging laughter. After the Azzurri players departed, there was another knock on the door. It was retired boxing legend 'Marvelous' Marvin Hagler, who had moved to Italy and was starring in Rambo-style action B-movies. The players couldn't believe it. \"I just want to say that you guys were great out there tonight,\" Hagler said. \"You made me proud.\" This was quite a moment. The Americans were used to the rest of the world loving football, but praise from a sports superstar whom they all admired felt significant. It reminded them of what they had truly accomplished in reaching the World Cup.  Now that Hagler lived outside the United States, he understood. Maybe someday the rest of the country would, too. The United States lost their third game, a bad-tempered, card-filled match against Austria, and finished in last place in their group. Their first World Cup in 40 years was over after three eventful matches.  But their 1990 adventure was an essential first step back into World Cup football in which they learned what to expect, how to prepare, where to stay and how to play at the highest level before hosting the tournament four years later. Before the World Cup, only three Americans were playing in Europe. Within the next year, 10 members of the team had signed contracts with European or South American clubs, including Harkes, who became the first American to play in the Premier League, with Sheffield Wednesday, Murray and Kasey Keller at Millwall and Meola at Brighton & Hove Albion.  Even the off-field connections they made continued to bear fruit. Two years later, Shelli Azoff met a sports attorney on a flight, and in 1996 they helped establish the US national team players' union.  \"I played on better teams,\" said Tab Ramos,external-link a veteran of three World Cups. \"But I have to say, the 1990 team is the most important. That '90 team was just different. It was special and had different personalities, and it really set the tone at a time when we really needed it.\" It's impossible to imagine football's steady growth in the USA without the exploits of the 1990 team.  Their slog through Central America, their heroics in Trinidad and their redemption in Rome is the story of a bunch of players fighting not for fame - although that would have been nice - but simply the chance to keep playing football for a living, and to give the sport a shot in America. Adam Elder is the author of New Kids in the World Cup - the story of the team 'that changed American soccer forever'"

        "text": " Last updated on 20 April 202420 April 2024.From the section Premier Leaguecomments419 Burnley gave their Premier League survival hopes a huge boost with a vital victory to push bottom side Sheffield United further towards relegation. A must-win game for both sides went the way of Vincent Kompany's men as clinical finishing allowed them to move just three points off safety, while Chris Wilder's side are now 10 points adrift. The Clarets were second best for much of the first half with Arijanet Muric making crucial saves to keep his side in the contest, before they scored twice in the space of three minutes. On-loan Jacob Bruun Larsen broke the deadlock on 38 minutes when his scuffed volley took a deflection and wrong-footed goalkeeper Ivo Grbic to dribble in at the near post. In the next attack Burnley doubled their advantage courtesy of full-back Lorenz Assignon weaving through and poking home via Grbic's outstretched leg and the crossbar. Muric made an outstanding save to deny James McAtee's strike which was bound for the top corner, but he could do nothing about Gustavo Hamer cutting inside and curling in a sumptuous finish to give Sheffield United hope. But the visitors restored their two-goal advantage following Lyle Foster's tidy, first-time finish from Assignon's cross and substitute Johann Berg Gudmundsson added a delightful fourth for a thumping triumph. Burnley won the reverse fixture 5-0 in December, spelling the end of Paul Heckingbottom's tenure as Sheffield United manager, and this damaging defeat looks close to being their top-flight demise. Both sides came up from the Championship last season and Kompany called the jump into the Premier League the \"biggest in world football\" but his team have given themselves a fighting chance to preserving their status with four games remaining. This was just their second win in the past 16 league games and they will be watching Sunday's game at Goodison Park closely, as an Everton win will allow Burnley to remain in touch with 17th-placed Nottingham Forest. But it could have been such a different story at Bramall Lane had the hosts not come up against an inspired Muric, who made amends after costly errors in the past two games against Brighton and the Toffees. The Kosovo international stayed big to make a crucial stop to deny Oli McBurnie from close range early on and he made a fingertip stop from the home striker's thumping drive. The Burnley stopper also denied Brereton Diaz on a number of occasions, a header, a one-on-one effort and a low drive towards the near post. Sheffield United missed their chances and were made to pay - Grbic did not cover himself in glory as he was slow to react to Larsen's goal and Assignon's shot bobbled in but he could do nothing about cool finishes from Foster and Gudmundsson. The away side should have made it an even more handsome scoreline but Josh Brownhill's lofted effort from long range sailed wide while Gudmundsson smacked the post with a well-struck volley.

        "text": " Last updated on 20 April 202420 April 2024.From the section FA Cupcomments2361 Manchester City bounced back from the disappointment of the Champions League quarter-final exit to Real Madrid as Bernardo Silva's late goal sunk Chelsea at Wembley to seal a place in the FA Cup final. It was redemption for Silva after his poor spot-kick played a key role in City's loss on penalties to Real. The Portuguese midfielder turned in the winner at the far post from Kevin de Bruyne's cross six minutes from time. Chelsea will regret missing a host of chances, nearly all falling to striker Nicolas Jackson, as they suffered another agonising Wembley experience after the extra-time defeat on penalties against Liverpool in the Carabao Cup final. And Chelsea also feel they were victims of an injustice as they were infuriated that they were not awarded a second-half penalty when Cole Palmer's free-kick struck Jack Grealish's hand in the wall, only for the video assistant referee to rule no offence had taken place. City remain on course for another double of Premier League and FA Cup and will now face either arch-rivals Manchester United or Championship side Coventry City in the final. City manager Pep Guardiola asked his side, who suffered such bitter disappointed as their hold on the Champions League trophy was wrestled away by Spanish giants Real, to go to the well once more against a highly-motivated Chelsea in the FA Cup semi-final at Wembley. And, at times, it looked like the quest for victory might be beyond them as they looked jaded and leggy, only for their pedigree and muscle memory keeping them in contention until they could shake off the lethargy. City did not even have a shot on target in the first half but slowly came into the game before, as the great sides do, they found a way to win. The holders are always capable of moments of quality and it was no surprise that it was De Bruyne who unlocked Chelsea when they switched off fatally late on, the Belgian picking out Silva at the far post for the winner. And it was a sweet moment for Silva, who chose to loft a dreadful penalty straight at Real keeper Andriy Lunin in a decisive moment in the shootout against Real as City's attempt to win a second Champions League failed. Here, as he has done so often, the Portuguese arrived with perfect timing to send City into another FA Cup Final. City will be exhausted after another mammoth effort but will be refreshed for battles ahead by a hugely significant victory. Chelsea and manager Mauricio Pochettino left Wembley with that \"what might have been\" feeling once again after seeing a golden chance to reach the FA Cup final pass them by.  Pochettino set his team up ideally to keep City at bay but once again, as they did in that Carabao Cup final loss to Liverpool, Chelsea were their own worst enemies as they squandered opportunities to banish memories of that reverse. And striker Jackson was the biggest culprit, deciding to go around City keeper Stefan Ortega when put clean through in the first half, failing to complete the job. Jackson also shot low and tamely for Ortega to save in the second half, then saw a header clawed out by the keeper seconds later when the striker should have done better. Chelsea will argue long and hard that they should have been awarded the penalty for what they felt was handball by Grealish from Palmer's free-kick but it was all to no avail. Palmer, Chelsea's big hope, had a quiet game against his former club and Chelsea must focus on making a late run for a place in Europe as their trophy hopes were ended.

        "text": " Last updated on 18 April 202418 April 2024.From the section West Ham West Ham boss David Moyes was involved in a frosty exchange with a reporter as he was asked about his future at the club following their Europa League exit. Moyes' contract is set to expire at the end of the season and there has been no clarity on whether he will sign an extension. West Ham went out of the competition to Bayer Leverkusen 3-1 on aggregate after drawing the second leg of their quarter-final 1-1 at London Stadium. After the match, Moyes and the media officer who accompanied him took exception to a question asked at a news conference. Here is how the exchange unfolded... Reporter: \"If this is the end of your tenure at the end of the season, how do you reflect on...\" Moyes: \"Sorry, I didn't get that question.\" Media officer: \"We are not focusing on the end of tenures.\" Moyes: \"We have just played in a third quarter-final there.\" Reporter: \"I was reflecting on the three years you have had in Europe and the moments you have given these fans...\" Moyes: \"Better question. We have been in three quarter-finals, won two and were narrowly close tonight. The supporters have been treated to big nights against Alkmaar and Sevilla. Leverkusen are a Champions League team and play that way. We have three fabulous years and we are hoping we can make it four.\" Moyes has been in the game too long not to realise questions will keep being asked about his future until a decision is made. He is also aware some West Ham fans would prefer he left the club, largely because of what they perceive to be negative tactics, even though he has delivered the best series of sustained results for over a generation. Moyes' side are eighth in the Premier League, and will almost certainly need to climb to seventh to secure European football for a fourth successive season. That will not be easy considering they have played more matches than all the teams around them and their final five opponents include Liverpool, Chelsea and Manchester City. On a night when new German champions Bayer Leverkusen needed a late goal to prevent West Ham inflicting their first defeat of the entire season, coach Xabi Alonso said the only positive from an awful first half for them was that their two-goal first-leg lead had not been wiped out completely. Moyes, who felt his side should have been further ahead at half-time, was vexed by the performance of the Spanish referee Jose Maria Sanchez Martinez. The West Ham manager, though, was uncomfortable being asked to articulate a view he felt many of the media present would agree with. \"I will turn the question round and ask you what you thought about the officiating,\" he said. When the questioner changed the subject, Moyes replied: \"I am asking you.\" Upon being told \"the fans\" weren't impressed, Moyes asked: \"Are you a fan or just reporting?\" He later remarked: \"He knows it was [a] very poor [question] but he wanted me to say it.\" However, Moyes did concede: \"I have managed in Spain and have watched a lot of Spanish football. If that is how it is, I wouldn't be watching too many Spanish games.\""

        "text": " Last updated on 4 hours ago4 hours ago.From the section Scottish Cup Celtic eventually prevailed on penalties after a six-goal Hampden classic as the holders progressed to their 60th Scottish Cup final and left Aberdeen heartbroken. In a high-quality shootout Joe Hart had the chance to win it with the fifth penalty for Celtic, after Ryan Duncan's effort hit the post, but the goalkeeper too struck the woodwork. However, Hart made amends by saving Killian Phillips' effort and Celtic will now face either Hearts or Rangers next month as they look to lift the oldest trophy in football for a record-extending 42nd time.  The incredible finale was befitting of an epic tie in which Aberdeen twice scored last-gasp levellers. Angus MacDonald's 119th-minute header appeared to have completed a remarkable redemption arc after the stand-in captain's howler gifted Celtic's equaliser to Nicolas Kuhn in the first half. Aberdeen - led by interim manager Peter Leven - had taken a surprise lead after two minutes when Bojan Miovski capitalised on a sleeping defence. Celtic were much improved in the second half and substitute James Forrest thought his curled finish had booked their spot in the final in normal time, but Ester Sokler's dramatic header in the 90th minute forced extra time. Matt O'Riley's composed rocket restored Celtic's lead but there was plenty more drama to come before the astonishing tie was finally settled and Brendan Rodgers' unbeaten Hampden record continued. The pre-match chat was dictated by how Aberdeen would stop Celtic. Don't allow the league leaders to control. Don't allow them to score early. Aberdeen did that, and gave them a taste of their medicine.  Leighton Clarkson, deployed slightly higher in the Aberdeen attack, wiped the Celtic defence out in one delicious attack, and Miovski curled the ball around Hart to shock the green and white hordes in the Hampden sun.  Kyogo stung Kelle Roos' palms in response before the calamitous equaliser came. Much was made of captain Graeme Shinnie's absence, with MacDonald donning the armband in his place. There was no calmness on show when the ball got stuck beneath his feet and Kyogo robbed it. Stefan Gartenmann slid in to deny the Japan international a shot of his own, but it acted as the perfect lay-off for Kuhn to roll into an unguarded net. Gartenmann was one brilliant block away from restoring Aberdeen's lead as Clarkson's free-kick deceived all and was met by the Dane at the back post, but Hart rushed out to save. In a stop-start first half, VAR mulled over a Liam Scales handball, but judged the incident to be outside of the box. There was a feeling Celtic would not be so far off it after the break and, indeed, they looked much more menacing. Despite only being on the pitch a matter of moments, Forrest sent a powerful warning shot before his precise goal tucked into the bottom corner beneath Roos. It seemed that goal would prove the difference as Celtic were in cruise control, but Aberdeen's substitutes prompted a late rally. Junior Hoilett fluffed his lines on a frantic counter-attack before Cameron Carter-Vickers incredibly denied him with a goalline block.  However, the Canada international got his angles all right to tee up Sokler in the 89th minute for just his third goal in red to send the tie into extra time.  O'Riley had been quiet by the high standards he's set this season, but when presented with a moment to shine, he slammed into the top corner. Aberdeen once more believed they had a shot at restoring parity when Hoilett hit the deck in the box and referee Don Robertson seemed to point to the spot. After mass confusion, no penalty was awarded as VAR spotted a foul in the build-up on Alistair Johnston. But Aberdeen were not down and out, yet. MacDonald towered at a crowded back post to head down deep in extra time and force penalties.  It proved to be a stretch to far, though. On-loan Crystal Palace midfielder Phillips was the unfortunate player to miss at the crucial moment in a shootout dominated by Hart's confidence and ultimate contribution. Wow. What a game. One that will be talked about for decades. An astonishing affair from start to end.  Miovski's magnificent opener feels as long ago as last season. The North Macedonia forward was much missed late in the day after he hirpled off, as he had Carter-Vickers in a spin.  The Dons were a thorn in Celtic's side. They did not quit. That's perhaps one of the most telling takeaways from a storied day. There was a fight and hunger in Leven's side that has not always been there throughout the campaign. Maybe if it had been, they wouldn't now only be focusing on their bottom-six games to come.  Rodgers said recently this is the part of the season where Celtic come alive. It took them a while to appear awake but ultimately they were wide-eyed when it mattered.  A gruelling afternoon for a side still in the hunt for the league and cup double, and it was the old guard yet again who turned up trumps. Hart turned 37 on Friday. He could have scored the decisive penalty at Hampden, instead he made the pivotal save. The introduction of Forrest was also key. It's now eight goals and 10 assists now against Aberdeen. Thirteen goals for Celtic at the national stadium. He's bearing down on matching Billy McNeill's trophy tally with the club too.  Rodgers said he is still Celtic's best winger. Moments of magic like he produced here proved he can still deliver on the big stage. Aberdeen interim manager Peter Leven: \"I thought the boys gave everything. It's a sickener at the end - penalties are a bit of a lottery - but we went toe-to-toe at times with Celtic. \"We had two academy graduates stepping up taking penalties - I'm proud of them as well. I thought they gave everything, I've said to them that's the benchmark to end the season.\" Celtic manager Brendan Rodgers: \"What a game for neutrals watching, but great spirit and credit both teams. I need a therapy session. Aberdeen did fantastic, nothing to lose and came and played really well. \"We weren't tight enough in our positioning and they were quite bright in midfield and combined well to get through.\" Formation  4-2-3-1 Formation  4-3-3 Match ends, Aberdeen 3(5), Celtic 3(6).

        "text": " Last updated on 9 minutes ago9 minutes ago.From the section Scottish Cup Cyriel Dessers has spent much of his time as a Rangers player on the back foot. He's been criticised for the chances he misses rather than the ones he takes, questioned about his lack of of a ruthless side with many in the club's support bemoaning the fact that their board didn't move for Lawrence Shankland in January. Is Dessers aware of the mood music around him?  You bet he is. How could he not be? Is he showing mental strength in the face of the doubters? Unquestionably. \"A beautiful day,\" he said, later. \"It feels special.\" Maybe the big man got a bit carried away after that when asked about the league title race. Buoyed by his Hampden goals he said that if Rangers can get their \"rhythm\" back then \"we are the best team in the league.\" Oh dear.  Normally when you hear that kind from the blue side of the city then bad things normally follow. But he's said it now and needs to back it up.  More days like this would help. The smile on Dessers face at the end of this Scottish Cup semi-final was the smile of a man whose goals had put his team in the final and, perhaps, silenced a few folk.  Not permanently, but for now, until next time. Such is the way of it in Glasgow.  Winston Churchill is not necessarily the first person you think of when you watch Dessers playing football, but a famous quote from the former prime minister could be applied to the Rangers striker.  \"A riddle wrapped in a mystery inside an enigma,\" said Churchill of world affairs back in the day.  You could say the same about a striker whose numbers this season for Rangers have been excellent, rising to 18 and then 19 in this match-winning effort, but still he's the butt of much flak, a bit of a fall guy, a figure of frustration.  If you looked at the bare numbers of Dessers' time with Rangers, you could only conclude that this guy is one of the most prolific strikers the club has had in the last 20 seasons.  Taking out their years in the lower leagues - where goals were a whole lot easier to come by - his tally is only bettered by the single-season totals of Alfredo Morelos, Kenny Miller, Kris Boyd, Nacho Novo and Dado Prso over the last two decades.  With six games left to play - five in the league and the cup final against Celtic - he's already scored more goals than Antonio Colak, Kemar Roofe and Jermain Defoe ever did in one season.  Over the past 20 years, he's outscored Daniel Cousins and Jean-Claude Darcheville, Peter Lovenkrands, Shota Arveladze and Michael Mols and many other Rangers strikers in that timeframe. Nobody is saying that Dessers is the second coming of Ally McCoist, but he only needs one more to move ahead of the best season Nikica Jelavic ever had at Ibrox.  Jelavic only had one full one, but Dessers has matched him so far. His numbers defy some of the evidence of our own eyes.      We saw both sides of Dessers' ability at Hampden, the tidy footwork and calm finish for his first goal, then the clumsiness when getting into space to the left of the Hearts goal only to get the ball caught up in his feet much later on. That was down the Rangers end and they let him have it. Not fury, but a lot of angst. A plaintive cry of the masses.  That emotion didn't last long, of course. His second was down to Todd Cantwell's excellent run in the first instance and his own alertness in following up his first effort, beaten away by Craig Gordon, by putting away his second. That was the clincher, but there could have been more. Two goals to his name, you have to wonder why he didn't back himself for a third when he went through with Gordon at his mercy. His manager, Philippe Clement, thought the same.  Selflessly, he squared it to Fabio Silva and had Silva scored a simple tap-in, Dessers would have been praised for his awareness and for putting team success above individual glory.  Silva didn't score, though. In collapsing to the floor, Silva looked like an octopus falling out of a tree. Somewhere out there, Peter van Vossen was celebrating. No longer the holder of the greatest missed sitter award.   Before the end, Dessers had another chance, which he pushed wide of Gordon's right-hand post.  It wasn't straightforward and it wasn't costly, not on Sunday. He had his work done by then, he had his reputation enhanced and his confidence boosted.  The Nigerian is a one-man drama, his attempts on goal leaving you in suspense all the while.  Against Hearts, when it counted, he put it all together and won the praise of a manager who desperately needed this victory.  From the despair of the loss to Ross County and the despond of the draw in Dundee, this was a step in the right direction, a win that will take them back here for a cup final against Celtic.  Clement doesn't often show his emotions but after tough times recently he was a relieved man that Dessers delivered. "

        "text": " Last updated on 20 April 202420 April 2024.From the section Women's Footballcomments35 Bristol City are on the cusp of relegation from the Women's Super League after suffering a narrow defeat by Liverpool. The Vixens are seven points adrift of safety with three matches left. They have played a game more than second-bottom West Ham, who will send them down if they beat Manchester City on Sunday. Marie Hobinger scored the game's only goal on 13 minutes when she sent a low drive into the bottom corner. The goal came after the Austria international picked up a mistimed clearance on the edge of the box. On her side's WSL fate hanging on tomorrow's game, boss Lauren Smith told BBC Radio Bristol: \"I'll keep me eye on it but you can't do a lot about it. It's completely in someone else's hands and that's where we've left it. \"There's nothing we can do, we've just got to react to what comes of that and go into training on Monday ready for Manchester City next week.\" Liverpool move a point ahead of Manchester United and up to fourth with victory, although they will drop back down to fifth on Sunday if United avoid defeat against Tottenham. The visitors had earlier come close to scoring when Bristol City managed to clear the ball off the line, after a Shae Yanez clearance rebounded off Sophie Roman Haug. Liverpool nearly doubled their advantage when Haug tapped home after Yanez dropped a catch, but the referee deemed the Liverpool striker to have fouled Yanez. Bristol City soon had a similar chance when Teagan Micah spilled the ball after being pushed by Rachel Furness, but City did not convert the chance anyway before the free-kick was awarded. City were determined in attack as they tried to find a way back into a realistically must-win game, but they struggled to fashion any chances of real quality. They were given freedom to run at the Liverpool defence but were unable to break them down, and did not test Micah until she parried away an Amalie Thestrup effort in the second half - when the striker intercepted a loose pass. Hobinger nearly doubled Liverpool's lead but saw her long-range strike tipped on to the post by City keeper Yanez. Bristol City's energy fizzled out and Liverpool took control of the game, with Mia Enderby and Missy Bo Kearns both forcing Yanez to make late saves.

        "text": " Last updated on 30 January 202430 January 2024.From the section European Football Sign up for notifications to the latest Insight features via the BBC Sport app and find the most recent in the series here. A decision in time sends history down two very different tracks. In 1998, a Hollywood film starring Gwyneth Paltrow catapulted the term 'Sliding Doors' into popular lexicon. Ten years later, football had its own Sliding Doors moment. In the summer of 2008, Barcelona - managed by Frank Rijkaard - were a club stalled and set to fall.  A second trophyless season in succession had ended with Barca third in La Liga and suffering ignominy at the Bernabeu. With Real Madrid confirmed as champions in the days before, Barcelona had to give their arch-rivals a guard of honour on to the pitch before their league meeting. The embarrassment didn't stop there. A 4-1 thrashing followed, with the Madrid fans chanting \"Laporta please stay!\" to Barca's under-pressure president Joan Laporta.  Off the pitch, dressing-room ringleader Ronaldinho was spending more time in the city's nightclubs than banging in goals. Team discipline seemed to have drained away, with stories of the Brazilian being left to get his head down and sleep off the night's excesses rather than knuckle down in training. Questions over Ronaldinho's weight gain, and penchant for a night out, peppered the front and back pages of Barcelona's newspapers while in press conferences, every question directed at Rijkaard included the word \"resign\". With the Madrid fans' catcalls still ringing in his ears, Laporta provided his own answer.  Less than 24 hours after the embarrassment in Madrid, Rijkaard was sacked.  Who would replace him?  Top of the billing, and top of the list for any football pragmatist, was Jose Mourinho.  Mourinho had a positive historical relationship with the club as assistant to previous managers Bobby Robson and Louis van Gaal.  He also had a CV surpassing anyone else in Europe at the time, following Uefa Cup and Champions League triumphs with Porto, and successive and unprecedented Premier League titles with Chelsea. But, rather than opt for the A-list football celebrity, Barcelona opted for someone from the B-list. Literally. They chose their own B team manager, who was entirely unproven at the top level, and had spent the previous campaign - his first as a boss - in Spain's fourth tier and a Catalan regional division.  The decision?  Guardiola over Mourinho.  To understand why, and to get to the bottom of that decision that changed football, you have to dig deep into Barcelona DNA's where poetry, not pragmatism, is the primary motivator and one man's methods, opinions and gut instinct trump everything. As the new BBC Sport documentary Pep Guardiola: Chasing Perfection explores, to understand Pep, you have to understand Johan Cruyff.  Cruyff is synonymous with Barcelona, winning La Liga in 1974 and the Copa del Rey in 1978 as a player, before lifting four consecutive Spanish top-flight titles, and the European Cup, as the club's manager between 1988 and 1996. And Cruyff wielded an incredible influence over Guardiola's career. It was Cruyff who plucked a 19-year-old Guardiola from the Barcelona reserves in 1990 and catapulted him into an all-conquering first team full of global stars such as Michael Laudrup to Ronald Koeman. Cruyff saw in the teenage Guardiola a quality that endures. Spanish journalist Lu Martin knows Guardiola better than most, having ghost-written his little-known 2001 book La Meva Gent, El Meu Futbol (My People, My Football in Catalan). \"In Catalonia, we say 'seny' and 'rauxa'. [Legendary Barcelona captain Carles] Puyol has 'rauxa' - impulse, drive,\" Martin says.  \"The 'seny' - the brains - at FC Barcelona was Pep.  \"Pep brought sense to the team - because Pep could understand everything Johan wanted from him.  \"Johan had two sons. Jordi, his son by blood, and his sports son...Pep.\" Jordi Cruyff echoes Martin's assessment of his father and Guardiola's close relationship.  Jordi remembers his father having supreme confidence in Guardiola as a budding manager after his protege wound down his playing career with underwhelming spells at Brescia, Roma, Al-Ahli and Mexican club Dorados. \"I know in that time Pep and my father had a lot of contact,\" Jordi Cruyff says of the months after Guardiola's retirement in 2006.  \"I think my father had this kind of intuition that he could feel when somebody is going to be a good coach.\" A frequent criticism of Guardiola is that all three of his top-level managerial jobs - Barcelona, Bayern Munich and Manchester City - have been clubs with big-name players and big pockets.  The inference is that the Spaniard couldn't work his magic in a smaller, more humble, setting.  It didn't get much smaller than Barcelona B. \"Yes, I was a player, but I'll start from zero as a coach,\" said Guardiola, then 37, in his first press conference in charge of Barcelona B. It was a surprise he had taken the job, given a role as head of the academy - seen as more prestigious - was also on the table.  However, Barcelona B, like Guardiola, were starting from scratch. In the previous season, they had been relegated after failing to win their final 10 matches.  Guardiola's first match in charge was a pre-season friendly played on a tiny, artificial pitch against Banyoles. Small pitches and, when matches were played on grass, bobbly surfaces were a theme in a tricky start to managerial life. Barcelona B won one of their first three matches.  After a 2-0 defeat by lowly Manresa, who were eventually relegated, Guardiola endured his first test of faith. Could his playing style - prioritising possession over position on the pitch - thrive in the testing conditions of the fourth tier?   By the time he arrived at training on the Wednesday after that defeat, he had made his mind up.  \"I had thought we have to change because the pitches are so small,\" he says.  \"I doubted for two days. But, in that moment, I decided - if we could win and play quite good football on a small pitch, I could do it at a higher level with better players and better pitches.  \"I arrived at training and said: 'This is what I believe.' The alternatives, the ways we looked at changing, they did not convince me. That is why I could not change. \"It was an important moment because I was new, I was not experienced. Aged 37, never trained big players. I had to prove myself.\" One man he didn't need to prove himself to was Domenec Torrent.  Torrent had been managing fellow fourth-tier outfit Girona. When Guardiola, a man he had revered as a player came knocking, Torrent jumped at the chance to join him. Torrent spent 11 years at Guardiola's side as his assistant before leaving Manchester City for a head coach role with New York City FC in 2018. \"I always say Pep has great powers of seduction,\" he says.  \"He's someone who can convince players with his everyday work with them. He's a sponge.  \"He learns very quickly about everything and everyone. \"He turned Barcelona B into a very compact side who played very good football. And he put across to the players his ideas, which were totally different from anything they'd heard up until then.  \"It's true that we built a very good squad.\" Sergio Busquets, Pedro and Thiago Alcantara were rookie faces in that squad and Guardiola was the uncompromising, relentless, ruthless driving force at the centre of it. Professionalism was to the fore. Opposition sides were scouted and video-analysed, a level of detail unheard of in that division at the time.  An 11pm curfew was introduced - as were fines.  \"Pep had very clear boundaries, he did not let anybody do anything that he thought was out of place,\" Pep's then-captain Marc Valiente has said. \"He had a very clear code. You had to adhere to that in terms of the rules, in terms of fines, and I think that was fair.\" Barcelona's then-sporting director Txiki Begiristain - now in the same job at Manchester City - also remembers Guardiola's pursuit of perfection.  \"It was unbelievable,\" Begiristain says. \"In England, the level would be like League Two.   \"Pep was working in League Two like he was in [charge of] the [Barcelona] first team: Looking after the players, food, chefs, travelling, recording the games. \"He was really amazing. He was thinking 'one day I'm gonna be a first-team coach, I wanna work like this'.   \"And so, he was already doing it in the fourth tier. It was crazy.\" After their inauspicious start, Guardiola's Barcelona B's form dramatically improved en route to winning promotion. Guardiola's work-rate won hearts in the boardroom, most notably with the most influential Barcelona face of all. \"I remember that Johan Cruyff visited a lot with his wife to see the Barca B games,\" Torrent says. \"And, strangely, I saw that instead of watching the game, he was watching Pep, how he managed, how he behaved, how he moved: his body language.  \"And I remember mentioning to Pep: 'That's the second time Johan's been to see you and he was just watching you.' All that made sense when Pep took over the first team. \"I remembered those afternoons when Johan came to see him, not the football.\"  Promotion cost Guardiola a fair bit of money. At the beginning of the campaign, he had promised to buy the team lunch if they won three games in a row. It happened on five occasions.  The team's most important performance, though, was to come in a friendly against Rijkaard's increasingly disjointed and disengaged first team, watched by a handful of spectators. \"I don't think I run and chased the ball as much ever,\" former Barcelona forward Eidur Gudjohnsen says. Combined with Cruyff's weekly scouting reports, the friendly was key to persuading the Barcelona board that Pep was the man for the top job. \"They had a certain way of playing,\" Gudjohnsen continues.  \"It was almost as if we couldn't get near them. I'm pretty sure some of some of the first-team players didn't take it as seriously as we should have.  \"But I still remember that I thought: 'Wow, how are they playing? Why is there always a spare man?' \"It was very difficult to pressure them.\"  For the first team, the match was an embarrassment. Ronaldinho was withdrawn after just 10 minutes. Deco also reportedly struggled in the face of the relentless reserves.  Pep's pressure was to prove too much for the Barcelona board as well. A combination of the B team's promotion, the friendly farce and Rijkaard's reticence to discipline his wayward squad forced a change at the top. The choice was clear. Europe's top dog, the all-conquering disciplinarian Jose Mourinho? Or the poetic choice, the possession-obsessed Pep Guardiola?  Xavier Sala-i-Martin was at the centre of those conversations as Barcelona treasurer and a board member between 2004 and 2010. \"Everybody knows we have this problem,\" he recounts in Pep Guardiola: Chasing Perfection.  \"Ronaldinho plays bongos until two in the morning every night. How do you stop it? We need a sergeant, a general.  \"Who is the greatest general in the world? Jose Mourinho right?  \"Given the problems we had, the solution seem obvious. Unfortunately, Mourinho doesn't fit with Barcelona's DNA.  \"Barcelona DNA has many aspects. One of them is the way we play.  \"We inherited these from Johan Cruyff. We win when we play Dutch-style football. The best student of Cruyff is Pep.  \"But Mourinho has won the Champions League. So there was a big debate.  \"But Joan Laporta said: 'We cannot go Mourinho's direction\u2026.he doesn't play our style. He's a defensive manager with counter-attacks. That's not the way we play.' \"And also, he's not a real gentleman. The way he tries to manipulate, he doesn't act the Barcelona way on the field.\" It still could have gone either way as Sala-i-Martin remembers but, for, appropriately the intervention of one man.  \"A lot of members of the board were in favour of Mourinho,\" he said.  \"Laporta consulted with Johan [Cruyff] and said do you think Pep's ready?  \"And Johan said yes. And when Johan says yes, it's yes.\" Ultimately, A-list Barcelona royalty insisted on an untested B team boss. And football has not been the same since.

        "text": " Last updated on 1 hour ago1 hour ago.From the section Premier League Everton's 2-0 win over fellow strugglers Nottingham Forest on Sunday gave their bid for Premier League survival a much-needed boost. Forest, meanwhile, remain just one point above 18th-placed Luton. The Hatters suffered a demoralising 5-1 thrashing by Brentford on Saturday, which keeps them right in the relegation battle. Burnley are building an unlikely survival bid after they defeated bottom side Sheffield United 4-1 on Saturday. Defeat means the maximum number of points the Blades can now get this season is 31 - and no team in the Premier League era has ever stayed up with fewer than 34 points. But, despite their big win, Burnley have only a 6.2% chance of survival, according to data analysts Opta.  Luton still have a 28.5% chance of being a Premier League side next season. BBC Sport breaks down the relegation battle statistics... The stats suggest Sheffield United's survival chances are very slim, with Opta giving them a 99% chance of relegation. Opta's model suggests the battle is really between Forest in 17th and Luton in 18th, with everyone else given less than 10% chance of survival or relegation depending on their current position. Crystal Palace: 24 April v Newcastle (home); 27 April v Fulham (away); 6 May v Manchester United (home); 11 May v Wolves (away); 19 May v Aston Villa (home). Brentford: 27 April v Everton (away); 4 May v Fulham (home); 11 May v Bournemouth (away); 19 May v Newcastle (home).

Sheffield United: 24 April v Manchester United (away); 27 April v Newcastle (away); 4 May v Nottm Forest (home); 11 May v Everton (away); 19 May v Tottenham (home). While Forest's four-point deduction for breaching profit and sustainability rules (PSR) has been applied, they have appealed against the decision - with their hearing date set for Wednesday, 24 April. Everton had a 10-point deduction imposed in November, which was reduced to six on appeal in February, for PSR breaches in the three-year period up to and including 2021-22. However, in January, they were charged again over alleged breaches in their accounts up to 2022-23 and the outcome of that was another two-point deduction. Everton have appealed against the decision. Despite previous concerns that this PSR process could run beyond the final day of the season, the Premier League has confirmed the outcome of Everton's appeal will be known before the final day of the season."

        "text": " Last updated on 1 hour ago1 hour ago.From the section Sport Manchester United co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe competed in two separate races on Sunday. The 71-year-old lined up for his eighth London Marathon in the morning and then faced a race against time to watch his side face Coventry in the FA Cup semi-final at Wembley in the afternoon.  The British billionaire is an avid runner and has completed more than 30 marathons worldwide, while his chemical group Ineos supported Kenya's Eliud Kipchoge in his successful bid to become the first person to break the two-hour mark for a marathon in October 2019.  Ratcliffe finished last year's London Marathon in four hours 32 minutes 47 seconds.  With his 10:00 BST start time on Sunday, that would have left him just under an hour to complete the journey from the finish line on The Mall and get to Wembley for the 15:30 kick-off.  At 14:00, when Ratcliffe was between 35-40km, the journey between the two would have taken between 45-50 minutes, according to Google Maps.  It was set to be touch and go for boyhood United fan Ratcliffe.  He crossed the finish line at 14:33, shaving one minute and 55 seconds off last year's attempt, to finish in 4:30:52.  That left him with around 55 minutes to get across London and into the directors box at England's national football stadium.  Despite that, he stopped and spoke to BBC Sport on The Mall, and said: \"At my age, that [time] is not bad. I need to be quick, I need to be there at half-time. \"There are some parallels [between football and running a marathon] I have to say, but it just requires some grit. Running a marathon after 30km is difficult. \"I must leave now. I've got a match to get to!\" True to his word, Ratcliffe was seen minutes into the second half deep in conversation with Avram Glazer, who is part of the American family that Ratcliffe brought his stake from.  Ratcliffe would have been satisfied with news of what had happened in the first half that he missed, with goals from Scott McTominay and Harry Maguire putting them 2-0 up.  Bruno Fernandes added a third to put United in complete control, but, from there, Ratcliffe's day, which had gone pretty smoothly to that point, took a turn. Championship side Coventry scored three times in the final 20 minutes to take the tie dramatically to extra time. Both sides hit the bar during the addition half an hour before Coventry, looking to reach their first final since they won the tournament in 1987, had a goal ruled out by the video assistant referee for offside in the final minute.  United went on to win 4-2 on penalties to set up a repeat of the 2023 FA Cup final against local neighbours Manchester City.  All's well that ends well for Ratcliffe. "

        "text": " Last updated on Less than a minute agoLess than a minute ago.From the section Gateshead Gateshead have been barred from taking part in the National League play-offs after failing to meet the entry criteria for membership of the English Football League. The club failed to secure a \"10-year security of tenure\" at the International Stadium, where they have played since 1971-72, by 1 March. The National League said Gateshead cannot be replaced in the play-offs. Gateshead finished sixth in the table and were set to play Solihull Moors. \"Gateshead Football Club are extremely disappointed to find ourselves in the position as outlined in the statements released by the EFL and the National League,\" the club said. \"Rest assured we will continue to challenge both on their decisions, and we will endeavour to ensure that footballing matters are decided on the pitch. \"Therefore our players and staff remain 100% focused on the task in hand, and we wish to go on record to express our gratitude to the National League for supporting our challenge to the EFL.\"  Gateshead's planned eliminator on Tuesday, 23 April has now been cancelled. The National League initially said Solihull would get a bye to the semi-finals but then adjusted the draw based on final league positions. Altrincham, who finished fourth, will now get a bye to the semi-finals, where they will travel to Bromley, while Solihull will host FC Halifax Town on Wednesday for the right to visit Barnet in the last four. In a statement,external-link the National League said it was \"extremely disappointed\" that Gateshead would not be able to take part after supporting the club's application for the security of tenure, allowing them to extend the lease on the stadium, which is owned by Gateshead Council. \"Unfortunately, the response received was not supportive of the club's requirements and placed the club at risk of a refusal of membership to the EFL and therefore forfeiture of any right to participate in the play-offs,\" the statement said. \"On 28 March 2024, following the deadline for licence applications to the EFL had passed, the council offered options to the club. However, in the opinion of the EFL these options still did not satisfy their requirements.\" An appeal by the club, which was supported by the National League, was rejected by an EFL arbitration panel. \"As the EFL strongly believes in the principles of promotion and relegation it is therefore highly disappointing that appropriate solutions have not been put in place over the previous two-year period, as avoidable circumstances are preventing Gateshead from progressing up the pyramid even if the club achieves success through sporting merit,\" an EFL statement added.external-link \"The League hopes that Gateshead and the relevant stakeholders can address this matter so that the club can meet the obligations of EFL membership and be eligible for promotion in future seasons.\""

        "text": " Sometimes, a fighter just has that look in his eye.   Anthony Joshua was blissfully unaware of the drowsy steward slumped next to the railings in the Kingdom Arena, or the panic-stricken British reporter worrying if he would make his flight in less than five hours.  It was 03:30 local time when the Briton strutted to the ring with the look of a man already certain of the outcome.   Francis Ngannou bounced up and down on his toes. He saluted his fans who excitedly blew their vuvuzela horns.  But in a blink of some weary eyes, the fight was over. Joshua scored a brutal second-round stoppage win over the former UFC champion.  The rejuvenated steward was back on his feet and the journalist would make his flight with time to spare. \"I've got the will to win and that's what's most important,\" Joshua said to the media an hour later.  \"Half of these people thought he was going to beat me. I can see you lot. You lot thought he was going to beat me.  \"I just do what I do. Do my best. Get the job done. I don't do it to prove anything. I just do it for myself.\" It was a statement victory made all the sweeter with Joshua's arch-nemesis, compatriot Tyson Fury, watching on. Just 133 days ago, in the same arena and against the same opponent, Fury fought tooth and nail with Ngannou in a split decision points win that could have gone either way.  \"Francis Ngannou beat the WBC heavyweight champion of the world. I should be the WBC heavyweight champion of the world right now. You know what I mean? I think he beat [Fury],\" Joshua said.  Boxing debutant Ngannou dropped Fury in the third round of their October bout but was still very much an unknown quantity coming into his second bout.  \"Did I expect to win? I do my best,\" Joshua added. \"I don't like to predict anything. Heavyweight boxing is a league of its own, different division. Anything can happen.  \"I just work hard, extremely hard. I think I can work harder, be a bit more dedicated.\"  Fury will contest the undisputed heavyweight crown against  WBA, WBO and IBF champion Oleksandr Usyk in May. A rematch is already in place but Saudi organisers and promoter Eddie Hearn would like the winner to face Joshua.  But rather than call out the champions or hype up his victory, Joshua - as he has done throughout fight week - kept it low key.  Instead he used his time on the mic in the post-fight news conference to pay credit to trainer Ben Davison.  Davison - who previously trained Fury - linked up with Joshua late last year and has now guided him to two commanding stoppage wins.  \"I've always had a tool bag for the tools, Ben's just shown me which ones to use for the right job,\" Joshua said.  \"That's all it is. We work well together. He's just showing me which tools to use for the job.\" Joshua - competing in Saudi for the fourth time - is now on a four-fight winning streak as he bids to become a three-time world champion.  \"I try not to get too down when things aren't going my way. I'm just chilling,\" Joshua added. \"I'm not getting too ahead with myself. Rolling into the next one.\" The hustle and bustle of Riyadh - with traffic jams on every corner - may not seem serene at first, but Joshua has seemingly enjoyed the lack of attention in fight week.  He was stopped by some fans for photos and fist bumps during fight week, but a 6ft 6in fighter being followed by a camera crew is bound to attract some attention.  Joshua has not, however, been mobbed like he would be out and about near his north London home. Or anywhere in the UK for that matter.  He is not being harassed with questions on fighting Fury or being heckled by students. Joshua does pay a price for fame but he has been reimbursed rather handsomely for his troubles. Forbes reports he could earn in excess of $50m (\u00c2\u00a339m) for the win over Ngannou - not taking pay-per-view or sponsorship earnings into account.  He may feel at home in Saudi and time will tell if we see Joshua - one of only a few fighters who can sell out a stadium - fight in the UK again any time soon. But what we do know is the 2012 Olympic champion has rediscovered his swagger in the ring. "

        "text": " American heavyweight Deontay Wilder has signed with Matchroom Boxing and will face Zhilei Zhang as part of the five-versus-five card against Queensberry Promotions on 1 June in Saudi Arabia. Wilder's link up with promoter Eddie Hearn came as a surprise as Matchroom and Queensberry unveiled their fighters in the most spectacular fashion at a news conference in London.  The 10 fighters wore white masks before being unveiled one by one.  Heavyweight Daniel Dubois - the first to be revealed - will face Filip Hrgovic in a world-title final eliminator in Riyadh and Liverpool featherweight Nick Ball will challenge WBA world champion Raymond Ford.  A middleweight contest between unbeaten Londoner Hamzah Sheeraz and American Austin 'Ammo' Williams and an all-British cruiserweight bout between Willy Hutchinson and Craig Richards complete the line-up.  Wilder was the last man to be unmasked. He bellowed his trademark 'Bomb Squad' as a grinning Hearn pumped his fist.  \"Nobody ever thought me and Eddie would be working together. This is the ultimate surprise,\" Wilder said.  Hearn added: \"For one night only, we work together.\"  The Hearn and Wilder link-up is equally surprising, and demonstrates how any rift is fixable with Saudi influence.  They have been at each other's throats for the best part of decade as Hearn backed Matchroom's Anthony Joshua in a potential fight which has not yet materialised Wilder - who has boxed primarily on Al Haymon's Premier Boxing Championship  - was one of the most destructive power punchers in the division but has won just one bout since November 2019 and was outpointed by Joseph Parker in December.  \"We'll see if I've got it or not. This fight I'm holding it as my last dance, my last chance,\" an emotional Wilder, 38, said.  \"I lost my love and passion for this business. I lost my hunger for so many different reasons  \"I'm not playing around this time. I've got nothing to lose.\"  Matchroom v Queensberry will form the undercard to the undisputed light-heavyweight contest between undefeated Russian Dmitry Bivol and Artur Beterbiev, a blockbuster for the boxing purists.   \"It's the best fight in boxing,\" Hearn said as the two Russians took to the stage in London.  After a traditional style news conference for Beterbiev-Bivol, the event soon turned into The Masked Singer meets WWE.  Hearn and Warren talked up the undercard as the masked fighters waited patiently. Not everything went to plan, however, as the Matchroom boss prematurely mentioned the still masked Ball's name.  The rivalry between Britain's two biggest promotional companies in the sport dates back to the 1980s, when Hearn's father Barry was at the helm for Matchroom. \"Growing up as a kid I'd hear the name [Warren] on the phone. It wasn't always pleasant but I'd hear them arguing,\" Heard said.  Hearn and Warren - who had reportedly never met until last year - were brought together by Turki Alalshikh, chairman of Saudi Arabia's general entertainment authority.  Alalshikh - with the riches of Saudi Arabia behind him but under the backdrop of sports washing accusations - convinced the two to bury the hatchet.  \"We're not friends really, I want to absolutely destroy Queensberry,\" Hearn added, tongue-in-cheek.  With bragging rights at stake, one point will be awarded for a decision win and two points for a knockout or technical knockout, with captains' points worth double.  Hearn selected Wilder to lead his team, with Queensberry's Sheeraz skippering for Warren.  The only real needle between the two teams came in an exchange between Londoner Dubois and Croatian Hrgovic as they discussed sparring together.  \"I'm a different animal now,\" Dubois said.  Hrgovic replied: \"I hope he's changed otherwise he will last one round only. That sparring wasn't good for him.\"  The winner could face Anthony Joshua for a vacant IBF title later in the year.  Current IBF champion, Oleksandr Usyk, will face Tyson Fury for all four world titles in May. A two-fight deal is in place, meaning a sanctioning body is likely to force the winner to vacate."

        "text": " American Ryan Garcia weighed 3.2lb over the 10st limit for Saturday's light-welterweight contest against compatriot Devin Haney in Brooklyn, New York.  The fight at the Barclays Center will go ahead after Garcia's team agreed to compensate world champion Haney. But Garcia, 25, will not be eligible to win Haney's WBC title. At a bizarre weigh-in, Garcia downed what appeared to be a beer on the scales and the two were held apart by security during an intense face-off. Haney's father and trainer Bill sparked a minor melee before the face-off and Golden Boy promoter Oscar de la Hoya had the difficult job of trying to keep a screaming Garcia and Haney apart from each other. \"Enough of that funny business, we have a fight tomorrow,\" Garcia said. \"I did my best to make this weight. I put myself through hell. At the end of the day I am the best fighter here. I am going to knock him out and everybody will be cheering.\" Garcia's antics have been criticised in the build-up, with several erratic, often unsubstantiated and defamatory social media posts in recent months.  The Californian launched a foul-mouthed tirade at both 25-year-old Haney and a member of the crowd at Thursday's news conference. He also shook hands with Haney after the champion demanded $500,000 in compensation for every pound Garcia weighed over the limit, despite the challenger's team instructing him not to agree to the deal.  Haney posted on social media to say Garcia had \"honoured the $500k per pound\" deal. Two-weight world champion Haney has won all 31 pro bouts and is widely considered one of boxing's pound-for-pound stars.  Garcia boasts 24 wins with one defeat - a stoppage loss to Gervonta Davis in April 2023. "

        "text": " A gym tucked away behind a non-league football team's clubhouse is not the typical place to prepare for a world title fight. But training in this unconventional location - next to eighth-tier Avro FC's Vestacare Stadium on an Oldham housing estate - suits Rhiannon Dixon just fine. She proudly describes herself as \"an anomaly when it comes to women's boxing\", having only taken up the sport aged 21 as a pharmacy student at Manchester University. Now, seven years later, she has won all nine of her pro fights and is gearing up for her shot at a lightweight belt recently vacated by Katie Taylor. Warrington-born Dixon faces Argentina's Karen Elizabeth Carabajal for the WBO title in the more auspicious surroundings of the Manchester Arena on Saturday. The Briton was working as a pharmacist as recently as last year - having also done so during the Covid pandemic - before focusing on boxing full-time. \"I started boxing when I was 21, then at 28 I'm fighting for a world title - it's what dreams are made of, and it means so much I can do it so close to home as well,\" she tells BBC Sport. How Dixon went from pharmacist to boxer Scotney drawing on childhood for 'biggest stage' 'Zelfa's come from a life of hell' - Barrett's emotional story While Dixon may be short on big-fight experience, her trainer Anthony Crolla is not. The former world champion agreed to coach Dixon for a session following his retirement in 2019, after her manager called him while he was on holiday in Portugal - and the pair have worked together since. If Dixon beats Carabajal, she will become the first world champion trained by Crolla from his Fox ABC gym. It is not only their backgrounds and experience in which fighter and trainer are very different, but their outlooks on training - and Dixon believes that is one of the reasons why the partnership works. \"I'm very self-critical, I will walk out and say 'that's the worst sparring of my life',\" she says.  \"Ant is like 'what are you on about', and I point out this, this and this.  \"He'll then say 'you did all this, everything I asked you to', but I'll say 'I'm pathetic' and have to hang my head in shame.\" Crolla admits he may give Dixon \"kittens\" due to his laid-back attitude, compared to her \"military\" approach, but that contrast has helped elevate her as a fighter - while he has improved as a coach having learned from Joe Gallagher, the man who led him to a world title. \"Joe was very meticulous,\" he says. \"I'll be honest, I will never be as meticulous as Joe, but I do my best to study opponents. \"My team here will watch fights then talk tactics over with Rhiannon. As a coach it is great to get recognition but I am grateful for the team around me.\" The 37-year-old acknowledges he will have to guide the inexperienced Dixon through the biggest night of her boxing life, and admits even he has been taken aback by her rapid rise. \"It's possibly come a fight or two earlier than ideal, because of her inexperience,\" Crolla says. \"But it is a fight with her confidence that she should win, and can win in style. \"We wouldn't put her in for a fight if we didn't think she was ready. I believe she will be world champion.\" While Dixon will be the one in the ring, it will be a huge night for Crolla personally as his charge fights at the arena where he won the WBA lightweight title against Darleys Perez in 2015. He says Dixon has to keep her cool against the more experienced Carabajal, 33, who has only lost once in 23 bouts - a narrow defeat by Taylor at Wembley in 2022. Crolla's younger brother William is also fighting on the card against an as-yet unconfirmed opponent, and the trainer admits it will be difficult - but crucial - to keep his emotions in check too. \"I care about all of my fighters, but this is the biggest night [of my coaching career],\" he says.  \"It is a very special night for me, probably very emotional, and as a coach I have to keep my emotions in check. But these are the nights you get into coaching for. \"A world title fight in Manchester where I had so many big nights myself - I couldn't have written it any better. \"It is the stuff of fairytales, it makes me unbelievably proud and I want it so bad for Rhiannon because I see how hard she works.\" Nobody runs forever...: Clint Eastwood stars as Earl Stone, an elderly horticulturist turned drug mule 'This is the sort of operation you lose sleep over': Meet the world-leading surgeons pushing science and the human body to its limits"

        "description": "Venue: ",
        "text": " For years, Katie Taylor has been the biggest name in women's lightweight boxing - but the Irish star cannot fight forever. Certainly Taylor is not finished yet. Her promoter, Eddie Hearn, confirmed to BBC Sport this week that talks are progressing regarding a rematch with Amanda Serrano. Hearn said Taylor-Serrano II is \"the favourite\" among several potential bouts that could happen this summer, while reports in the Republic of Ireland have claimed the fight could happen in Las Vegas and be the first combat sports event at the new Sphere arena. While Taylor is the biggest name, she is no longer a giant fish in a tiny pond, with lightweight now one of the most competitive divisions in women's boxing. Two of the main pretenders to the queen's crown meet in Manchester on Saturday, as Rhiannon Dixon and Karen Elizabeth Carabajal face off for the WBO lightweight title, which was vacated by Taylor. The 37-year-old from Bray also holds the WBA and WBC lightweight belts - plus five light-welterweight titles - but, for the first time in a long while, there is a gap in the market. Time is also catching up with other big names in women's lightweight boxing, such as Britain's Natasha Jonas and Melissa St Vil of Haiti, who are either nearing or have reached the age of 40. And, as Hearn told BBC Sport, there are plenty of candidates to move into that gap. \"Caroline Dubois is a great talent,\" he said. \"We have Beatriz Ferreira from Brazil, a three-time amateur world champion, she is probably going to win gold in Paris. 'Anomaly' Dixon set for 'fairytale' world title fight Serrano likely to be next Taylor opponent - Hearn Gill brushes off hecklers ahead of Barrett bout \"Katie is still there, and Terri Harper is looking to come down to 135, so there are big fights for Rhiannon ahead if she can win.\" South Americans Carabajal and Ferreira will consider themselves serious world title contenders.  Argentina's Carabajal is still only 33, and her only defeat in 23 fights was by Taylor in 2022. Ferreira, 31, is another who is improving with experience fights for the vacant IBF title later this month before focusing her attention to representing Brazil at the Paris Olympics. But it is London-born Dubois, who holds the IBO lightweight title, who many have tipped to succeed Taylor. Dubois has been backed for greatness since bursting on to the amateur scene as a teenager and competing at the Tokyo Olympics. Her perfect professional career so far has so far given substance to the high praise. At 23 years old and with five knockouts from her nine-fight career, she has time and power on her side. Skye Nicolson, the newly minted WBC champion at featherweight, has been watching Dubois since the amateurs. \"A crafty southpaw, she's very physically strong for the weight as well, she is very hard to beat. I think you can say now she beats everyone in that division,\" she said. \"Her toughest test will probably be Beatriz Ferreira, I think it is competitive between the two and that is a super-fight down the line in the women's division.\" Warrington's Dixon has been inspired through her career by Taylor - but is not overawed by the possibility of stepping to her level. She proudly calls herself an \"anomaly\", having come from white-collar boxing to compete for a world title on Saturday, and says that unusual background is a benefit. \"They all had a lot of amateur background, or these superstars who went to the Olympics,\" she said of her lightweight peers. \"I've shown girls you can start a sport later in life, and if you put all your effort into it you can excel. It's important to have people in the sport from different backgrounds, showing you can do it too.\""

        "text": " Undisputed light-welterweight champion Katie Taylor's rematch with Amanda Serrano will take place in Texas on 20 July. Taylor, 37, defeated Serrano via split decision in an all-time lightweight classic two years ago. Taylor is now undisputed champion at light-welterweight and Serrano steps up in weight again to face the Irishwoman. The highly anticipated rematch will be the co-main event to Jake Paul v Mike Tyson at Dallas' AT&T Stadium. \"This is the rematch the world has wanted to see,\" said Taylor.  \"The first fight in New York was obviously an epic occasion and it more than lived up to the billing, and I'm sure the rematch will be no different.\" Taylor moved up to light-welterweight after beating Serrano, suffering her first ever loss to Chantelle Cameron in May 2023 before avenging the defeat last November. The win over Cameron saw Taylor become a two-weight undisputed champion, having also achieved the feat at lightweight. After losing to Taylor, 35-year-old Serrano subsequently became undisputed champion at featherweight and has won four fights in a row. The Taylor defeat was only the second loss of Serrano's career and the seven-division world champion held the WBO light-welterweight belt in 2018. Serrano relinquished her WBC featherweight title last year in order to fight in 12, three-minute rounds but has decided to resume fighting at 10, two-minute rounds to face Taylor. \"I promised my fans they would see this rematch after we made history at MSG and it feels like a dream come true to know that Katie and I are finally making it happen on the biggest stage possible to show the world what elite women's boxing is all about,\" said Serrano.  \"While my focus continues to be on giving women the choice to fight with the same rules as men, I've always said that this is the one fight I'd go back to 10x2 for.\" Nicolson frustrated by Serrano's round time stance Taylor and Serrano's first encounter at Madison Square Garden was a seminal moment in women's boxing as two female fighters headlined at MSG for the first time. But it was the nature of the contest that has lived on as the two rivals put on a stunning display, Taylor coming out a narrow winner. After their first fight took years to come to fruition, the rematch has stopped and started in the two years since, but has now been delivered - and on Netflix. The streaming giant has a global audience of 260m and will broadcast the fight at no extra cost for its subscribers.  After the first bout drew a record 1.5m viewers on DAZN, the rematch could eclipse that figure with YouTuber turned boxer Paul fighting heavyweight legend Tyson the same night. Tyson described Taylor and Serrano as \"two of the best boxers\" in the world and the event as a \"true gift to fans\". It could draw a record crowd for women's boxing with AT&T Stadium able to welcome 80,000 fans, compared to the 19,187 who attended Taylor-Serrano 1. Both women have achieved more history since their fight. Taylor became just the third fighter male or female to win undisputed titles at two weights, while Serrano became Puerto Rico's first undisputed champion in the four-belt era. At light-welterweight Serrano will be an underdog again, but after previously rising to the occasion, she is targeting the stoppage she couldn't produce in their first encounter. \"I believe I won our first fight, but I didn't get the decision, so this time I'm not leaving it to the judges,\" she said."

        "text": " Sandy Ryan is sporting a fading black eye as she explains why fellow Briton Terri Harper is exactly the type of challenge she has been looking for. The pair fight in Sheffield on Saturday for Ryan's WBO welterweight title with the champion, like so many of her peers, searching for that breakout fight that will make her a pound-for-pound contender. Five months ago Ryan came agonisingly close to becoming unified champion. A controversial draw with WBA and WBC champion Jessica McCaskill in Florida made sure the belts stayed with the American.  \"I proved a lot in that fight,\" says the 30-year-old. \"Even though I'm a world champion, I still only have a few fights under my belt. There is still so much for people to see of Sandy Ryan.\" McCaskill is a former undisputed champion at the weight - a trailblazer in women's boxing - but while her name carries weight, Doncaster's Harper and Derby's Ryan grew up just over an hour away from each other. \"All-British clash - it makes it a bigger fight,\" Ryan says. Harper, 27, is a two-weight world champion with 14 wins in 17 fights and is bidding to join an elite club of British fighters to win a belt in a third weight in the modern era. Ryan is hopeful a convincing win over Harper can be a breakout moment for her. The man aiming to topple the Hatton boxing dynasty LISTEN: 5 Live Boxing with Steve Bunce Ryan v Harper may come down to heart - Copeland column Ryan said: \"You've got a lot of people saying it's 50/50. I respect Terri, really nice girl, but I'm very confident. \"I don't see it being 50/50, so this is where I can make a statement. \"[This is a] fight that will give me more recognition, build my name and reputation.\" Ryan has overhauled her coaching team, and her life, since the draw against McCaskill. She has sparred with two-weight undisputed champions Katie Taylor and Claressa Shields and relocated her training camp to Las Vegas.  Ireland's Taylor specially thanked Ryan for helping her overcome Chantelle Cameron in their rematch last November.  \"That says a lot in itself,\" Ryan says. \"Katie doesn't talk a lot so for her to say that, I'm grateful.\" Cameron might have been undisputed light-welterweight champion before she fought Taylor, but beating the pound-for-pound star in Dublin propelled the Northampton fighter to the main stage of boxing.  Ryan wants the rematch with McCaskill, who is now scheduled to fight Lauren Price on 11 May in Cardiff.  Keen to have her own big moment, Ryan hasn't seen much of the famous Strip in her eight weeks in the States, instead \"locking\" herself away in training, inviting Shields to Vegas to spar. \"I don't really know other females who have sparred them both,\" Ryan says of Taylor and Shields. \"They've both achieved a lot, they're at the pinnacle of the sport, where I want to get to,\" she adds. \"I belong up there with the top girls. It gives me that confidence to know yeah, I'm a world champion. I'm Sandy Ryan. For someone to beat me now, you have to be special.\" Harper has won world titles at super-featherweight and light-middleweight. This fight is her first at welterweight. Ryan has far less experience in the pro ranks, with just eight fights and six wins, but she says her confidence has grown rapidly since fighting McCaskill. \"I'd say Jess is more of a threat to me than Harper is,\" she says. \"I'm the better fighter, all round. It's not cocky, I just feel confident.  \"I respect Terri, she is a great fighter but I believe I'm better.\""

        "text": " Former world champion Josh Taylor says boxing \"will be a duller place\" without Willie Limond, who has died aged 45. Ex-British and Commonwealth light-welterweight champion Limond won 42 of his 48 professional fights from 1999 to 2023 - and 13 by knockout - although only three bouts took place after 2016.  Four of his losses were to fighters who won world titles - Amir Khan, Anthony Crolla, Erik Morales and Ricky Burns.  \"It's a terrible day for Scottish sport,\" Taylor told BBC Scotland. \"The man in general was a larger-than-life character. He was always funny. He was one of life's good guys.  \"It's such a tragic, tragic loss. Scotland's lost one of its favourite sons, especially in boxing. It's a huge loss.\" Limond was originally a footballer, playing five times for Albion Rovers in the late 1990s. In his distinguished boxing career he held the British super-featherweight, light-welterweight and lightweight titles as well as the Commonwealth light-welterweight, WBU lightweight and IBO Inter-Continental lightweight crowns. In a post on social media, his son Jake said his \"dad passed away in the early hours of the morning\".  \"He fought on for near enough 10 days. Warrior,\" he added on Instagram. Limond fought countryman Burns in September, with the referee stopping the fight at the end of the eighth round because of excessive blood from his nose. He announced his retirement from the sport afterwards but was set to face Joe Laws at Emirates Arena in Glasgow on 3 May. Laws posted on Instagram: \"I'm absolutely devastated. Willie just wanted to make a better life for his family. \"Willie my old son, wait for me at the pearly gates - we can get it on. Legends never die.\" Limond was found in an unresponsive state in a car in Coatbridge, North Lanarkshire, on 6 April and was taken to Monklands Hospital, where he died. Police Scotland say there are no suspicious circumstances. One of Limond's most famous bouts was a Commonwealth lightweight title meeting in 2007 against Khan, when the Athens Olympics silver medallist was an unbeaten rising star. Limond gave Khan - who went into the fight with nine knockouts from his then 12 fights - the toughest test of his early professional career, knocking the 20-year-old down before losing by stoppage.  He knocked Khan to the canvas in the sixth round but was denied what he felt was a knockout by a significant delay before the count began.  The Bolton fighter then took control, with Limond forced to retire from the fight because of a broken jaw before the start of the ninth round. Limond won a WBU title and in 2010 took on four-weight world champion Morales in a title fight in Mexico, going down three times in the sixth. He lost to Crolla on points in his next British title fight at light-welterweight level before three successful Commonwealth title fights, the latter also securing him the British title with victory over Curtis Woodhouse in 2014. Former world champion Crolla posted a 'heartbroken' emoji on X and, along with a recent photo of himself and Limond, wrote: \"Not just in boxing but in life as well. One of the best men I ever met.\" Woodhouse, who was beaten by Limond at Braehead Arena in 2014, also paid tribute to the fighter on X, formerly known as Twitter. \"Absolutely devastated to hear the news of the passing of Willie Limond, a great fighter and a great man,\" the Englishman wrote. \"We stayed in touch after our fight and always had a laugh together. Absolutely gutted. Rest in peace champ.\" St Andrew's Sporting Club - who were scheduled to stage Limond's fight with Laws - posted on social media: \"Everyone at St Andrew's Sporting Club are shocked and deeply saddened at the loss of our friend, Willie Limond. \"Willie was not only a legend of the sport, but an infectious character who will be greatly missed by us all.  \"Our thoughts and prayers are with Jake, Drew, Macy and the rest of the Limond family at this time.\""

The Americans, both 25, will meet at the Barclay Center, Brooklyn, New York.  Garcia launched a foul-mouthed tirade at both Haney and a member of the crowd at Thursday's news conference.  \"The antics are almost done. This isn't an easy fight but a fight I will make look easy,\" Haney said.   \"I have my tunnel vision. It will show. All his antics and all the things he has been doing will betray him and it will show.\"  Haney pushed fellow Californian Garcia in the face during a promotional meet-up at the top of New York's Empire State Building on Tuesday, and the bad blood that has dominated the build-up continued two days later. Garcia - who has spoken openly about his mental health struggles in the past - has posted several erratic, often unsubstantiated and defamatory, social media posts in recent months, leading to concerns from the boxing community over his wellbeing. \"What do you guys want me to say? I've already said everything,\" he said.  Garcia - who boasts 24 wins with one defeat and is known for his blistering hand speed - then repeatedly yelled \"I'm on fire\" and \"I'm strong\" before returning his seat.  Moments later, he directed a number of expletive-laden insults towards a Haney supporter in the audience.  Two-weight world champion Haney, dressed in all black with matching sunglasses and gloves, remained expressionless.   Haney will make a first defence of his 140lb crown. He has won all 31 pro bouts and is widely considered one of boxing's pound-for-pound stars.  His father and trainer, Bill Haney, and promoter, Eddie Hearn, suggested Garcia's behaviour should not been taken seriously.  \"The promotion you have given this fight has been unbelievable. Baffling, but unbelievable,\" Hearn told Garcia.  Haney Sr added: \"Ryan has fooled the people into thinking he's something other than a great fighter,\" before handing Garcia a book titled Psychology for Dummies. "

The Britons have rarely crossed paths despite their long-running rivalry. Joshua, Fury and Ngannou took a picture together, alongside footballer Cristiano Ronaldo and Saudi powerbroker Turki Alalshikh. \"I'm quite territorial,\" Joshua told BBC Sport.  \"When I'm in a room, I'll call them my enemies or my competitors. I don't really smile. I can't fake it.  \"There's a lot of fake people on these fight weeks. I can't really fake it with it with people.\"  Promoter Eddie Hearn described Fury as being \"on golden form\", saying 'The Gypsy King' did not directly speak to Joshua but did take aim at Ngannou for suggesting he won their fight in October.  Joshua - who was not in the room when Fury and Ngannou clashed - added: \"I heard something happened between Ngannou but Ngannou would get him a headlock and chop him up. \"All this boxing stuff, on the streets MMA rules 100%.\" Could Joshua v Ngannou winner fight for undisputed title next?

He has resolved conflicts and rivalries between fighters and promoters, including Hearn and Warren, and there is increased hope Fury and Joshua could finally happen.  WBC champion Fury arrived in Riyadh earlier on Tuesday and is expected to be ringside on Friday as his brother, 27-year-old Roman Fury, is fighting on the undercard. \"I think years ago that might have affected AJ, but not anymore. Now he's just laser focused,\" Hearn said.  \"Be interesting to see what Tyson Fury does at ringside.\" As Saudi Arabia faces repeated accusations of using elite level sport to deflect conversation away from its poor human rights record, their investment in boxing does not appear to be slowing down. While the interest of the locals is questionable, with a lack of fans attending the fight week festivities so far, the money being pumped into the build-up is staggering. The production levels for the promotional videos - lending to the arcade fight computer game theme - would put many Hollywood trailers to shame.

        "text": " Ellie Scotney claimed her second world super-bantamweight title as she overpowered Segolene Lefebvre on a great night for British women's boxing at Manchester Arena. Scotney added the WBO belt to her IBF title as she dominated her French opponent over 10 rounds, winning on the judges' scorecards 99-91, 97-93, 96-94. The London-born fighter has now won all nine of her professional bouts, with Lefebvre suffering her first loss in 19 fights. Earlier, Rhiannon Dixon completed her journey from pharmacist to world champion as she beat Karen Elizabeth Carabajal to claim the WBO lightweight belt. In the headline event, Zelfa Barrett delighted his home Manchester crowd by stopping Jordan Gill to claim the WBA international super-featherweight title. Barrett dropped Gill to the canvas twice in round 10 with body shots, before a succession of blows to the head led to the referee waving off the fight. Scotney, despite being significantly shorter than her opponent, weighed in three pounds heavier and made that count with punches more powerful than those of Lefebvre. She also had greater stamina, the French fighter tiring from round three onwards - although she stuck to her task and made the fight closer on the scorecards than it appeared in the ring. Scotney started to land heavier blows as the contest wore on - a huge body shot in the fifth and a stunning right in the sixth. Lefebvre attempted to find a haymaker, knowing she was behind, but for every shot landed was being hit by three. She also earned a warning in round eight for a naughty jab at Scotney after the referee had called a pause. Nothing could stop the rapid-fire Scotney however, with the 26-year-old once again proving why she is one of the toughest contenders in women's boxing. She has still not yet won a professional bout by knockout, with her world-title-winning fight against Cherneka Johnson and the first defence against Laura Soledad Griffa both going the distance - and the marathon woman was victorious over the distance again to become unified champion. Warrington-born Dixon also went 10 rounds for her title, winning on the judges' scorecards 98-91 97-92 96-93. The Briton had dropped Carabajal to the canvas with a juddering left hook in round three, although the Argentine found her feet on the count of eight and recovered to take the fight into the latter stages. Dixon was the more energetic fighter throughout, while Carabajal counter-punched as she showed the same steel that took her the distance against against Katie Taylor. But victory ensures Dixon continues her perfect professional record, winning all 10 of her bouts. 'I don't like hurting people' - how Briton went from pharmacist to boxer It also completes a remarkable story for the 28-year-old, who only took up boxing seven years ago and was working as a pharmacist as recently as last year. But she has been trained into a world-class boxer by former world champion Anthony Crolla, who saw his charge claim her title at the same arena where he won his own lightweight title, eight and a half years ago. And Dixon was good value for the unanimous verdict, earning her the WBO belt vacated by Taylor. Carabajal, 33, meanwhile suffered only the second defeat of her 24-fight career, having previously been beaten by Taylor at Wembley Arena. Dixon was the more energetic fighter from the off, and scored the critical breakthrough in the early stages of round three as her powerful left found its mark on the South American champion. It looked as if it would only be a matter of time before Dixon would be crowned champion - but Carabajal showed admirable guts and worried Dixon with some solid punches as the fight wore on, even as the Englishwoman scored with regular body shots. At the end of round seven, Crolla had to reassure his exhausted fighter: \"You're six minutes away from winning a world title. Do not throw this away. She is every bit as tired as you.\" Carabajal raised a swelling on her opponent's eye and the final round descended into a slugfest as Dixon's defences dropped - but she did enough to write another chapter in her remarkable story. It was a great night for the Crolla family all round, as Anthony's younger brother William impressively stopped Fabio Cascone in the first round of their light-middleweight bout. Crolla brought the Italian to his knees just 71 seconds into the second fight of the night with a fierce body shot, to take his own perfect professional record to five wins, four by knockout.

        "description": "American Ryan Garcia floored Devin Haney three times in a majority points win over his compatriot on a dramatic night in Brooklyn, New York. ",
        "text": " American Ryan Garcia floored Devin Haney three times in a majority points win over his compatriot on a dramatic night in Brooklyn, New York.  Garcia's left hook was his greatest asset as the previously unbeaten world champion Haney was floored in the seventh, 10th and 11th rounds. Scorecards of 112-112, 114-110 and 115-109 saw the decision go to Garcia.  The Californian, however, did not win Haney's WBC light-welterweight title after missing weight for the contest.  \"You really thought I was crazy? You all lost your own minds,\" said Garcia, who had been criticised for his behaviour in the build-up.  The 25-year-old had posted a series of erratic, often unsubstantiated and defamatory social media posts in recent months. \"You guys overegg everything,\" Garcia added. He extended his record to 25 wins and one defeat, while it was Haney's first pro defeat in 32 bouts. In his post-fight news conference, Garcia said he had been \"drinking every night\" in the build-up to the bout after getting divorced earlier this year. \"Not necessarily am I proud of that, but I'm just saying - I do whatever I want and still win,\" he added. A marked-up Haney, 25, said he was \"disappointed\" in his performance. He added: \"I [showed I] was a true champion and I could fight after being knocked down.\"  On the undercard, Belfast's Sean McComb was controversially defeated by light-welterweight Arnold Barboza Jr.  In a world-title eliminator, McComb produced a composed performance with slick footwork and better timing but lost a split decision.  The pair had shared the ring six times as amateurs, with three wins each, but it was underdog Garcia - who missed the weight by 3.2lb -  who stole the show in the pro ranks at the Barclay Center.  He made a blistering start, landing a lead left hook in the first minute as Haney's legs buckled.  'The Dream' recovered well and began to take control, glancing a left hook of his own in the third as American greats Mike Tyson, Evander Holyfield and Roy Jones Jr watched on from ringside.  In a chaotic and eventful seventh, Haney - while his father and trainer Bill was being interviewed in the corner by the TV broadcaster -  hit the canvas for the first time as a pro.  Haney rose to his feet, albeit on shaky legs. An overexuberant Garcia - who had a string quartet perform classical music in his dressing room earlier - was deducted a point seconds later for throwing a punch after the referee asked the boxers to break.  Garcia continued to attack as Haney, holding on, slumped to the canvas twice more later in the round but both were ruled as non-knockdowns.  Just as Haney appeared to regain control, landing solid body shots, Garcia floored the champion in the 10th with his quick hand speed. Haney was hurt again in the final 30 seconds by another Garcia hook.  The sight of Haney on the canvas was becoming all too familiar. He was open for the left hook and Garcia obliged in the 11th.  \"I fell asleep on the left hook. We trained for it but I got in there and fell asleep,\" said Haney, who has also been undisputed champion at lightweight.  \"I gave him a shot, it's only right he gives me a shot back. He didn't make weight, so I'm still the champion. We can run it back.\" Crazy urban myth or legitimate punk-pop conspiracy?: Joanne McNally investigates the Avril Lavigne replacement theory The ultimate soundtrack for your marathon: Harry Judd brings you a selection of uplifting tunes and running advice "

        "text": " Sam Noakes beat Yvan Mendy on points to win the European lightweight title at London's York Hall on Saturday. The victory ends Noakes' run of 13 stoppages in a row as the Englishman was taken 12 rounds for the first time. But the win over France's Mendy capped off a brilliant period for the 26-year-old, who won the Commonwealth and British titles only ten weeks ago. All three judges scored the fight 120-108 for Noakes, who is targeting a world title bout in the next 12 months. Mendy had never been stopped before in his career, and before the first bell had a remarkable 392 rounds under his belt compared to Noakes' 45. It took six rounds for Noakes to give the 38-year-old a taste of his power, staggering Mendy with a right uppercut, despite it landing primarily on the glove of his opponent. Noakes winked at Mendy as the bell came to the rescue and switched up his variety in the second half of the fight, mixing body shots with left hooks and right hands. Garcia misses weight but Haney bout will go ahead Garcia's antics will betray him - Haney Despite the one-sided affair, Mendy took Noakes beyond the ninth round for the first time in his career. He was able to avoid Noakes' power shots and managed to tempt the Kent fighter into a shootout in the final round. Noakes emptied the gas tank in the final 15 seconds, pushing Mendy onto the ropes, but was unable to find the stoppage. \"I knew he was going to be tough, but I was had it in the back of my head I might just get him. But I rushed it,\" Noakes said."

        "description": "The refusal of Amanda Serrano to compete in an undisputed featherweight fight because of issues over 12-round contests is \"frustrating\", says WBC champion Skye Nicolson.",
        "text": " The refusal of Amanda Serrano to compete in an undisputed featherweight fight because of issues over 12-round contests is \"frustrating\", says WBC champion Skye Nicolson. Serrano vacated her WBC title in December after the organisation refused to sanction fights of 12 three-minute rounds. Women's bouts are usually contested over 10 two-minute rounds. The other major governing bodies - the IBF, WBA and WBO - now allow contests of 12 three-minute rounds, and Serrano retained those titles by beating Danila Ramos over 36 minutes last October. Australian fighter Nicolson claimed the WBC featherweight belt earlier this month, comprehensively outpointing Sarah Mahfoud in Las Vegas, and called out Serrano for a unification bout afterwards. Taylor v Serrano rematch to take place in July Serrano, who has 46 wins from 49 professional fights including 30 knockouts, is one of the greatest female fighters of all time. But Nicolson criticised her for her stance on the WBC's rules, adding that the other governing bodies have \"opened up a can of worms\" by allowing longer bouts. \"Of course it is frustrating, all the other females are fighting 10 two-minute rounds, and she's just come out and said, 'this is what I want to do and what I am doing',\" Nicolson told BBC Sport. \"The other sanctioning bodies allowing that has caused a disruption in our division - now there isn't an undisputed champion, it is very hard to make an undisputed fight when she does not want to abide by the rules that are set for everyone. \"I have no problem fighting 12 three-minute rounds, if that was the only way of fighting her I would do it. But I want to be undisputed.\" The 'great talents' aiming to succeed legend Taylor Wilder to face Zhang after signing for Matchroom Nicolson, 28, who has won all 10 of her professional fights, has catapulted herself into the conversation for major bouts following her demolition of Mahfoud. Despite the fight going the distance, the judges scored the fight 100-90 100-90 99-91 in favour of the UK-based boxer. \"I've been on cloud nine,\" Nicolson said of her post-fight emotions. \"I felt very nervous, which I don't usually but I had a lot of pressure on myself, a lot of expectation to put in a good performance. \"I want the other belts, it's not that I want Serrano, it's nothing personal, but she's got the belts. So that's the biggest fight out there for me, and I want to prove I am the best featherweight on the planet.\" Nicolson may have to wait however, with talks over a rematch between Serrano and Katie Taylor advancing. Taylor's promoter Eddie Hearn told BBC Sport last week that a second meeting with Serrano is \"the favourite\" to be confirmed out of the options available, and that talks are at an advanced stage. Nicolson, however, says she does not feel passed over, and that it is up to her to raise her profile to the extent that she cannot be ignored by Serrano. Serrano, aged 35, is entering the latter stages of her career - and Nicolson is determined to catch her before she retires. \"I don't feel hard done by, all I can do is keep proving I am a fight worth making,\" she said. \"That is by beating who they put in front of me, becoming a bigger name, and hopefully the risk v reward for her becomes outweighed before she retires. \"I was completely written off as an opponent for Serrano six months ago, and now it's 50-50 among the public about who would win.\" ABBA's definitive story: How much do you really know about Sweden\u00e2\u0080\u0099s biggest musical export?

        "publication_date": "2024-03-29T08:48:01.000Z",
        "description": "All four episodes of Stable: The Boxing Game will be streamed on ",
        "text": " All four episodes of Stable: The Boxing Game will be streamed on BBC iPlayer from 6am on Saturday, 30 March, and broadcast as double bills on BBC One after Match of the Day on Saturday 30 and Sunday, 31 March. The list of fighters Shane McGuigan has trained reads like a who's who of recent British boxing greats. The son of boxing Hall of Famer, Barry McGuigan, the 36-year-old has mentored a string of world champions - including David Haye, Carl Frampton, George Groves, Chantelle Cameron, Lawrence Okolie, Josh Taylor and Chris Billam-Smith.  In a new four-part BBC One documentary, cameras are allowed special access into the McGuigan gym.  We meet some of the more decorated fighters in the stable - Okolie, Daniel Dubois and Billam-Smith - as well as rising stars such as Adam Azim, Caroline Dubois and Ellie Scotney. The series also offers an interesting insight into the politics of boxing, as Barry and Shane McGuiguan reflect on a bitter split with former fighter Frampton. Here are a few takeaways from the series. How does it feel when two fighters you've trained for years face off against one another for a world title? In a word, \"awkward\". That's how McGuigan describes Billam-Smith's showdown against former stable-mate and WBO champion Okolie last May. During the build-up, Okolie described his opponent at times as a \"friend,\" and at others, a former \"colleague.\" They had both been under McGuigan's tutelage since 2019. During that time, Billam-Smith had to get used to playing second fiddle. It was Okolie who got picked for the 2016 Olympics and he was the one headlining cards whilst both fighters were signed to Matchroom. Billam-Smith, 33, said he had \"a chip\" on his shoulder for years and reveals that it was \"hard to take\" when then-British and Commonwealth cruiserweight champion Okolie joined the gym in 2019. \"It doesn't mean I didn't like Lawrence or disrespected him at all,\" Billam-Smith stressed to BBC Sport. Either way, when Okolie, 31, split with the McGuigans in 2022, it was an opportunity for Billam-Smith to challenge for his belt. And it was the underdog, Billam-Smith, who stunned his former stable-mate in in front of 15,000 fans at Bournemouth's Vitality stadium. Billam-Smith said Okolie texted to congratulate him the day after the fight. Okolie's split is presented in Stable as a mutual one - notwithstanding the fact that McGuigan says he \"always expected\" the former world champion to use the opportunity to \"elevate himself\". However, not everyone has enjoyed such an amicable split from the McGuigans. In 2017, former two-weight world champion Frampton sued former manager Barry for loss of earnings after leaving the gym and McGuigans' Cyclone Promotions.  Frampton tells story of McGuigan split in new book McGuigan lodged a counter-suit for breach of contract. Both parties denied the respective allegations against them and the case was settled out of court. McGuigan, who helped Frampton win world titles at two weights, says he lost a \"best mate\" when the Belfast man left. Of the various successful fighters McGuigan has trained, one of the brightest prospects in recent years is Daniel Dubois. Under McGuigan's guidance the 26-year-old became a big name in the heavyweight division.  When he knocked out American Trevor Bryan in 2022 to win the WBA (Regular) title, it earned Dubois the opportunity to challenge unified champion Oleksandr Usyk last August. However, just three months before that title shot, the Londoner split with McGugian and joined trainer Don Charles. Meanwhile, his younger sister, Caroline, who was also being trained by McGuigan, opted to remain within the stable.  The series finished filming before Daniel's departure, but episode three offers a glimpse inside the family's unique dynamics, with contributions from both siblings as well as head of the family, Stan. The family patriarch home-schooled seven siblings from a three-bed flat in Greenwich and reveals that he formed a plan to turn his eldest son Daniel into a boxer, \"before he was even born\". Caroline, by contrast, had to nag her dad to take her to a gym. He relented reluctantly and took her to Repton boxing club, but for a period they pretended she was a boy called Colin., external In an interesting foreshadowing of the sibling split, Stan talks in one scene about the importance of family, comparing the Dubois' to other boxing dynasties like the Hattons, Benns and Eubanks, saying \"family things are good things,\" before adding, \"hopefully it'll end with a good story\". Adam Azim is one of British boxing's hottest prospects and a new poster-boy for British Asians.  The 21-year-old from Slough is undefeated in 11 fights and won his first pro title last November.  His older brother Hassan, also trained by McGuigan has seven wins on his unbeaten record.  However, while Adam does double training sessions and celebrates wins with backflips, the elder sibling's approach is more measured and careful. Adam talks in episode one about being diagnosed with ADHD, saying he is used the condition \"as a good thing\" by channelling his energy into boxing. McGuigan describes Azim as being \"in a rush to get somewhere\" and the boxer has previously said he hopes to emulate his idol Amir Khan by becoming a world champion by the age of 22. His birthday is in July. Find out more about current and former members of the McGuigan stable - including Ellie Scotney, Anthony Fowler and Robbie Davies Jr - in the series coming to BBC One on Saturday 30 March."

        "description": "Roberto Duran and Dave Radford were from different worlds.",
        "text": " Roberto Duran and Dave Radford were from different worlds. Duran was a champion boxer, considered one of the greatest to ever step into the ring, while Radford, a part-time plasterer from Hemsworth, West Yorkshire, was often fighting in leisure centres and social clubs. Yet in November 1997, a series of unlikely events saw 28-year-old Radford fly to South Africa and fight Duran in front of 10,000 people at the Carousel Casino in Hammanskraal. \"It was a dream come true, you couldn't write it.,\" said Radford on the Sporting Witness podcast. Johnny I'Anson spoke to Radford and his trainer about their experiences for the BBC World Service programme. Listen on BBC Sounds: Sporting Witness - The plasterer who fought a boxing legend Radford was plastering a wall when his trainer James Walker called. \"He said, 'You better sit down, I've got something to tell you, I've got you a fight in Africa,'\" said Radford. Radford's trainer also told him who he would be up against. The reaction was understandable. \"No, no, not the Roberto Duran, he'll kill me.\" At the time, Duran was 46 years old and had been a world champion in four different weight classes. The Panamanian great had the fight in South Africa booked in, but plans had been thrown into chaos when his intended opponent broke an ankle shortly before the bout. Duran's management tried to find a quick replacement to save the contest and Radford got the unlikely call, just days before the planned show. He was picked as organisers wanted someone in the top 10 in Britain. Radford was ninth and willing to step in at short notice. Within hours he was on his way to Manchester Airport to fly to South Africa, but not without a few more surprises. \"Dave's talking to the Spice Girls!\" Walker told his family on a payphone, before the flight. Radford was not only starstruck by Duran but also by boxing legend Marvin Hagler, who was at ringside for the fight. \"When I jumped in the ring, I looked to my left-hand side. Who was sat at the table commentating? Marvelous Marvin Hagler,\" he recalled. \"I'm just thinking, 'I cannot believe what is happening'. I've always wanted to meet him.\" Meeting Hagler would have to wait as Radford was about to fight one of his heroes. Radford said that fighting Duran \"sickened\" him. The man with whom he traded blows, nicknamed 'Hands of Stone', was a superstar boxer in the 1980s. \"He knocked me many a times with head shots but the worst ones was the body shots,\" said Radford. \"I can't really describe what it is, it just wiped everything out of me.\" But Radford was not going to leave without giving a good account of himself. \"I knocked him a few times, it was a good hard right hand I hit him with,\" Radford said. \"I remember knocking his hands back. I'm just thinking to myself, 'I've just rocked Roberto Duran'.\" He felt himself \"running out of energy\" with just 15 seconds left. When the last bell rang, Radford was not thinking about how he had fought his hero but instead how he \"survived\" the fight. Radford lost the fight on points but became a hero. \"At the end of the fight, the crowds were chanting 'Radford, Radford'. It was crazy,\" said Walker. It took a moment for Radford to realise what had happened. \"I just looked at my fists and that's when it hit me... I have gone the distance with one of my heroes,\" said Radford. \"Not only to just meet the guy and shake the man's hand but to fight the guy and then shake the man's hand. It was unbelievable.\" The surprises did not stop there for Radford and his trainer. \"It was chaos,\" said Walker, remembering how the pair were surrounded by crowds at the airport. They were met by promoters Rodney Berman and Cedric Kushner who paid Radford for the match. \"I'm counting out the money, sticking it in every pocket I've got,\" added Walker. The experience for Radford was one of a kind, as the boxer was usually fighting in social clubs, in front of 600 people. \"You got people that really wanted to see a good old scrap,\" he said. \"They'd throw money into the ring, after a fight. The boxers would pick it up and they'd both share the tip.\" Radford retired from boxing the following year, in 1998. He remained friendly with Duran, who paid a visit to West Yorkshire when Radford opened a boxing gym in 2010. BBC World Service's Sporting Witness takes a look at the inside and personal stories of the key moments from sporting history."

Fighting on the undercard of the world-title contest between Leigh Wood and Josh Warrington, Coghill was dropped four times as the fight was halted in the 12th round.  In his BBC Sport column, Coghill reflects on what ended up being his last ever professional fight.  At the age of 28, my boxing career was over. As stupid as it sounds, my last ever professional fight - one which could have ended my life - was the highlight of my career. I was in the meeting room with the doctor and my girlfriend. He shut the door behind him and said: \"I don't really know how to tell you this\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 you've got a bleed on the brain.\" \"Will I be able to fight again?\" I asked, already knowing the answer.  I didn't ask him anything about an operation or what was next. As selfish as it sounds, I wasn't really worried about the injury. I was more worried about boxing.  He said I might need it draining and part of my skull removing. That's when I began to panic. OK, I may not be able to fight again but also I may never walk out of here. I was in a waiting room for two hours, wired up to these machines. They eventually came in and said it was a minimal, controlled bleed and I won't need an operation.  I knew I would never box again but I was grateful that a small kid from a council estate in Hull fought on the biggest stage - in front of 20,000 fans on a world-title undercard and live on DAZN.  That can't be taken away from me. To end on that note, though it's a bitter pill to swallow, makes me proud.   I've not watched the full fight back yet, just the highlights, although I do want to. It might be a bit difficult watching it back but the positive is that I'm here and I'm talking.   I was undefeated in 14 fights but Hopey Price was without a doubt my toughest test. He started well but then slowed down in the second round and I was putting him under pressure, winning the fight. I could feel his shots but they weren't hurting me.  In the sixth round I got a bit carried away and walked on to a two-punch combination. It was just a flash knockdown. I got up, recovered straight away and then waved him on to say 'come on, let's have it'.  There were no headaches. Nothing to suggest what was going to happen to me in the week that followed.  After 10 rounds, despite the knockdown, I was still in the fight. My trainer, Stefy Bull, was telling me I'm two rounds away from winning it.  In the 11th I was boxing well but in the last 10 seconds Price caught me. I fell on to the ropes and he hit me again. That last punch hit the side of my head and I couldn't recover.  Everyone has said he shouldn't have hit me when I was down, but you're in a fight and your adrenaline gets the better of you. I'd have probably done the same thing.  By now I knew I needed a knockout to win the fight. He bombarded me in the 12th round and dropped me twice. The second time, with just 90 seconds of the fight left, it was called off.  At the time I felt like the referee could have let me carry on, to finish the fight on my feet.  But if it had continued I would have had a minute and a half of punishment, and who knows what further damage that could have caused.  So I am thankful for the referee Bob Williams. It was a great decision.  The doctor checked me over when I was sitting on the stool after the fight and again in the dressing room. I felt absolutely fine. I was a bit tired but that's understandable, I had just been fighting for nearly 40 minutes.  When I got to the hotel I had a bit of a headache but nothing which I felt was serious. I was walking normally, talking normally, I knew where I was.   Just two days later I was at an amateur boxing show in Hull to hand out trophies. I even went to the Hull Fair. I was being so active, around loud noises and lights, which my doctor later said could have made the bleed worse.  I booked a little place in Blackpool for a family getaway and I took my nana, mum and sister. I was playing basketball in the amusements with my sister's boyfriend on the Friday and later that night I started to get really bad headaches.  It got worse the next day so I took myself to the hospital. I thought I would be diagnosed with concussion but I ended up being stuck in a hospital in Blackpool for six days. I just wanted to get home but the pain in my head was excruciating.  To be honest, it is all a bit of a shock and probably hasn't fully sunk in.  I had never before suffered from headaches because of boxing. I didn't cut water for the fight - if anything I was underweight. There was no tough sparring.  For anyone who has seen me fight, I've always been a boxer who tries not to get hit. I don't engage in tough fights. I was a hit and move boxer. It's not like I had a career where I'd been in tough wars.  Could it have been prevented? Maybe. But how?  To gain your boxer licence, you have to have annual MRI brain scans. I'd had mine just eight weeks or so ago, and this was my first fight since the scan.   Nobody knows what caused the bleed on the brain. It may have even been a punch nobody has picked up on.  The way I look at it is that it was a freak accident. Nobody caused it. It just happened.  I recently went to a professional boxing event at City Hall in Hull, where I've headlined before, to watch a couple of friends fighting. I was backstage and I was a bit emotional.  But I've got new goals and ambitions which I've written down and I'm positive I'll work towards.  When I was training in Doncaster I set up a little project to train kids from the local estate, and I want to do that now.  Eventually, I'd like to train and manage professional fighters. The support from the boxing world has been incredible and their fundraising will also help me set up a gym in Hull.  I'll admit that training a fighter, having gone through what I have, is scary and I'll need to trust myself.  I'll be building a relationship with someone, putting them into the ring, knowing there is always the possibility of what happened to me.  Knowing when to throw in the towel, to pull my fighter out - that will be a big challenge. But I'll need to trust myself.  But ultimately I want to use my experience to lead my fighters to titles. I couldn't achieve my dream of becoming a champion. Now my new dream is to create champions.  Connor Coghill was speaking to BBC Sport's Kal Sajad"

        "text": " Fighting is in Anthony Joshua's \"bloodline\", according to his cousin Raymond Ajakaye, who lives in the Nigerian town of Sagamu that is the ancestral home of the Joshua family. The town is expected to grind to a halt on Friday when hundreds of people will assemble to watch special screenings of the British boxer's heavyweight contest against Cameroon's Francis Ngannou - to cheer on the man they see as their own. \"It runs in the family, we're all tough people, from my grandad, my uncles and his dad,\" Ajakaye tells BBC Sport Africa. \"We fought through a lot. This is where I would think he got the [boxing] gift from.\" Located near Lagos in south-west Nigeria, Sagamu has a population of around half a million people. Like the country as a whole, that population skews towards the younger age range, meaning many youngsters have found inspiration in Joshua's family heritage and his success in the ring. How to follow Joshua v Ngannou on BBC Sport  Could Joshua v Ngannou winner fight for undisputed title next? Why Nigerians see Joshua as one of their own Such has been his impact, the town has its own Anthony Joshua Fan Club, with thousands of followers on social media, while a street has also been renamed in honour of the 34-year-old Olympic and two-time world heavyweight champion. \"The road was called Cinema Road for many years but it was changed by the government in recognition of his [Joshua's] achievements,\" says Ajakaye. \"We have an office set up here to become a meeting point for all his fans.\" Not only does the road serve as a meeting place for acolytes, but there are also plans in place to build a gym to hunt for the next AJ. Anthony Oluwafemi Olaseni Joshua was born in the UK in October 1989 to a Nigerian mother and a father of Nigerian and Irish descent. Although he has always fought under a British flag, he spent part of his childhood in Nigeria, attending a boarding school, and the influence that Africa - and more specifically Nigeria - has had on him is clear for all to see and hear. Joshua has an outline tattoo of the continent on his right shoulder, with Nigeria's border also highlighted, while he has used the music of Nigerian icons like Burna Boy and Femi Kuti, son of Afrobeat legend Fela Kuti, to accompany him on previous ring-walks. His fights are shown on specially erected screens in front of the palace of the Akarigbo in Sagamu, the Nigerian town's paramount ruler. \"The Joshua family is well known in this town. His mother is from my domain and we are related as cousins,\" one of the town's traditional rulers, Oba Adewale Osiberu tells BBC Sport Africa. \"AJ is level-headed and committed to what he does. He is very humble and doesn't allow his success to get to his head. Beyond that, he loves to connect with his roots. \"We wish him the best and will continue to pray for him.\" Joshua visited the town three years ago as it opened up again following the Covid-19 pandemic, meeting with Osiberu and other members of his fan club. \"We all have a strong connection, though we don't meet regularly and his homecoming has not been frequent due to his career,\" explains Ajakaye. \"He's a kid with a lot of respect and he's well brought up, respecting his elders.\" When Joshua enters the ring for a headline bout, fight nights in Sagamu have become legendary. Kayode Segun-Okeowo, president of the Anthony Joshua Fan Club, says it has become a tradition for the town to come out to cheer on its adopted son. \"The club was established in 2016 and we have a large fan base for Anthony Joshua here,\" he says. \"We have organised live viewing events for most of his fights and organised victory parties for him. \"My expectation for his next fight is positive. Joshua has defeated better boxers. I don't see him [Ngannou] beating our own Anthony Joshua.\" Every time Joshua takes to the ring, the town of Sagamu goes into a frenzy. Friday will be no different as boxing fans and non-boxing fans alike will gather to watch their favourite son. The meeting between Joshua and Ngannou reignites a long-standing sporting rivalry between Nigeria and Cameroon. But for the people in this region of Nigeria, the message is clear - there can only be one winner."

Verstappen senior is a former F1 driver who took up rallying in 2022. He will race on gravel for the first time over more than 62 miles in Wales in a Skoda Fabia RS Rally2. \"We are very happy to come to Wales and the British Rally Championship,\" Verstappen told the BRC website. \"Renaud [Jamoul, co-driver] has done Wales Rally GB several times but for me, these stages will be the first. \"I only started rallying two years ago, but only with tarmac events.  \"After two test sessions in the wintertime in the south of France, we have decided to do our first proper gravel rally and as Renaud has some really good memories in Wales, this rally was looking like the best one to start with. \"We will get some good advice from Tom Cave during our PET [pre-event-test] in Sweet Lamb and we will try to do our best.  \"There is no plan in terms of performance because it will be my first time on gravel but for sure the target is to improve and be as close as possible to the top guys.\" BRC manager Reece Tarren said: \"What a name to add to the already remarkable BRC entry this season. \"We have British, European and World Rally champions on the books this year and now, we have an F1 driver to add to the list.  \"The following that the entire family have is immense and rightly so, they are at the pinnacle of motorsport across the world.\" Llandrindod Wells in mid-Wales will host the ceremonial start of the BRC event with racing taking place the following day. Englishman Chris Ingram and co-driver Alex Kihurani won the opening BR round at the North West Stages on Saturday, 23 March."

        "text": " Northern Ireland's six-time champion Jonathan Rea earned his first points of this year's World Superbike series with an eighth-place finish in race two in Barcelona, which Alvaro Bautista won. Rea, riding for Yamaha this season after switching from Kawasaki, remained without a point after finishing 13th in Sunday morning's sprint race. He ensured he would not leave empty-handed with eight points in race two. Spain's Bautista took victory ahead of Nicolo Bulega in a Ducati one-two. It marked a 60th World Superbike race win for Bautista, who rose to second in the overall standings with his first win of the season. But it is Italian Bulega, 24, who sits top after two rounds with 87 points - 12 ahead of Bautista. Turkey's Toprak Razgatlioglu completed a successful weekend, in which he claimed wins in race one and Sunday's Superpole race, earning another podium place by finishing third in race two. Razgatlioglu earlier took his second win of the weekend by producing a sensational move on the final corner, edging out Andrea Iannone after defending champion Bautista fought from 11th to take the lead at the start of the final lap. British rider Alex Lowes, fifth in the Superpole race, is level with Bautista on 75 points in third after finishing sixth in race two in Barcelona. His twin brother, Sam Lowes, finished 12th to sit 13th in the standings. Rea, who retired after only one lap in Saturday's race one, was unable to get into the top nine points positions after a poor start meant he slipped to 17th place on lap one earlier on Sunday. But, six races into the series, he is at last on the board for Yamaha with his eight points placing him 17th overall. Round three of the World Superbike series takes place in Assen in the Netherlands on 19-21 April.  Can newly-divorced Maxine find love amidst the chaos?

        "text": " Early World Superbike leader Alex Lowes says having his twin brother Sam on the grid with him this season is a \"dream\" that will benefit both riders. Alex claimed Superpole and race two victories in February's opening round of the championship at Phillip Island. His brother Sam swapped the MotoGP paddock, and nine years in the Moto2 class, for World Superbikes this year. \"It's only going to be positive racing against each other,\" British 33-year-old Alex told BBC Radio Lincolnshire. \"It's a dream of ours to be racing together in World Championships and riding on these tracks. \"It's been good to ride together on the track because it was so long ago that we last did it and we have both changed so much. \"Obviously I have the experience of Superbikes and he has won some Grand Prix and and been riding at such a high level.\" Before the opening round of the 2024 season in Australia, it had been more than a decade since the Lincoln-born twins last competed against one another. The last time they were on the same grid regularly was when they raced in the European Superstock 600 series in 2008. And while Alex is a Kawasaki factory rider and Sam is riding for the Marc VDS Ducati team, their brotherly bond will ensure they have a unique dynamic as rivals - from being \"every man for himself trying to beat each other\" to being the most supportive of rivals. \"I'm sure riding together on track we can really help each other,\" Alex said. \"Obviously we are not team-mates, he is on a Ducati and I'm on a Kawasaki, but we are closer than that, so we can certainly help each other a lot. \"During races I won't really think of him any different. It's more in practice sessions, if I'm following him, I'd be more inclined to help him and give him some pointers than other people. \"I know he will do really well this year and our goal, a mini-target, is to share a World Championship podium together.\" "

        "text": " In a sport where many in the paddock are sadly no strangers to tragedy, Dominic Herbertson's keen sense of loss at the deaths of two of his closest friends continues to inspire his involvement. James Cowton died after an incident at the Southern 100 on the Isle of Man in July 2018 and Chrissy Rouse lost his life as a result of a crash at a British Superbike round at Donington Park in October. \"I always think of them, their deaths had a huge impact on me,\" reflected road racer Herbertson when he spoke to BBC Sport NI at this year's North West 200. \"They went racing because they loved it, and it's important that we keep the sport going for those reasons,\" added the 32-year-old. Cowton won a thrilling Supertwins race at the North West in 2018 and his family have helped sponsor Herbertson's road racing efforts since the Yorkshireman's passing. \"James was a good man and a really good friend of mine and when he lost his life at the Southern, his father came up to me and said, 'I want to keep James's name going and I'd like you to race for us'. \"I couldn't say no and I didn't want to say no. That Supertwin race was a race for the ages, it was phenomenal and the man was such a fierce competitor.\" Irwin focused on recovery after 'scary' issues Dunlop sets Superbike pace as NW200 returns Ten riders to watch at the North West 200 Hexham rider Herbertson first struck up a friendship with fellow North East of England man Rouse when they crossed paths at an awards dinner. The pair went on to host the popular Chasin' the Racin' podcast, where they interviewed a range of guests from various disciplines of motorcycle sport. \"I spent a lot of time with Chrissy and we built the podcast together. We were totally chalk and cheese but that's what made the podcast grow. \"The more time I spent with him, the more I respected him and the closer we became as mates. \"I've lost my best mate but his family have lost a son and a brother. I'm still very close to the family and they are going through so much more than I am. \"It has made me think more, not about stopping racing as I want to race forever, but it's made me realise the kind of people you want around you and how important that is.\" Rouse, the 2020 National Superstock 1000cc champion on British short circuits, was just 26 when he passed away in the autumn. Herbertson, who read a tribute at his friend's funeral, was ready to stop the podcast following Chrissy's death, but was persuaded to continue by Rouse's 16-year-old sister Grace. \"I thought, 'why should I continue this without Chrissy?' - we built it together and I felt in a respectful way, let's stop it and have those great memories. \"Nobody would ever replace Chrissy. It's impossible.  \"But then his 16-year-old sister came up to me and said: 'We've got to keep this going - Chrissy loved it and took so much pride in it, and it helps people.' \"People were finding a lot of comfort from it, especially in the situation we went through with Covid. \"I thought, 'how can I not continue?' - but it is very much Grace's pod now.\" Despite growing up in racing paddocks, Herbertson did not ride a motorcycle until he was 21 years old, before following his father Mark into racing in 2010. His first race on public roads was the 2013 Manx Grand Prix, and since then he has gone on to compete at a number of road races including the Isle of Man TT, Southern 100, Scarborough, the Ulster Grand Prix, Armoy and the Macau Grand Prix. He has also taken in short circuit events, but it is 'pure' road racing that is his primary passion. \"The second I went down Bray Hill [at the IOM TT] I knew that I wanted to become a road racer,\" explained Herbertson, a tree surgeon by trade. \"I've had a win round the Mountain Course [the 2018 Junior 350cc Classic TT] but when I go road racing it's about progressing. \"I achieved some top-eight finishes at the TT last year but then I crashed in the Senior TT, and that was 100% my own fault. \"I went through the Glen Helen section thinking I could make that turn and I ran out of a bit of road, too much throttle.\" Herbertson first took part in the North West 200 in 2017 and returned this year to compete on a Superstock Honda supplied by Wilson Craig Racing, but withdrew from the meeting on Wednesday. \"My first impression was that it was mind-blowingly quick. When you have five riders bunched together and we're doing 200mph it's phenomenal,\" he reflected."

BMW rider Razgatlioglu prevailed in an eight-bike battle for the lead at the Dutch circuit. Reigning champion Alvaro Bautista was second and Yahama's Remy Gardner was third.  It has been a disappointing start to life with Yamaha for Rea, 37, who joined the team after ending his successful partnership with Kawassaki at the end of last season. As drizzle started to fall around Assen, Rea and former Kawasaki team-mate Alex Lowes crashed at the first corner with 12 laps remaining.  Rea rejoined to finish in 19th position, but it marks a disappointing end to a weekend in which he qualified on pole position.  As multiple riders battled for the lead - with Gardner, Andrea Locatelli, Bautista and Razgatlioglu all having spells of hitting the front - it was Razgatlioglu who judged the difficult conditions best.  After dropping to seventh, the 2021 champion picked his way through the pack and passed Bautista with six laps to go for a lead he would not relinquish. Championship leader Bautista had to settle for second and Australian Gardner secured his first World Superbikes podium in third.

        "text": " Northern Ireland's William Creighton says he is ready to make the \"big leap\" to WRC2 - the second tier of the World Rally Championship - in Sweden. Creighton is stepping up to WRC2 after winning the Junior WRC title last season. He will drive for M-Sport Ford Fiesta across the season, starting at Rally Sweden from 15-18 February. \"I've no real expectations and I just want to enjoy this one,\" said Creighton. Creighton will lead Ford's charge in WRC2 at Rally Sweden as 25 crews tackle the snow-based event.  The Motorsport Ireland Rally Academy driver said: \"Of course, it's a big leap from the Fiesta Rally3 that we used last year but some things remain relatively similar, so the last week or so has been all about finding out how to adapt my driving to the Rally2 Fiesta and see how to get the most out of myself and the car in the snow\". The Scandinavian trio of Skoda's Oliver Solberg - son of 2003 WRC champion Petter - Toyota's Sami Pajari and Hyundai's Emil Lindholm will be favourites to take victory.  \"There is no doubt that the Fiesta Rally2 is a fantastic car, but Sweden will be all about learning for me,\" Creighton added.  \"The WRC2 category is amazingly strong as it is but then you add the Scandinavians into the mix who drive on this stuff [snow] day in and day out and it becomes tough to fight for positions.  \"So, in reality we are looking to just have a clean and consistent run over the course of the rally and put everything into practice that we have learnt with the tests.\" Motorsport Ireland's Eamonn Kelly will also start his Junior WRC campaign in an ultra-competitive field of 19 cars.  The World Rally Championship have honoured late Irish driver Craig Breen, who passed away in a testing accident in April 2023 at the age of 33. A Junior WRC driver will be recognised with the Craig Breen Spirit of rallying Award for their attitude and dedication to the sport. Breen triumphed in the category in 2011 - known then as the WRC Academy - after a stunning comeback drive at the final round at Rally Wales and the recipient of the award will embody that passion to rallying. Rally Sweden have also honoured Breen by renaming a stage #42 Brattby. Breen declared himself the 'Mayor of Brattby' after posting the fastest time on the stage last year on his way to finishing second. The rally was his final WRC event before his passing in April. "

The US media conglomerate, which took control of F1 in 2017, has purchased the motorbike series from Spanish company Dorna Sports, which has owned MotoGP since 1992.  The deal will see Liberty acquire about 86% of Dorna, with Dorna's management retaining the rest of the business. It is expected to be officially completed by the end of the year.  Greg Maffei, Liberty Media president and chief executive officer, said the company was \"thrilled\" to be expanding its live sports portfolio.  He added: \"MotoGP is a global league with a loyal, enthusiastic fan base, captivating racing and a highly cash flow generative financial profile. \"The business has significant upside, and we intend to grow the sport for MotoGP fans, teams, commercial partners and our shareholders.\" Dorna chief executive officer Carmelo Ezpeleta said Liberty has an \"incredible track record in developing sports assets\".  \"We are proud of the global sport we've grown, and this transaction is a testament to the value of the sport today and its growth potential,\" Ezpeleta added.  The first MotoGP season took place in 1949 with just six rounds of racing but has now grown into 20-grands prix campaign, covering five continents.  Spanish rider Jorge Martin is top of this year's championship on 60 points followed by Brad Binder of South Africa on 42 points. "

        "text": " For Jordan Bird, learning the ropes of running a motorcycle racing team has been a way of life. The daughter of former PBM Racing team boss Paul Bird has, in her own words, been \"involved forever\" with the record nine-time British Superbike champions. The death of her dad on 1 September 2023, aged 56, saw Jordan and her twin brother Frank take over the reins of the Ducati team and now they are preparing for their first full season in charge of the decorated BSB outfit. The team will field just one rider in 2024 - Northern Ireland's Glenn Irwin, who finished just half a point behind team-mate Tommy Bridewell in a thrilling climax to last year's series. \"It's been a bit of a nightmare really, trying to run a race team, grieving the loss of my father, probate, all the different factors, but it was never an option not to do this [run a BSB team again in 2024],\" Jordan told BBC Sport. \"It's something I've always wanted to do, along with my brother, to make it happen. Now we've got it over the line, we can start doing the good bits. \"I've been involved forever, gone along to every race with my dad. I've never known anything different. \"I took a bit of a back seat where I could just see how things happened and now really it's all on my shoulders. \"I've had good teachers and plenty of years to watch and learn.\" Irwin to ride for PBM Ducati in 2024 BSB series and NW200 The PBM team's British titles have been achieved by Shane Byrne (5), Steve Hislop, Scott Redding, Josh Brookes and Bridewell. The outfit have also competed in two-wheel motorsport in World Superbikes with Kawasaki and MotoGP on an Aprilia machine, won races at the Isle of Man TT with the likes of Joey Dunlop, John McGuinness and Ian Hutchinson, as well as taking part in four-wheel motorsport. Jordan is relatively unfazed, however, by the prospect of trying to emulate some of the success achieved by her late dad's team over recent decades. \"There's pressure, but it's good pressure, you need pressure and you thrive on it. I feel it but it's the thing that drives you forward. \"Ducati are great. They have looked after us for years and have given us as much as they can, both Ducati UK and Ducati Corse. I would never change manufacturer. It's the best bike on the grid in BSB. \"This is a new project, we're kind of calling it PBM 2.0. I fully expect us to carry on as we would if my dad was still here. \"We go racing to win races and win championships and that's what we expect to do.\" The new PBM team will also participate at the North West 200 road race in May as Irwin attempts to become the most successful rider ever at the event. \"We're really looking forward to it [the NW200]. It was one of my dad's favourite events so we're aiming to achieve some more success. That would be nice. \"Glenn's great. He's been unbelievable with us because there has been a lot of uncertainty at one point for him. \"He said it was a no-brainer to stay with us, and for us I would never have signed anybody else for BSB. \"Going to the North West was an absolute no-brainer too. Glenn is part of the furniture now. I think we are stuck with each other.\" Jordan explains that her grief at the loss of her father was helped by the outpouring of support she and the other family members received. \"I was really grateful. It made a really tough time a bit more bearable to know that a lot of people loved my dad, not just us. \"I knew my dad was a legend - the results and the things he has done speak for themselves. \"When you see how many people he gave a leg up to. The team has a massive following and a lot of that was down to my dad.\" The 2024 series begins at a new venue in Navarro, Spain, this weekend."

        "text": " Elfyn Evans finished second at Rally Croatia, with Toyota team-mate Sebastien Ogier snatching victory on a dramatic final day. Welshman Evans and World Rally Championship (WRC) leader Thierry Neuville were locked in a duel for victory during Friday and Saturday. However, both hit a grass bank on Sunday's stage 18, gifting victory to Ogier by 9.7 seconds. \"It's a feeling of disappointment with the spin and tyre choice,\" said Evans. \"It's not ideal, but you have to be in it to try, it's been a good weekend, but disappointed with today.\" Neuville finished third and remains six points ahead of Evans in the championship, both collecting 19 points from the weekend. Under this season's new WRC scoring system Neuville collected 18 points as leader of the rally at the end of Saturday, plus a further one point for his Sunday performance. Evans scored 15+3 along with an extra bonus point from the final power stage. Both were outscored by Ott Tanak, who despite finishing a distant fourth banked 20 points, only one fewer than rally-winner Ogier. For the French eight-time world champion it was a 59th career win and despite competing only part-time on this year's calendar he is now fifth overall. \"We knew coming here start position would be an issue and it would be difficult,\" said Ogier. \"We never gave up and kept the pressure on for the whole weekend. It's good to get the win for the team.\" Ogier's success also provided the Frenchman with his 100th WRC podium place. \"It's huge numbers,\" he added.  \"Who would have thought that 15 years ago? So I enjoy every moment, I enjoy every opportunity I have to still drive these cars. It's nice to see that we still have some speed.\" Round five of the 13-race WRC series stays in Europe with the Rally de Portugal from 9-12 May. 1. Thierry Neuville (Belgium) Hyundai, 86 points 2. Elfyn Evans (Great Britain) Toyota, 80 points 3. Adrien Fourmaux (France) Ford, 59 points 4. Ott Tanak (Estonia) Hyundai, 53 points 5. Sebastien Ogier (France) Toyota, 45 points 6.

        "text": " Motorsport Ireland's bid to host the World Rally Championship in a three-year deal from 2025 has fallen through. Organisers were not able to meet the deadline to obtain the necessary funding set by WRC officials. The Irish government said it would need \"at least six months\" to assess and analyse the proposal. \"I am saddened that it has come to this but unfortunately, we are left with no option,\" said Motorsport Ireland president Aiden Harper. Waterford - the home county of late Irish WRC driver Craig Breen - Limerick and Kerry were set to alternate as host locations over three years, starting from 2025. Harper said all three bids were \"exceptional\" and \"inseparable\" after inspection. When launching Rally Ireland's bid, Motorsport Ireland were asking for an investment of 15m euros over three years for a return of 300m euros. Location for Rally Ireland WRC bid to be announced 'Have fun, life is short' - Remembering Craig Breen The World Rally Championship last came to Ireland in 2007 and 2009 - with Sebastien Loeb winning both events and Harper added that \"hopefully we will be in a position to revisit this magnificent opportunity in the future\". \"We always stated that the FIA World Rally Championship could only come to Ireland with the financial support of government while always being aware that the funding may not be forthcoming,\" added Harper.  \"It is a great shame to have to hand this great opportunity, and the economic benefit it would bring, over to another awaiting country.\" The bid comes after a number of unsuccessful attempts to bring the WRC to Northern Ireland in recent years.  Four previous bids to bring rallying's premier series to Northern Ireland - in 2020, 2021, 2022 and 2024 - have failed, largely because of the Covid-19 pandemic and subsequent deadlines for funding with the lack of a devolved government at Stormont.  Simon Larkin, the WRC's event director had told BBC Sport in February 2023 that WRC officials were \"100% behind\" having Rally Northern Ireland on the 2024 calendar. However, with continued delays surrounding a bid north of the Irish border, attentions turned to Rally Ireland's bid to make a return to the calendar but that too has fallen through."

        "text": " Britain's leading female racing driver says she still receives insults about her gender. Jamie Chadwick, who now races in America's Indy NXT series, once felt she had to ignore sexist comments in order to fit in. Now in a bid to encourage more young women into motorsport, she has launched a female karting championship. \"I get negative comments all of the time [about gender],\" Chadwick, 25, told BBC Sport.  \"If I don't have a good year, I don't want that to be reflected on my gender. I don't want that to be because I'm a woman.  \"I want to create a community where girls can feel comfortable and safe and enjoy karting.\" The winner of the new competition will receive financial help and mentorship from the three-time champion of racing's W Series. Chadwick, a Williams F1 Racing Academy driver, is not used to starting at the back of a grid but at Sandown Park in Surrey she found herself behind 21 others. However, this was not an official race, but the launch of an opportunity for women and girls to compete in an all-female series which she has put her name to.  The competition will see eight races across three different Daytona tracks in England at Sandown, Milton Keynes and Tamworth. Emma Rabbage crossed the line in fourth place in Surrey. \"There is prejudice against females,\" she said. \"On some of the tracks I've been to there have been comments towards me, it knocks your confidence.  \"It's a male-dominated sport, it can be quite an intimidating environment.\" A report last year by More Than Equal, an organisation co-founded by ex-Formula 1 driver David Coulthard, found just 13% of those participating in karting are female, a statistic which drops to 7% in Formula and GT racing. Amelia Charlesworth was another of those racing in Surrey. \"Whenever we go to tracks, I'll be the only female driver, that's indoor, outdoor, whatever,\" said Charlesworth. \"A day like this is so good to have other females you can connect with. Men drive a lot more aggressively, they are stronger and push it a lot more on corners, but I think women can be smarter and figure out which lines to take in different way.\" While a woman has not competed in Formula 1 in almost 50 years, Chadwick said she would love to race at that level.  However, she believes that women face a physical disadvantage in feeder series Formula 2 and Formula 3 where cars are still without power steering. Ultimately, though, Chadwick has no doubt it is a numbers game. \"There's just so few women starting in the sport, naturally when you filter through to the top you have one female driver in F3 and none in F2,\" she said. \"We need to do all we can do we can to create more visibility for women at the highest level of the sport to try and encourage more young girls to start in the first place.\" Like Chadwick, Sophie Norbury followed her brothers' love of motorsport before finding herself captivating by karting. \"Being a woman in karting has helped build confidence, not just in karting but my confidence as a person,\" she added. \"It doesn't matter about anybody else once you put your helmet on.\" The man of the moment...: Rick Astley performs his hits and a cover of Olivia Rodrigo at Media Vale How Trump's golf dream turned into a nightmare...: The controversial development in Aberdeenshire was greenlit with shocking consequences"

        "text": " Nicholas Spinelli won on his World Superbike debut after an inspired tyre choice in a dramatic, red-flagged wet-dry opener at Assen. Spinelli, who was deputising for the injured Ducati rider Danilo Petrucci, built up a 25-second led after selecting wet tyres on the damp Dutch circuit. The rest of the grid, who selected dry tyres, struggled in the early stages but began to catch the 22-year-old Italian. Just when it looked like Toprak Razgatlioglu would pounce on Spinelli, the red flag was shown. With just six laps remaining, race direction declared the race would not be restarted with oil on the circuit.  BMW rider Razgatlioglu finished second, ahead of reigning champion Alvaro Bautista. Northern Ireland's Jonathan Rea, who started from pole position on his Yamaha, was classified in sixth. After a sensational debut win, in which fortune favoured Spinelli's brave tyre choice, the Italian rider struggled to sum up his victory. \"It's incredible,\" Spinelli told Eurosport after his sensational win. \"The last lap the gap was small but when I saw the red flag, I was like 'wow, I win'.\"  Spinelli, who started in 11th, held a 25-second lead after four laps as he picked his way through the order in the wet conditions.  The circuit continued to dry as the race progressed and the chasing pack, led by Bautista, began to eat into Spinelli's lead, which dropped to 18 seconds with 11 laps to go. The advantage dropped further to nine seconds with nine laps to go as the slick-shod runners began to run at times four seconds quicker per lap than Spinelli. Razgatlioglu made a forceful move on Bautista heading into the final chicane to lead the charge with seven laps remaining. That proved to be decisive, as the race was stopped on the following lap just as the 2021 champion looked to make a move on Spinelli.  \"It was a strange race but I really enjoyed it,\" said Razgatlioglu.  \"Everyone was sliding looking for the good line. If we had one more lap, I was maybe winning but I am happy.\" There was disappointment for Rea after he fell back after starting from pole, but the six-time champion has another opportunity in the Superpole race and second feature race on Sunday. World Superbike Championship, Assen - Race One 1. Nicholas Spinelli (Ducati) 2. Toprak Razgatlioglu (BMW) + 1.9 seconds 3. Alvaro Bautista (Ducati) +2.0 4. Remy Gardner (Yamaha) +4.8 5.

The 29-year-old, who won the sprint race on Saturday, started the main event in pole position but a horror start saw him drop into 11th place after the first lap. Teenage rookie Pedro Acosta took second place and Enea Bastianini was third. Championship leader Jorge Martin finished fourth. During the course of the race there were several lead changes, with Acosta taking to the front from the start. The win from Aprilia's Vinales means he is the first rider to take victory in a Sunday race with three different manufacturers - having won with Suzuki and Yamaha in the past. \"I was feeling everyone pushing me,\" he said. \"It was spectacular. What can I say? History made. I'm dreaming. \"I'm super happy... I don't know how many overtakes I did!\" Martin's lead in the riders' standings stands at 21 points after three race weekends, with Bastianini in second place and Vinales three points further back."

        "text": " Women struggle to progress to the higher echelons of motorsport partly because of problems raising funding based on prejudice, a study has found. More Than Equal, an organisation co-founded by ex-Formula 1 driver David Coulthard, said this was a key barrier to women making it to F1. Other obstacles included the lack of female-specific training, too few role models, and mechanical challenges. The study found female participation in motorsport is in the region of 10%. But it also discovered that there was no global participation data for women in motorsport, which chief executive Alison Donnelly, who formerly worked for Sport England, said was a surprise. F1 has welcomed the report and said it is \"committed to increasing opportunity and access to the sport for everyone\". The study says: \"The cost of competing is a universal challenge to both men and women, but too few investors and sponsors are willing to take a chance on female drivers early in their careers, preventing their progress at crucial periods.\" Donnelly said: \"A lot of the female drivers we spoke to said: 'I'm spending an awful lot of time trying to drum up investment. And I can't get on to track and into cars because I haven't got that investment.'  \"If you had two drivers, male and female, aged, let's say, 14, both doing really well, same trajectory and results, and they both pitched to a sponsor or brand or team, he is just so much more likely to be backed because everybody can see the trajectory for him if he is good enough - off you go, along the path into F1 if you're good enough. \"That hasn't happened for such a long time for a female driver that what [women drivers] are saying is: 'Nobody will back us, it's just too much of a risk and it's a lot of money.' \"The sport needs to do a much better job of selling to sponsors and brands: 'This is why it's important to invest in women; here's what will happen at the end.'\" Donnelly said the new F1 Academy, established this year for young female drivers, was \"beneficial because it is giving track time to girls at a very important time of their development\". The study found that karting, the category in which all top drivers cut their teeth, accounts for 40% of female participation in all motorsport, but even there women and girls are only 13% of participants. By the time drivers progress to formula and GT racing, that drops to 7%. In the top categories of the sport, the ratio reduces again to only 4%. Stereotyping or negative perceptions about women's ability to drive fast or compete physically are another barrier, as are women and girls encountering a \"culture [that is] unwelcoming or inappropriate\". The mechanical barriers include the lack of power steering in the categories on the route to F1, which does use steering assistance. This collection of obstacles leads to female drivers dropping out of the sport much earlier than males, the study said. Female careers last on average between one and five years, whereas male ones are more likely to last more than 10 years. The performance group Hintsa, which is renowned for providing physical trainers for about half the F1 drivers, found that there was \"no evidence that there are physical or psychological barriers in preventing women from reaching the top of the sport if given the appropriate support and training\", the study said. Hintsa, which is working with More Than Equal, says the benchmark physical data required for an athlete to compete in F1 is achievable by women. But it said that all motorsport-oriented physical and psychological training was based on men, and that women needed to be trained in a gender-appropriate and age-specific way. The study found that there was an emerging younger, female fanbase and that fans want to see direct competition between women and men, but they perceived motorsport to be 20th out of 21 listed sports in terms of equality, diversity and inclusion. Only 51% of fans knew for certain that women were allowed to compete in F1, with 24% saying they might be allowed, 13% that they could not and 21% saying they did not know. Donnelly said More Than Equal had presented the results of the survey to governing body the FIA. \"They were incredibly supportive and they recognised the role they had to play,\" she said. \"They are a hugely important and powerful lever. Let's see where we get to in terms of the new few years but we were really pleased with the reaction we had there and their interest in growing the sport.\" More than Equal intends to identify emerging female drivers and help them with commercial opportunities and a support programme to progress through the motorsport categories towards F1. Donnelly added: \"If we do the job well, what will start to emerge is a cohort of female drivers who emerge having trained better than ever before.\" Responding to the study, F1 said: \"We welcome the findings of the report that provide another insightful contribution to this important matter. F1 is committed to increasing opportunity and access to the sport for everyone and our F1 Academy is a clear example of our investment and determination to increase access not only focussed on drivers but other roles in motorsport. \"Alongside this we continue to push on increasing female representation across our own business and the wider sport. A lot of work has been undertaken to improve the situation, but we all agree more must be done and we will continue to make progress.\" The FIA said it had been collaborating with More Than Equal, welcomed the research and \"saw benefit in having access to the data\" it had discovered. It said it would ensure it was \"contributing to the next steps in this project\" in tandem with its own Girls On Track Rising Stars programme which it runs in partnership with the Ferrari Driver Academy."

        "description": "Gil de Ferran was a fantastic racing driver: winner of the Indianapolis 500, two-time Indycar champion and holder of the world closed-course speed record.",
        "text": " Gil de Ferran was a fantastic racing driver: winner of the Indianapolis 500, two-time Indycar champion and holder of the world closed-course speed record. But he was respected throughout motorsport just as much for being a wonderful person. De Ferran - as his great friend and mentor, the US motorsport titan Roger Penske said on hearing of his death from a heart attack at the age of 56 - was \"class personified\". Highly intelligent, eloquent in the extreme, the Brazilian's insights and expertise were valued across the sport. None more so than by this writer. I have been fortunate to call De Ferran a friend since we first met more than 30 years ago, and time and again I have turned to him for understanding and knowledge.  Of infinitely more importance, so did the sport's luminaries.  When McLaren needed someone to help guide Fernando Alonso through the intricacies of Indianapolis when the two-time world champion was embarking on his rookie experience there in 2017, it was De Ferran to whom they turned. De Ferran was there as a sounding board throughout Alonso's month of May. The Brazilian was wowed by Alonso's talent; Alonso was just as impressed by De Ferran's calm, thoughtful guidance. They became firm friends. From there, De Ferran became McLaren sporting director and was one of the key insiders instrumental in guiding the team back towards the front.  That relationship came to its natural end in 2021. But after McLaren again slipped from competitiveness through 2022, leading to the appointment of Andrea Stella as team principal in December last year, they again turned to De Ferran. It was at the Miami Grand Prix in May this year that this came to light. I hadn't actually seen that De Ferran was there initially - he was a discreet presence in his civvies - but I bumped into his daughter Anna, who told me he was back working with the team. She immediately realised she probably shouldn't have said anything, but we laughed about it, figured he wouldn't mind too much, and conspired not to tell Gil about her slip-up.  \"We call him the Team Doctor,\" she said, the joke not hiding the inherent truth of his new role as a consultant employed to help fix McLaren's problems.  I never told Gil his daughter was the source who enabled me to break the story of his return to F1 to the world. I was waiting for the right time. I knew he'd laugh about it. He laughed about so much. Now I wish I had. McLaren were one of the stories of last season as they jumped from lower-midfield to the front mid-season. De Ferran's presence was low key - he preferred it that way. But for Stella, his role was invaluable. \"Gil, most people know him as a champion in Indycar and so on,\" Stella said, \"but personally I know him for being somebody incredibly competent in motorsport, Formula 1, strategic approach, people coaching.  \"When somebody in the team has a conversation with Gil, they always come out quite inspired and like: 'Ah, I think I understand now better what I have to do.' Or with ideas: 'I think I have a concept to work on now.'\" De Ferran was a warm and friendly presence. We first met in the back of the Paul Stewart Racing transporter at the British Grand Prix Formula 3 race in 1992. De Ferran was romping to the title that year, but he'd had a bad afternoon in the rain. Still he was charming and welcoming. We hit it off immediately. A while later, he invited me and another journalist to dinner at his house in Cobham in Surrey, with his then-girlfriend Angela, soon to become his wife, and David Coulthard, a friend and rival. I covered his Formula 3000 seasons in 1993 and 1994, in the second of which he came so close to winning the title. When the big F1 opportunity didn't come, he turned to America, and I was in Miami for his first IndyCar race. He was immediately quick. Driving for the unheralded Hall and then Walker teams for the next five years, he was a regular contender, but it was in 2000 that his big breakthrough came, when he was signed by the Penske team - the equivalent in Indycars to Mercedes or Red Bull now in F1. He was champion in both the next two seasons, and among his achievements was the fastest lap in motorsport history - when he took pole at California's Fontana Speedway at an average of 241.428 mph. Early in 2003, De Ferran suffered a huge accident at the Phoenix oval and broke his back. He returned a few weeks later for the Indy 500. Initially, it did not go well.  He once told me that qualifying at Indianapolis is \"like driving on ice at 230mph\". Back out there for his first day after his injury, he was terrified and found he could not drive as he had. He went back to the hotel that night thinking he'd have to retire.  But he decided to try again the next day, and slowly the feeling came back. Later in the week, he qualified 10th and he went on to win the race, holding off team-mate Helio Castroneves by 0.229 seconds in a six-lap sprint to the flag after a late caution period. It was the highest point of an illustrious career, and he retired at the end of the season.  De Ferran went on to be Honda's sporting director in F1 in 2006, and ran and raced for his own team in sportscar racing in the US. Not the most well-known name outside the industry, he was deeply respected throughout motorsport, especially in America.  When McLaren completely messed up Alonso's return to Indy in 2019, arriving unprepared and making a series of errors with the car, it was De Ferran who went around the paddock asking rivals for help and advice, gathering information on set-up, borrowing parts, in an ultimately fruitless attempt to sort it out.  \"I'm at a loss for words,\" Alonso wrote on Saturday on social media. \"It's a very sad day. Thank you for the moments we shared, for wholeheartedly teaching me how to race on ovals, and for the countless memories we created together. We will miss you, Gil.\" Amen to that. I'm writing this through tears, and can only imagine what Angela, Anna and her brother Luke are going through. Hopefully they can find some comfort in their darkest hours in the impact their husband and father made across the motorsport world, reflected in the warmth of the tributes that have flooded in since the awful news broke."

Sometimes like a huge tree snapping in half. Occasionally, if you're close enough, it rattles your rib cage. Curiously, it doesn't register on television coverage, but it is loud. Very loud. It is part of motorsport's majesty. Whether it is part of its future, though, is another thing. The sound of fuel frying on metal seems to many to be increasingly out of step with a warming world, in which climate consciousness is rising with the mercury. At Le Mans, engine overrun drowns out a backing track of thumping house music, fireworks and drunken roars. About 300,000 people flock to north-west France for this annual Glastonbury for petrolheads, with the hardest core collecting around the Dunlop Curve to watch the action. The headline act, as ever, is the 24 Hours of Le Mans race. Over the course of a day and night, three-strong driver teams battle fatigue and the field to steer their aggressive prototype racing machine towards one of the biggest prizes in motorsport. This year marks 100 years since the race's first staging. For a while, though, it seemed likely to limp past the landmark. With the prohibitive costs of competition and the race's old-school image apparently out of time, Toyota had been the only top-level manufacturer competing in recent years, effectively racing themselves. The glory days, epitomised by the 1971 film Le Mans - in which actor Steve McQueen broods and Porsches and Ferraris battle under banners advertising oil and cigarettes - seemed gone for good. The organisers faced a dilemma: how to tap a rich past while making the race relevant once again. The answer lay in the rule book. \"These new regulations permit car manufacturers to have freedom of design and now we have fantastic cars,\" says World Endurance Championship CEO Frederic Lequien. \"It's a return to the history of Ferrari competing against Peugeot, Porsche and Cadillac. We have the best car manufacturers in the world. Never in history has endurance racing been so bright.\" Looser restrictions have given rise to hypercars - beautiful evolutions of sportscars of the past, with each company free to follow a philosophy and field statement-making models, something that is far harder to do in Formula 1 and Formula E, where largely identikit cars fill the grid. Lining up for this year's season are a sleek Porsche, General Motors' Cadillac, which sounds like a muscle car on steroids, and Peugeot's masterpiece, the 9X8 - a rear wing-less, childhood dream of a design. But this revival - which saw the race sold out two weeks after going on sale - is led by Ferrari, who have returned to Le Mans after 50 years away, adding to their already exhaustive F1 schedule. \"We are very, very busy, but very happy,\" says Antonello Coletta, Ferrari's head of GT sport. \"We come back to the pinnacle of endurance in the most important category - hypercar - with less time in respect to the other competitors, but we are super happy. \"Le Mans is the most important race in the world.\" Coletta is part of a new mould of Ferrari leaders. Gone are the Gucci socks and blazers. He reflects a more business-like approach, and you can hear it in his words. He says that many parts of the 499P - which, like all good Ferraris, is beautiful, but hard to manage - are being tested for use on road cars. The most important component isn't part of the 499P's sweeping bodywork, however. It is hidden away, deep in the engine. And it is the innovation, maybe more than any other, that is critical for Le Mans' future. At this year's race all 62 cars, including the many privateer entries, run on a sustainable fuel made from vineyard grape skin waste.  The wine industry's residue is transformed into ethanol, then converted into useable fuel. Its makers say it reduces carbon dioxide emissions by 65%. It is a very French solution to a global problem. F1's innovations tend to take longer to arrive on the road, but their direction of travel is the same. Like Le Mans, F1 is keen to show there is an alternative to electric cars, and has promised to run on its own 100% sustainable fuel, external for 2026. For the moment, though, Le Mans is the most powerful example yet for manufacturers as they advocate for a diversity of ways to fuel the future. Combined with Ferrari's super-efficient engine, which uses far less fuel for just as much power, there is a modern, more frugal face for a storied race. Could the present for Le Mans also be the future for the man in the street? Certainly some of the arguments put forward by the race's supporters appear to be having an effect. The European Union (EU) is reportedly close to amending a proposed plan to outlaw the sale of all new combustion-powered cars by 2035. Instead of electric-only cars, it apparently intends to allow the manufacture of new models that run off carbon-neutral fuel., external The possible move has been criticised by environmental groups,, external who argue that carbon-neutral fuels are unproven, expensive to produce and a costly distraction from the most effective route to decarbonising road transport. \"I don't want anyone to think we're anti-electric. Far from it,\" says F1 technical head Pat Symonds, who is spending his 70th birthday visiting Le Mans for the first time. \"In an urban environment an electric vehicle is a very good solution to many problems. \"But, equally, in other arenas and other territories an electric vehicle isn't the perfect answer.  \"In the race to reduce carbon emissions and tackle global warming - something dear to my heart, believe me - too many governments around the world say, 'here is solution we want you to adopt' and engineers say 'OK, it's a good solution but not the only solution'. \"We've seen this change recently since February in the EU, which is leading to them recognising the value of sustainable fuels, and I think we'll see that worldwide.\" In the thick forest next to the famous Mulsanne straight at Le Mans, you can hear the distant drone of the engines held in the tall trees. It's a dream-like experience at night, a constant churn of bright headlights and raw sound. In the oppressive heat of a Le Mans summer day, the soft moss saps energy from the air. Mulsanne has been sanitised since Ferrari last raced here as a works team - two chicanes slow the pace to help reduce the chance of a car losing its downforce load and, as they have in the past, taking off like an aeroplane and landing in the trees. It is 10 years since the race saw its most recent fatality when Dane Allan Simonsen crashed his Aston Martin at the corner preceding Mulsanne, Tertre Rouge. His car hit a tree behind the barrier, just minutes into the race. \"On every driver's licence it says motorsport is dangerous,\" Ferrari's James Calado muses in the team's huge hospitality suite. \"We realise the danger, but in all honesty the risk isn't high if you compare it to bikes on the Isle of Man. It's not even 0.1% of the danger of what those boys are doing. \"Occasionally bad accidents can happen - normally fluke. I don't want to jinx it, but cars are super safe - you can have a big impact and the car will be fully intact.\" Motorsport has cleaned up its safety record since Le Mans' grimy glory days. Given sustainable fuels still release particulates such as toxic nitrogen dioxide and electric cars soak up power from the grid, there is a way to go before the same can be said for its sustainability credentials. \"As a driver my job is to drive the car and do the best I can,\" says Calado. \"I'm all for sustainability. It's difficult to know what's going to happen in the future. The whole world needs to make a difference and we will do everything we can to help.\" Calado, Britain's most high-profile factory Ferrari driver since Nigel Mansell in the late 1980s, acknowledges the power that Le Mans has as a stage, both for a race and, potentially, for bigger questions that affect us all. \"It is magical,\" he adds with a smile when talking about driving in the middle of the night. \"The fans never go away\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 it's three or four in morning and you can still see and smell the barbecues when you are in the car. \"You smell everything - the sparks when a car scrapes the ground, and we get dust in our eyes where the visor's open.\"  It's an elemental experience. Tired drivers feel the aches, taste the dirt and smell the fumes. For Calado and Ferrari, the weekend also finished with the sight of the chequered flag and a landmark victory to cap off the marque's comeback to Le Mans. And the signature sound, for better or worse, remained the same as ever - the crackle of engine overrun."

Ryu leads on 11 under heading into the final day, with American Korda, who is bidding to equal the LPGA record of five victories in five consecutive starts, one shot behind. Canada's Brooke Henderson is also tied for second on 10 under. Round three concluded early on Sunday after storms delayed play on Saturday. Thailand's Atthaya Thitikul led Korda and Henderson, who played a stellar round of eight under through her first 17 holes, by one shot on 11 under when play was stopped in the first major of the year. But Thitikul now sits tied-third at eight under, along with South Korea's Im Jin-hee and Sweden's Maja Stark. Success for 25-year-old Korda would see her join Nancy Lopez (1978) and Annika Sorenstam (2005) as the only players to achieve the feat of winning five consecutive LPGA events. Scotland's Gemma Dryburgh and England's Jodi Shadoff lead the British contingent on four under, with English amateur Lottie Woad, who won the Augusta National Women's Amateur earlier this month, a shot further back.  England's Georgia Hall and Charley Hull are one under."

        "text": " For LIV Golf it was the perfect storm. Hurricane force winds swept away Sunday's final round of the Pebble Beach Pro-Am, clearing an unencumbered view of the climax of the breakaway tour's opening tournament of the year. So convenient for them was the curtailment of the PGA Tour's initial Signature Event, it made one wonder whether Saudi Arabia had bought the weather as well. Viewers seeking their usual Sunday golf fix were left with no alternative than to access LIV's season opener in Mayakoba, which was eventually won at the fourth extra hole in near darkness by Chile's Joaquin Niemann. And, to be fair, for many fans it might have been a close run choice of what to watch, even if the $20m Pebble Beach competition had been able to run its full 72-hole course. Which would you opt for - LIV's offering of Niemann muscling in to defeat major winning Spaniards Jon Rahm and Sergio Garcia or US Open winner Wyndham Clark trying to hold off Ludvig Aberg and Matthieu Pavon on the Californian coast? The latter was being played at an iconic venue on the Californian coast, but one that had been brought to its knees by Clark's extraordinary 60 on Saturday. The former was a $25m shootout on a Greg Norman designed resort course in Mexico, where Niemann had carded a first round 59. In both events there was some sensational golf, but nothing better illustrates the madness of the modern game than the fact that a total of 134 golfers (80 in the US, 54 on LIV) competed last week for a total of $45m, with no cut at either competition. When tournaments of such limited stature yield an average take home pay of $336,000 per man, we can easily understand why so many people are now saying that men's professional golf has become utterly divorced from reality. Clark was crowned the winner at Pebble Beach because the final round was rendered impossible, while the Mexico tournament provided an engaging climax for those who accessed the coverage. Rahm sought to start repaying the hundreds of millions he pocketed for his close season switch by charging into contention. A potential showdown with his former Ryder Cup partner Garcia was enough to entice me to stream the finale. The website page suggested I was one of around 29,000 watching the action. It was decent, welcoming coverage. The commentary sought to sell the tournament to a wider audience rather than the usual narrow-casting where traditional golf networks assume that everyone watching is already a golfer. Caddies wore microphones, and the chat with their players was enlightening. Refreshingly, it felt as though the viewer was being put first. At least, that was my impression. Is it being overly optimistic to suggest that the competition between tours might ultimately lead to a better overall product for the fan? That appears the only upside from the current mess, one that appears no nearer to untangling as LIV embarks on its third season. Neither champion from last weekend could claim to have beaten the best field in the world because both circuits are diluted by division. And the latest developments bring us no nearer to a resolution - quite the opposite, it seems. The PGA Tour is emboldened by the $1.5bn investment with the Strategic Sport Group that was announced last week. Going forward, they might also attract cash from the Saudi Public Investment Fund (PIF) that backs LIV. But PGA Tour Policy Board member Jordan Spieth reckons they do not need Saudi money, while the man he replaced on the board, Rory McIlroy, insists that this Middle Eastern influence is essential. McIlroy is reported to have left a WhatsApp group of leading players. It appears he has had enough of the endless wrangling. The Northern Irishman argues that a deal with PIF is vital for the game to reunite.  Meanwhile, the US Department of Justice is continuing to insist any arrangement with PIF would need to be formally scrutinised - meaning big delays even if agreement is found.   And where is the Wentworth-based DP World Tour in all of this? There are a number of players and officials who feel they are getting the raw end of their formal 'strategic alliance' with the PGA Tour. The notion of Europe potentially pivoting to join forces with PIF and thereby providing a pathway back to the establishment fold for LIV recruits such as Rahm and co is not regarded as being as fanciful as it once was. Having said that, the DP World Tour has just announced FedEx as new sponsors for this year's French Open, a deal that is regarded as a direct benefit resulting from their formalised arrangement with the PGA Tour. Meanwhile in the United States, the gravy train with its thick and gloopy fare of excess rides on. LIV heads to Las Vegas for Super Bowl week while the PGA Tour sets up camp a tad further south in Arizona for the raucous WM Phoenix Open. WM stands for waste management - which is just what is needed when overly wealthy rival tours, with substandard products and seemingly no coherent future progression, are left squabbling for our attention. Its might be time to switch over to the Weather Channel. "

        "publication_date": "2024-04-14T00:43:03.000Z",
        "description": "-7",
        "text": " American world number one Scottie Scheffler hung on to the Masters lead on an eventful third day where Tiger Woods shot his worst score at a major. Scheffler, who is the hottest favourite at Augusta since Woods in his 2000s pomp, shot a one-under 71 to move seven under and one clear of Collin Morikawa. Morikawa carded a 69 for six under, with Max Homa (73) next on five under. Bryson DeChambeau, who jointly led overnight, hit a 75 and is three under, while Woods is 11 over after an 82. DeChambeau - a home hope like Scheffler, Morikawa and Homa - reignited his bid by holing out from the 18th fairway for a birdie on what had been a chastening day at Augusta National. The 30-year-old moved back up to fifth on the leaderboard, a shot behind Swedish debutant Ludvig Aberg, who carded 70 after two bogeys in the final four holes. Aberg, 24, only turned professional 10 months ago and, like his European Ryder Cup team-mate Nicolai Hojgaard, is aiming to become the first man to win the Masters on his debut in a major. Denmark's Hojgaard briefly led on Saturday but saw his card wrecked by five successive bogeys on the back half, ending with a 74 which left him two under. England's Tommy Fleetwood, on one under after a 72, heads what has been a somewhat underwhelming challenge so far by home golfers. How the Masters leaderboard looks going into the final day It doesn't scare me - Morikawa on chasing Scheffler The Masters third round as it happened The moment of magic produced by DeChambeau, playing in the final pair alongside fellow overnight leader Homa, was the last twist on a slow burner of a day at Augusta. For a long period, as the leading players were approaching the turn, there was little sign of the drama about to unfold. With DeChambeau making an early bogey, Scheffler escaped punishment for early errors to move into the outright lead ahead of Homa - who had 17 pars around a solitary bogey on the 12th. Chipping in for birdie on the first was the perfect start for the 2022 champion and he added another birdie with a monster putt on the third after being allowed a free drop following a wild drive.  At that point it seemed Scheffler, who won two of his three previous tournaments, would move clear of the field. However, more mistakes - a double bogey on 10 after missing a two-foot putt, followed by a bogey on 11 - was a curveball which allowed his playing partner Hojgaard to take over at the top. Hojgaard had never even played in a major, let alone led one, until three straight birdies around the turn completely changed the picture. But it proved to be a brief lead. As Hojgaard faltered, Scheffler rallied with an eagle on 13 and another birdie on 15. A bogey on 17 dropped Scheffler alongside Morikawa, before a birdie on the last re-established the 27-year-old's lead as he ultimately continued his majestic form. Morikawa, the 2021 Open champion, had made a fast start with three birdies on the opening three holes and finished with 10 straight pars while the chaos was unfolding around him. The US Ryder Cup team-mates will be out in Sunday's final pairing, teeing off at 19:35 BST. Having made the cut for a record 24th consecutive year, Woods was one over at the halfway stage and, as we have seen so many times over the years, talked bullishly about his chances at the weekend. The five-time Masters champion, aiming to match Jack Nicklaus' long-standing record of victories, said after round two that he was \"right there\". However, that proved overly optimistic as he tumbled down the leaderboard. The 48-year-old American struggled to find fairways - hitting only five of 14 - and that led to only the third time he had scored 80 or over at a major. Successive double bogeys on seven and eight did the most damage, with Woods adding six more bogeys on the back half. Woods had barely played coming into the Masters as he continues to recover from injuries sustained in a car crash in February 2021. The 15-time major champion has limited his schedule following the life-threatening crash which led to a number of operations, including on his legs and ankle. Given his lack of competitive action, even making the weekend on one of the most punishing courses in the sport was a credible achievement. The long-time former world number one looked increasing short of energy on Saturday. Asked what he has learned about his game, Woods laughed and said: \"It's rusty. I just haven't played golf, especially competitively.\" Every time Rory McIlroy returns to the Masters, there is an extra weight of history which has appeared to become a burden at times over the past 10 years. McIlroy won four majors between 2011 and 2014 - twice at the US PGA Championship, plus The Open and US Open. It leaves the Masters as the one he needs to become only the sixth man to complete a career grand slam. This week, the 34-year-old Northern Irishman's game this week has not been at the levels needed to finally win at Augusta. He carded a one-under 71 on Saturday, leaving him three over and, yet again, too far back to mount a serious challenge on Sunday. But the world number two says his mindset will be to go out and \"give it a go\".  \"If the conditions stay the same and you pick up four, five six shots you will get up the leaderboard. I will try to finish the week on a positive note,\" said McIlroy, who has earned six top-10 finishes in his pursuit of a place in golfing history. Defending champion Jon Rahm scraped into the weekend after only beating the cut by a shot, but was also unable to shoot the low score he needed to chase down the leaders. An uneventful round saw the 29-year-old Spaniard bogey the seventh before a birdie on the 17th ensured he signed for a level-par 72, leaving him five over for the tournament. He said that not challenging for the title on Sunday was a \"sour feeling\". \"Worse case I'll be a part of the ceremony,\" added the LIV Golf player, who will put the Green Jacket on the eventual champion as tradition dictates. There will be live commentary on BBC Radio 5 Live, BBC Sounds and the BBC Sport website and app from 20:00, with live text coverage on the BBC Sport website and app starting at 18:30."

        "text": " Rory McIlroy says he will play on the PGA Tour \"for the rest of my career\" as he quashed rumours of him making a big-money move to LIV Golf.  A report by City AM on Sunday said the four-time major winner had been offered $850m (\u00c2\u00a3683m) to join the Saudi Arabian-backed circuit.  But McIlroy dismissed the report in an interview with Golf Channel, external on Tuesday.  \"I honestly don't know how these things get started,\" said the Northern Irishman, 34. \"I've never been offered a number from LIV and have never contemplated going to LIV.\" McIlroy has been one of LIV Golf's most vocal critics since the breakaway tour was launched in 2022.  However, he admitted to feeling like a \"sacrificial lamb\" after a framework agreement between the PGA Tour and the Public Investment Fund, which funds LIV, was announced in June last year. But while LIV managed to add McIlroy's Ryder Cup team-mates Jon Rahm and Tyrrell Hatton to its ranks for the 2024 season, the world number two has reiterated that his future remains on the PGA Tour.  \"I think I've made it clear over the past two years that I don't think it's something for me,\" McIlroy added of LIV.  \"It doesn't mean I judge people that have went and played over there. I think one of the things I've realised over the past two years is people can make their own decisions for whatever they think is best for themselves. Who are we to judge them for that?  \"For me, my future is here on the PGA Tour and it's never been any different.\" He added: \"It's never even been a conversation for us. It's one of those things, it's unfortunate that we have to deal with it but I'm obviously here today and I'm playing this PGA Tour event next week and will play the PGA Tour for the rest of my career.\" McIlroy is coming off a disappointing week at the Masters, where he finished in a tie for 22nd in his latest unsuccessful bid to complete the career grand slam.  The 24-time PGA Tour winner is playing in this week's RBC Heritage in South Carolina before teaming up with Ireland's Shane Lowry for next week's Zurich Classic of New Orleans.

        "text": " Assessing Scottie Scheffler's imperious Masters success, it was worth recalling the season of 2009 when Tiger Woods seemed destined to sweep all before him at the majors, only to emerge empty handed from all four of the biggest tournaments. Back then Woods was an undisputed world number one. Before the Masters he won at Bay Hill, before the US Open he triumphed at Memorial, he added the AT&T National title in the build up to The Open and won at Firestone before the US PGA Championship. Each time he arrived at that year's majors he came in as red-hot favourite but faltered - he even missed the cut at the Turnberry Open. In the build up that week, I remember being asked on air whether we should bet on the field or Tiger? I chose Woods and soon after earned admonishment from former Ryder Cup captain Bernard Gallacher - then the most seasoned voice on our BBC 5Live commentary team - for my naivety. \"Always take the field in golf, if you're given the choice,\" he advised.   This sport, like few others, is so incredibly unpredictable. The influence of the weather, the time of day, the variables of topography and talent conspire to confound all too regularly. We should view Scheffler's latest achievement in this context. To win any tournament you have to beat a large number of opponents. In this case it was 88 rivals to land the title at the 88th Masters.  At the remaining majors the will be trying to beat 155 others each time. To win a tennis grand slam - and this does not diminish such a feat - a champion must win seven matches. More often than not the better player prevails, which is why it is easier to predict who will be there at the sharp end of a grand slam. Red-hot favourite Scheffler dominates to win Masters Golf dropping in priority but I still love winning - Scheffler Last week at Augusta, Scottie Scheffler confirmed himself as the best golfer on the planet, adding a second Green Jacket to his victories already this year at Bay Hill and the Players Championship. In fact, he has only been beaten by one player since March, when he finished runner-up at the Houston Open. Those March wins, coming on the toughest setup on the PGA Tour in Orlando and then against the US circuit's strongest field at Sawgrass, stoked Augusta expectation. So at the Masters, where Woods' 2005 triumph was the most recent success for the man carrying the shortest odds at the start of the week, Scheffler defied the burden of expectation to produce one of the great Augusta National performances. It was a vintage tournament, won by a golfer, on current form, who seems of a very rare vintage himself.   Scheffler, with his notably distinctive footwork, powered drive after drive with length and accuracy and proved ruthless in slamming the door shut on the final day. But only after wee wobbles had left it ajar to those vying for glory. Oddly, his trademark greens in regulation stats were outside the top 20 despite leading by one going into the final round. I remember late in the day on the windswept Friday standing behind the 14th green as he conjured the deftest of chips to get up and down from another missed green. \"Man, you are so damned good at golf,\" yelled a patron as Scheffler's ball improbably nestled next to the cup. So damned right.  Scheffler did this sort of thing time and again to set the platform for his win. And then, when the time came, he rammed his foot on the gas to power out of sight. Scheffler's Sunday approach to the treacherous ninth green for birdie was inch perfect, so too the delightful wedge to the 14th that effectively sealed the title. In between he birdied 10 and negotiated Amen Corner without disaster, just as you are supposed to do. \"It's not just the fact that he won it, it is the way that he won it,\" 5 Live summariser Trish Johnson told me. \"He gave everybody a chance and each of them tried but every time he was tested he came up trumps.   \"There's something very special about Scottie Scheffler and I'm not sure I realised how special before this week.\" Johnson, the reigning US Seniors Open champion and veteran of eight Solheim Cups, is a hugely respected observer of the game. She points to Scheffler's faith and sense of perspective as factors that set him apart.   \"He is so cool and the fact is, he doesn't think golf is the most important thing in his life,\" Johnson observed. \"Technically he is unusual. And if you watch his swing without slowing it down you wonder how he has hit so many shots with that swing.   \"But when you slow it down and see that impact position his right foot position is kind of irrelevant to what happens in the rest of the swing. Technically he is therefore very sound even though it looks a bit bizarre in full motion. \"But I think his major plus is his mind. As he says, golf is not the most important thing. Of course it is massively important but he plays as if it is not.   \"The last day of the Masters was something quite special because he was in a bit of trouble and then he went into another gear. You get some players that the others just see and think oh no I can't beat him, like Tiger in his prime.\" Johnson believes Scheffler has now built such a formidable reputation, his name appearing on future leaderboards will strike fear among rivals.   \"They know he doesn't back off ,\" said the 58-year-old Englishwoman. \"And then you get that aura about someone and you see their name at the top of the leaderboard and you think, ah, here we go again.\" Scheffler deserves all the plaudits flying his direction. Traditionally this has been his time of year and it will be interesting to see whether he continues this dominance at the year's remaining three majors, especially with impending fatherhood. Regardless, this was a Masters to relish and remember. And not just for the champion.   We do not always recall who came second, but rather like Seve Ballesteros' runner up finish at the 1976 Open to Johnny Miller, we will not forget Ludvig Aberg's challenge last Sunday. Who knows what might have been had he not gone into the water at the 11th? Maybe the 24-year-old might have made life a lot more uncomfortable for the champion down the stretch. Regardless, he is by a distance, Europe's most exciting young talent. \"I  think he is very special,\" Johnson commented. \"There is something about him.   \"He is charismatic, plays quickly; he's unusual, he's smiley and he's the type of player you want to root for.   \"When I watch golf I want someone to entertain me and he's got absolutely everything. If he carries on  this trajectory, he's going to be a superstar.\" In Scheffler, the game already has one. Even in a sport as unpredictable as the game of golf, he is undoubtedly the man to beat at the moment."

        "text": " Sign up for notifications to the latest Insight features via the BBC Sport app and read the latest in the series here. The sun was low in the sky and the shadows lengthening from the towering Augusta pine trees as Canadian Mike Weir approached his ball on the 10th fairway. Len Mattiace, his opponent in a sudden-death play-off, was in a spot of bother off the green. To all but secure the coveted Masters green jacket, Weir just had to hit the green with his approach shot. A life-changing victory rested on a couple of degrees of direction and a few pounds of pressure on the club face. The slightest waver in concentration, though, and it could be all over. The chance to land a first major may never come around again. The tension was huge. But some of the talk that had got him there was decidedly small. Caddie Brennan Little had lightened the mood around the Augusta National by chatting to Weir about the stars of WWE wrestling. Being a caddie is a lot more than carrying clubs - you are a confidant, coach, walking database, psychiatrist, the furthest inside the ropes and in the midst of the action. It is a sporting role like no other. Little grew up in southern Canada near Toronto with the dream of becoming a major champion himself. As a young prospect, he played with and against Weir before realising that he may need to go down a different route to his best friend to taste success at the highest level. \"I played some professional golf, but my career ended in 1998. I just wasn't playing very well and I wasn't getting any better,\" Little tells BBC Sport. \"Mike had gotten his tour card and I started as his caddie in 1999 thinking I would do it for a little bit. I have been caddying ever since. \"It is just kind of one of them things that happened. I just fell into it.\" Like with all best friends, shared laughter is the sound of memories being made. For Little and Weir, it is no different. Both shared a love for family and sport, with Little often poking fun at Weir for his lack of knowledge on WWE. \"If you get on well and have things in common, whether it is sports or whatever, that is the key,\" Little says. \"If you don't have anything in common then you are going to be out there walking around trying to create conversation. \"Mike and I used to talk a lot about wrestling on the course. He was always a closet wrestling fan.\" Weir went into his final round at Augusta two shots off the lead, but a superb 68 took him into a duel with American Mattiace for golf's biggest prize and a $1m winner's cheque. It was two mates having fun around the course that got Weir and Little into such uncharted territory. It was the same formula that saw them home to Butler Cabin. From that 10th fairway, Weir struck his approach shot and it landed on the back of the green - leaving a putt to win the Masters. \"They have been best friends since they were teens, playing junior golf and the Canadian tour together. He has worked with Mike since he came through the qualifying school. It is quite a partnership,\" said the television commentator as Weir lined up his putt. It certainly felt like a team effort to Little. \"It is a huge moment of personal satisfaction for everyone,\" Little says of a successful weekend on the bag. Little, who earned a weekly salary from the then 32-year-old Weir, also gained a share of all his winnings. It is a common arrangement, with percentages varying between pairings. A caddie might get a basic of $2,000 (\u00c2\u00a31,580) a week, with 7% of their player's winnings, jumping up to 10% for a finish near the top of the leaderboard. If a season goes well, a caddie might pick up a bonus. However, most caddies cover their own expenses, which, on a globe-trotting tour, can quickly rack up. When times are good and the million-dollar cheques get split, both parties are happy. But when times get tough and the money thins out, a golfer may feel that a hole in his pocket is the only thing their caddie is providing. All in all, even best friends can get fired. \"It is all part of the business,\" Little says. \"You are probably going to get fired and you are also going to leave a player and get a better job. \"Sometimes change is good; guys can just get flat. They might fire their caddie and say, 'We are still good buddies but I have to make a change to mix something up'.\" Weir and Little worked together for 11 years until 2010 before Little took up a new challenge with Colombian Camilo Villegas. There were no hard feelings between Weir and Little, rather a mutual agreement to try something new. Little now works with American Gary Woodland, with the pair winning the 2019 US Open together. In golf, the caddie and player can both benefit from working with others. In 2023, Little spent time with England's Justin Rose in the run-up to the Open. \"It was interesting to see how he operates,\" says Little. \"It is totally different. It is good to see his routines - when you are with one guy you only see the same thing. \"I would even encourage it - if Gary had a buddy to play with him, I would be totally fine with it. \"It helps clear his head space. If you have a guy who relies on you too much as a caddie, he is not thinking for himself.\" The one constant on the tour as a caddie is the community. Bits of local know-how about the course and its set-up are often shared. At last year's Masters, Brooks Koepka's caddie from Northern Ireland, Ricky Elliott, was cleared of revealing to Little, in contravention to golf's rules,, external what club Koepka had used for a shot. While caddies are not allowed to swap tips mid-round, they often walk the course together before competitions to discuss strategy. \"Sometimes it is good to just talk to guys and see what they think about a hole and whether or not I agree - it doesn't matter,\" says Little. \"It is good to get some different opinions.\" Taneka Mackey is part of that caddie community. She carries Amy Olson's bag on the Ladies Professional Golf Association Tour (LPGA). Like Little, she fell into the role. Growing up in the Bahamas and making their national golf team, Mackey always had a passion for travelling. After a chance pairing to help Olson at an event in the Bahamas in 2017, she saw the possibility of a career that would take her round the world. \"Amy said, 'I still want you to caddie for me - can you come to Australia?' When I heard the word 'Australia' I knew I needed to get in shape and learn a few more things,\" Mackey says. Mackey has found herself at events and venues across the world where she is the only black woman on the bag. On one trip to Asia there were no black female players and only one black caddie. Mackey felt uncomfortable for \"half a second\" with thoughts of \"do I belong here?\" entering her head. \"I am here for a reason and I am going to be the person that makes the difference,\" she says. \"From then I have never looked back. I take everything in my stride, staying as positive as possible. There is so much negativity in this world that the last person I am going to beat down is myself. \"With female caddies, there aren't many - it is hard physically, some women might want kids, and you can't carry a bag and caddie forever.\" In golf, consistency, longevity and commitment are core components of success. Mackey's turn of speed has also proved useful. A keen basketball player in her youth and the daughter of a talented hurdler, Mackey had to sprint back down the second fairway at one event after realising she had dropped her towel on the opening green. With each club requiring a dry-down after every shot, there was not a moment's hesitation. Olson tied for second at the 2020 US Open and Mackey is still hunting a first major title on the bag. The 29-year-old also has a different achievement in her sights. Her goal is to set up an elementary school in the Bahamas and inspire the next generation of young black girls. \"Golf-wise, I want to win, but if I never win as a caddie I am perfectly fine with that. It is just more showing kids and inspiring people, especially in the Bahamas, that you can do what you put your mind to,\" she says. \"I speak at schools here in the Bahamas in my off weeks just to show kids that you can grow up in a small country but do big things.\" From the feeling of winning a major to inspiring a new generation - the ambitions of a caddie are as varied as the duties. It is much more than just carrying a set of clubs.

        "text": " English pair Jodie Ewart Shadoff and Georgia Hall enjoyed strong starts at the Chevron Championship as American Lauren Coughlin leads. Coughlin, 31, holds a first-round lead for just the second time in her career. Ewart Shadoff and Hall both signed for an opening round of 70, ending the day on two under, and four shots adrift of the lead at the first women's golf major of the season. World number one Nelly Korda is in a three-way tie for second on four under. The American is attempting to become the first woman since Annika Sorenstam (2004-05) to win in five consecutive starts, and just the third in the history of the LPGA Tour, also matching Nancy Lopez (1978). Korda was immediately on the back foot when picking up a bogey on the par-four second but she quickly settled down with four birdies prior to the turn.  Another bogey on the 10th slowed her progress before birdies on the 14th and 17th helped Korda claim a share of second place alongside compatriot Marina Alex and Japan's Minami Katsu. \"I didn't think it was going to drain me as much as it did maybe mentally,\" said Korda, referring to her run of playing in three consecutive events last month. \"I can still feel a little bit of tiredness, so it took me a while to get going. I felt the nerves at the start of the round.\" Leader Coughlin navigated the The Club at Carlton Woods course superbly, picking up three birdies on the front nine and repeating that feat on the back nine. Northern Ireland's Stephanie Meadow shot a 71 and is alongside English amateur Lottie Woad, who is fresh from winning the prestigious Augusta National Women's Amateur earlier this month. Last year's champion Lilia Vu withdrew just before her tee time as the American continues to struggle with a back injury."

        "text": " The United States is all agog with women's sport although the fascination has yet to extend to female golf stars despite the extraordinary feats of Nelly Korda. This might change somewhat if the 25-year-old world number one collects her fifth straight win and second major title this week. Were she to succeed in the Chevron Championship here in Texas she would emulate the great Nancy Lopez in 1978. Korda is the first American to win four consecutive tournaments on the LPGA since Lopez won five straight 46 years ago. This astonishing streak made the then rookie front page material for Sports Illustrated.  Lopez's run began at the Greater Baltimore Classic and included a major title at the LPGA Championship. Right now the headlines are being dominated by basketball's Caitlin Clark, the number one pick in the recent WNBA's draft following her stellar college career with the Iowa Hawkeyes. Her performances have garnered massive TV audiences - 18.9m - which was twice the number of people who watched Scottie Scheffler win the Masters last Sunday. At 9.6m, they represented a worrying drop of 20% on the previous year. Korda's feats have yet to transcend the golfing village, and perhaps that suits her as she \"tries to stay in my bubble\".  But the American Solheim Cup player does recognise that more could be done to tell the increasingly compelling story of women's golf. \"I feel like we just need a stage,\" she told reporters here at Carlton Woods just north of Houston.  \"We need to be put on TV.  \"I feel like when it's tape delay, or anything like that, that hurts our game. Women's sports just needs a stage. If we have a stage we can show up and perform and show people what we're all about.\" Korda has beaten every golfer she has faced on the LPGA Tour since the Drive On Championship at Bradenton Country Club in late January.   There has been a seven-week break in that spell, but she returned to win at Palos Verdes in California, the Ford Championship in Arizona and then the Match Play in Las Vegas. Last week was an off week. She says she has never felt more tired and while she hit Florida's beaches, Scheffler - a similarly dominant figure in the men's game - was surging to his Masters triumph. The expectation levels that accompanied the Augusta victor are similar to those surrounding Korda this week. \"Gosh, I don't think anyone can ever say anything bad about Scottie,\" Korda told me. \"I love his morals, I love his attitude out there. I just love the way he goes about his business. He inspires so many around him, including myself. \"As he said, he wants to win every tournament he tees it up in. That's every girl that's out here competing, too.  \"I think that you just have to go about your business. You can get lost in the articles, lost in the expectations, but I think if you just stick to your true self, I feel like you can live in your own bubble and enjoy it a lot more.\" Korda realises this is a special time. But the Women's PGA champion of three years ago is still waiting for that second major title. It is surely just around the corner.  \"In 2021 I went on a run, and then in 2022 and 2023 golf really humbled me,\" she said. \"There are ups and downs. Every athlete goes through the rollercoaster, and that is what makes the sport so great. You mature and grow so much and learn more about yourself. \"You never take these weeks for granted. You always try to appreciate and become very grateful for them.  \"It makes just all the hard work so worth it. But I think I've learned so much about myself even through the losses.\" Korda is likely to consult her yardage book for more than distance advice this week because she has written important motivational messages that have yielded a quartet of wins in this extraordinary run.  \"They're private,\" she teased. \"They were ones that (coach) Jamie Mulligan had me put in there.  \"Actually the first week I had it was in Bradenton, the yardage book. I look at those sayings --there are four in there, and I look at those sayings almost every hole.\" She will need to beat a first class field here including Lilia Vu, for whom this title was one of two major successes last year. Korda, who is above Vu at the top of the world rankings, was runner up 12 months ago so knows she can play well around this course. Britain's best hope is Charley Hull, who was second to Vu at last year's AIG Women's Open, but the Englishwoman, ranked seventh in the world, may be hampered by a freak right ankle injury sustained while throwing a ball for her dog. Farnham's Lottie Woad is also in the field, fresh from winning the prestigious Augusta National Women's Amateur title on the eve of Masters week. But the coming days will be all about how Korda fares. Success would be a significant boost in the bid to popularise the women's game.  Her aims appear to be grounded in solid foundations. She said she intends to \"enjoy every second of it\", adding: \"Careers go by really fast and there are so many highs and lows in.  \"Just be grateful about it all and very humble.\""

        "text": " Masters champion Jon Rahm has called for the LIV Golf League to move to 72 holes and believes his lucrative switch to the breakaway tour could prove a \"tipping point\" in the ongoing battle for the future of men's professional golf. The 29-year-old Spaniard is looking forward to his Augusta title defence this week having finished joint fourth at last week's LIV event in Miami, although he led his Legion XIII quartet to victory in the team event. For the first time this year, all of the world's best players will be at the same venue when the Masters tees off on Thursday. The opening major of the 2024 calendar begins with the men's game still split as the PGA Tour explores a possible relationship with LIV's Saudi Arabian backers.  Before his move, Rahm was critical of LIV's abbreviated 54-hole duration and despite signing a contract reportedly worth \u00c2\u00a3450m he believes his new employers should consider moving to the traditional 72-hole format. The LIV calendar currently has 14 54-hole tournaments with a shotgun start and no cut, and players compete for both individual and team honours at each event.  Speaking to BBC Sport, Rahm said: \"If there ever was a way where LIV could go to 72 holes I think it would help all of this argument a lot.   \"The closer I think we can get LIV Golf to some other things the better. I think it would be for some kind of unification to feed into a world tour or something like that.   \"I don't know if I'm alone in this, but I definitely wouldn't mind going back to 72 holes.\" 5 Live Sport podcast: All About...The Jon Rahm one How to follow Masters on BBC McIlroy consults Woods' former coach before Masters Watch: Inside the Saudi sporting machine Rahm remains an influential global star having added the Masters to his 2021 US Open title which was won at Torrey Pines in California. He had been a staunch LIV critic but shook the golfing establishment with his move at the end of last year. He agrees with the notion that if LIV could lure him to their ranks, they are capable of securing the services of pretty much any leading player and have now proven themselves to be a significant part of the modern golf scene.   \"That's a well thought out argument,\" he told me. \"I could be the start of a tipping point in that sense.   \"I understood the weight that [my] decision could have and the impact it could have. I understood that perfectly and that's why it wasn't an easy decision.   \"The balance of golf could be disturbed a little bit. Luckily in my career, especially last year, I accomplished a lot and I got to be one of the bigger names in golf.   \"There are few active players that could have had a bigger impact than myself in that sense. Not to be patting myself on the back too much, but I understood the position I was in.\" Rahm points to the 6 June 2023 announcement of a \"framework agreement\" between the Saudi Public Investment Fund (PIF) and the PGA and DP World Tours as a pivotal moment for him. He, like all the leading players on both tours, was blindsided by the move and at the time spoke of a sense of \"betrayal\" by the tour's hierarchy. \"I was not happy,\" he admitted.  \"At the US Open trying to deal with something like that wasn't perfect timing. What we need to reflect on is the second that framework agreement was worked on, everything changed.   \"And that's where the beginning of all this change happened. If it wasn't me (making the move) it would have been someone else at some point. \"If the PGA Tour is now open to working with the PIF or LIV or maybe coming together in some kind of way then that opened the door for me to do the same thing.\" Behind the scenes this week the politicking will continue in the confines of the Augusta National clubhouse. Rumours are already circulating that PIF governor Yasir Al-Rumayyan could be in attendance at the Masters.   But Rahm will put golf's future to one side to concentrate on defending his crown. Remembering 12 months ago he smiles at the way that he initially embarked on securing his first Green Jacket. He began with a double bogey after four-putting the opening green. \"I'm very happy to talk about it now,\" he laughed.   \"It was very unusual. I hit a perfect tee shot, eight-iron to the centre of the green - so far according to plan - and then hit that first putt a little too hard and then misread the next two.   \"I think the part that gets lost here is, obviously I'm not happy about doubling the first hole. But if you are going to make a mistake like that it might as well be early enough that you have plenty of time to rectify. \"Every single one of those putts felt good.\" He bounced back with a birdie at the second and was able to satisfy what he regards as a key benchmark for the opening stretch through the cathedral pines of the famed Alister Mackenzie layout. \"I believe if you are on the seventh fairway at even par you are doing good. At Augusta National the first six holes can be really challenging.   \"There are a lot of mistakes that can happen, a lot of bogeys that can happen so that was my challenge and actually I was on the seventh fairway at even par, made birdie on seven and I felt like there was no difference whatsoever.\" Last year's tournament was blighted by the weather and Rahm was required to play 30 holes on the final day before emerging triumphant and joining fellow Spaniards Seve Ballesteros, Jose Maria Olazabal and Sergio Garcia in winning the Masters. \"We played a lot of golf on the weekend,\" Rahm recalled. \"The last one somewhat like that I believe was 2005. Tiger [Woods] was telling me he played 54 holes on the weekend because of weather delays.\" He believes his form has been better in the month leading up to the tournament than it was a year ago when he posted three early PGA Tour wins. He dismisses the notion that LIV lacks the intensity of competition provided by his former circuit. \"I see everybody's scepticism,\" Rahm said. \"I get it. I've been there, I voiced it to more people than most people would probably speak to.  \"It was one of the things that was holding me back from possibly joining LIV Golf. But now, having been here, once you start the tournament I really sometimes have forgotten that I've only played 54 holes.\" And he is convinced that he will get an added boost from now being qualified to use the ultra exclusive champions locker room.   \"Going back and knowing that you're a champion and that you have an idea of how to get things done and the confidence that you know you can get it done again is always an added bonus,\" he said. \"It'll be a little different being defending champion but I should have a little bit extra motivation too.\" He is looking forward to hosting a Basque themed champions dinner, featuring small local snacks called pintxos, on the Tuesday evening. Tradition (there are so many at the Masters) dictates he will pick up the tab, but readily and happily acknowledges he can well afford it. Indeed, he is ready to revel in all that comes with being a winner of golf's most glamorous tournament. \"It is quite incredible isn't it?\" he smiled.   \"Being able to go in that locker room and be surrounded by those players. It's a very exclusive club; very, very exclusive and very special.   \"I'm hoping that I'm someone who can come back as defending champion and give it a good run and hopefully win it.\" He would be the first to successfully defend since Woods 22 years ago. Given the seismic impact of his transition to the LIV tour, the implications of such a success would be significant. You can listen to the entire interview with Jon Rahm in BBC Radio 5 Live's 'Masters preview' programme from 21:00 BST on Monday, 8 April on BBC Sounds."

        "description": "-11",
        "text": " World number one Scottie Scheffler won the Masters for a second time after a commanding performance at Augusta National demonstrated why he was the red-hot pre-tournament favourite. Scheffler, who led overnight by a shot, hit a four-under 68 in Sunday's final round to finish four clear on 11 under. Sweden's Ludvig Aberg shot 69 to finish runner-up on his major debut. England's Tommy Fleetwood (69) ended joint third with American pair Collin Morikawa (74) and Max Homa (73). Fleetwood put together an impressive round to make a late charge up the leaderboard and record his best finish at the Masters. But catching Scheffler was out of reach. The 27-year-old American showed rare emotion on the 18th green as he received the acclaim of the Augusta patrons after wrapping up his second Masters victory in three years. There had been a possibility the 2022 champion might not even complete the final round. Scheffler's wife Meredith is due to give birth to their first child and the Texan said on Saturday he was prepared to leave Augusta mid-round if she went into labour on Sunday. Addressing his wife during the Green Jacket presentation ceremony, Scheffler said: \"I love you and I'm coming home. I'll be home as quick as I can.\" He added: \"I can't put into words what it is like to win here again and what it will be like to become a father for the first time.\"   Golf to drop in priority for Scheffler Reaction to Scheffler's win at Augusta National How the final Masters leaderboard looks Not since Tiger Woods dominated golf in the 2000s had anybody arrived at Augusta as strong a favourite as Scheffler. He came into the first major of the year on the back of two victories in his three previous tournaments - at the Arnold Palmer Invitational and the Players Championship - and a second-place finish at the Houston Open. That imperious form, combined with his pedigree as a previous Masters champion, meant his odds were as short as 4-1 at the start of the week. While not hitting the expected heights on the opening three days, particularly during an eventful round on Saturday where he recovered from several mistakes, he still led by a shot going into Sunday. However, he lacked distance control with his irons in the opening holes and a bogey on the seventh dropped him back alongside Morikawa and Aberg. Homa joined them in a four-way tie for the lead after a birdie on the eighth. But Scheffler - playing alongside Morikawa in the group behind Aberg and Homa - birdied the same hole to lead again on seven under.  Then came a moment of magic which felt like a potential turning point - and proved to be so. Scheffler almost holed a magnificent 89-yard approach on the ninth, demonstrating sublime skill to spin the ball and use Augusta's contours to roll it towards the pin - leaving himself with a tap-in for back-to-back birdies. Scheffler added a third successive birdie on the 10th but as the leaders approached Amen Corner - the famed section of the course featuring the 11th, 12th and 13th holes - it was still too close to call.  However, by the time he teed off on the short 12th, it was his tournament to lose. His nearest rivals - Aberg, Morikawa and Homa - all picked up costly double bogeys in the space of about 15 minutes, handing a three-shot lead to Scheffler even though he had bogeyed the 11th. Aberg and Morikawa both pulled their approaches on the 11th into the water, while a bad bounce for Homa on the iconic par-three 12th left him in the bushes and taking a one-shot penalty. From that point, Scheffler could relax more and birdies on 13, 14 and 16 all but clinched victory. Aberg's hopes of becoming the third man to win on his first start in a major were over, but he finished second after recovering with birdies on 13 and 14. The composed 24-year-old, who only turned professional 10 months ago, was described as a \"generational talent\" by European Ryder Cup captain Luke Donald before helping Europe beat the US in Rome last September. He is admired for his clean ball-striking and showed this weekend why he is expected to challenge regularly for the majors. The progress of the players from Great Britain and Northern Ireland had been rather underwhelming, but 33-year-old Fleetwood remained patient and was rewarded with a top-10 finish. In reality, Fleetwood needed a better round to put himself into serious contention but played solidly to leave him feeling optimistic going into next month's US PGA Championship at Valhalla. \"I guess I needed a few more fireworks. But the golf course wasn't giving much away,\" said Fleetwood, who made his eighth appearance at the Masters. \"Who knows if my time will ever come, but all I can do is keep trying to put myself there and having performances like this.\" Northern Ireland's Rory McIlroy was unable to finish with a flurry as his 10-year wait for the major title which evades him continued.  The 34-year-old won four majors between 2011 and 2014 - twice at the PGA Championship, plus the Open Championship and US Open - but was never in contention as he looked to become only the sixth man to complete the career grand slam. McIlroy struggled in the testing conditions as he opened with rounds of 71, 77 and 71, carding a final 73 to finish well adrift at four over. \"It hasn't been my year but I'll keep coming back until it is my year,\" he said. England's Tyrrell Hatton was level par after a final-day 69, while Matt Fitzpatrick ended four over and 2016 champion Danny Willett, playing in his first tournament since having shoulder surgery in September, faded from a good start to finish nine over. Five-time Masters champion Tiger Woods finished last of the 60 players who made the cut to play all four rounds, shooting a five-over 77 to finish 16 over in total. Even making the weekend was an achievement for the 15-time champion, who had barely played in the past year as he continues to recover from injuries sustained in a car crash in February 2021. However, packed galleries followed Woods around the scene of some of his most famous triumphs, with patrons roaring him off the final green and hoping they will get many more chances to see the 48-year-old at Augusta in the future. Defending champion Jon Rahm was already out of contention and things got even worse as he recorded his highest total in eight appearances at the Masters. The 29-year-old Spaniard, who has made a shock switch to the breakaway LIV Golf tour since his victory last year, shot a 76 and finished nine over."

        "text": " Bob MacIntyre perhaps painted the most fitting picture of Keith Pelley's tenure as DP World Tour boss when he played at last week's Valspar Championship in Tampa. The fact that the Scot was competing on those Floridian fairways was down to Pelley's most controversial contribution in his nine years in charge of the Wentworth-based organisation. And MacIntryre's decision to use caddie Mike Burrows' bib to taunt US fans with the Ryder Cup result from last year's match was also telling. It reminded us of arguably Pelley's biggest triumph, the staging of that epic event in Rome last September. This is the 60-year-old's final week in charge of the European tour before he heads back to his native Canada where he becomes boss of the four leading sports franchises in his home city of Toronto. When he arrived in 2015 he was already aware of upstart plans for a golf super league. Pelley also knew that his new employers were struggling to rival the behemoth of the US-based PGA Tour. His initial ambition was to make the European Tour a viable alternative for the continent's leading stars - to stem what had long since become an inevitable migration across the pond. He was brash and combative. A diminutive figure, who wore flashy, colourful glasses with a vision to elevate the little guys from Europe into an outfit to rival the big boys Stateside. It was a laudable ambition and a Rolex Series of elevated tournaments with inflated prize funds and enhanced television coverage soon followed. But these tournaments did nothing to stem the flow of talent crossing the Atlantic. Pelley wanted to modernise golf but was hamstrung because his ultimate responsibility was to the tour's membership.   This meant a diverse list of priorities and inbuilt antipathy towards change unless there were guaranteed benefits to the individual members he needed to convince. It was a tough environment because there were a lot of egos to satisfy among a wide range of members at differing stages of careers. Keeping everyone happy was nigh on impossible.  But Pelley did score success in improving the pace of play on his tour. There was music on certain ranges and a more modern feel at tournaments recognising the business opportunities of enhancing fan experiences. Pelley knew the PGA Tour could not be beaten and his ultimate vision was for a world tour and collaboration with the United States. But there were also offers to consider from the upstart breakaway Premier Golf League. The PGL claimed massive financial backing and a new and extraordinarily lucrative vision for the game.  Combining with them could have been the pathway towards an organisation that could have genuinely rivalled Jay Monahan's US tour. But Monahan was also keen to foster a closer relationship with Europe. Pelley instructed two senior executives to provide detailed analysis on both camps before eventually opting to go with the US Tour. The 2020 strategic alliance with the PGA Tour was the safer option because, for all their talk PGL had no players signed up. And Monahan already had control of Europe's biggest stars such as Rory McIlroy and Jon Rahm.   The deal was also necessary to bolster the DP World Tour's finances which were dramatically and damagingly drained by the impact of covid. This decision was also a savage blow to the PGL because Monahan stubbornly had no interest in dealing with any newcomers to the pro golf market. And the arrangement with the PGA Tour meant Pelley's hands were also tied in terms of joining forces with other organisations. Then Saudi Arabia entered the market with a vengeance. The Kingdom's sportwashing tactics meant it took PGL's model, rocking the men's game like never before with the arrival in 2022 of the LIV tour. Pelley was obliged to act in lockstep with Monahan. Many say the Canadian should have \"done the deal\" with Saudi Arabia and that was certainly the view of several enduring and celebrated European names who immediately jumped ship to LIV. But, having also signed a massive contract to rebrand his circuit as the DP World Tour, Pelley could point to having secured the future for all of his remaining members and that, after all, was his number one priority. He further strengthened the relationship with the PGA Tour in June 2022, negotiating hard to provide a formalised pathway for his 10 most successful players, not already exempt, to gain prized tour cards in the United States. This highly contentious policy became reality at the start of this year and is why MacIntyre was in Florida last week.    The 27-year-old from Oban was also a member of the victorious Ryder Cup team and so took part in arguably the greatest edition of this famous match which remains the biggest event in golf. Pelley staged the match in Italy and there was initially plenty of scepticism about that bold move. But a glorious week at Marco Simone was a resounding success - golf never felt more big time. And that was always his vision for developing the game.   He had also piloted the tour through the unique challenges of covid, secured prize funds for the medium term and departs insisting its finances are secure.  As a player who served on the tour's tournament committee remarked: \"How thankful I am to Keith for his work ethic and enthusiasm. \"Challenges largely beyond his control throughout his tenure inhibited his desire to grow the tour and instead he had to act in ways that would have been unforeseen when taking up the job.\" Critics point to the fact that the best talent is now being given away on a yearly basis and that the European Tour is now intrinsically linked with the fortunes of a PGA Tour that is under massive pressure from the Saudi Arabia-funded LIV league. So assessments on Pelley's legacy are mixed. The DP World Tour player added: \"I accept his time as chief executive will be seen differently by some, but for me he was a good leader.\" Having watched his tenure closely, I believe him to also be a warm, genuine, and thoughtful man. He possesses an astute business brain and did the best with the cards he was dealt. But he departs with issues aplenty still to be resolved. The men's professional game is in turmoil and his successor - Ryder Cup director Guy Kinnings -  faces a formidable in-tray."

        "text": " Tyrrell Hatton says working out whether to move to the LIV Golf League was so difficult he wished he could have had someone else make the decision for him. The 32-year-old Englishman, who has been a mainstay of the past three European Ryder Cup teams, followed team-mate Jon Rahm to the Saudi Arabia-funded breakaway circuit last February. Hatton plays the Masters next week knowing that his performances in this year's majors will be vital to his long-term chances of continuing to play the four biggest tournaments in the men's calendar. The Buckinghamshire star agreed his reported \u00c2\u00a350m move after agonising over the decision during January's Dubai Desert Classic.   It was only at the last moment he opted to fly to Mexico for LIV's 2024 opening tournament rather than that week's PGA Tour stop at Pebble Beach. 'Rahm's seismic LIV switch leaves golf deeply fractured' Saudi sports minister says claims of 'sportswashing' against the country are \"very shallow\" \"This all came about over the weekend of Dubai,\" Hatton told BBC Sport. \"The following week was a pretty stressful one. I almost wanted a crystal ball to know what the right decision would be.   \"I spoke to so many people in that week, almost to the point of wanting to have someone to make the decision for me. It was hard. You don't know what's the right decision.   \"I knew that if I stayed and played PGA Tour, if I play how I have been for the past seven, eight years then I should stay within the top 50 and give myself the best chance of making the Ryder Cup and playing in all the majors and that's what I want to do.\" Hatton says the lure of becoming part of Masters champion Rahm's newly formed Legion XIII team was pivotal to his decision. They had forged a successful partnership in Italy at last September's Ryder Cup victory, winning both of their foursomes matches.     \"We obviously get on very well and we had a good record in Rome,\" said Hatton. \"So, there were certain things with LIV that I really liked. But, as I say, it was going into the unknown and not sure if it would be the right thing.   \"But so far I'm happy and ultimately that's the most important thing.\" And he claims that money was not the prime motive behind his move. \"Everyone knows that side of it,\" Hatton said. \"Yeah, it's nice but ultimately it's not everything. \"I like that idea of being part of a team, I like the schedule and not in the sense of playing less. That's not my goal whatsoever. I like the fact that we're going to different places around the world.\"  But he also knows there is plenty of jeopardy involved in making the move to a circuit where he has finished in shares of eighth, 12th, 15th and 21st in his four appearances to date.   \"It's taking that risk but its something I was excited by and ultimately decided that was the route I was going to go down,\" Hatton added.  With the PGA Tour re-engaged in talks with Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund, he admits his conclusion to move could have been even harder to make.  \"I think the talk of golf hopefully coming together made the decision marginally easier, but it was still a really difficult decision for me to make,\" he said.  The atmosphere is less hostile between the rival tours than it was when Lee Westwood, Ian Poulter and Sergio Garcia departed at the start of LIV's first season in 2022. \"It's definitely softened,\" Hatton said. \"Some of the lads described themselves as looking like Swiss cheese with all the holes that they'd had taken out of them for the abuse that they received.   \"Unfortunately social media isn't the nicest of places. I actually deleted my social media because I knew that there was going to be negativity. \"I just didn't want any of that judgement and negativity in front of me. So I deleted that and it's been quite nice actually.\" Hatton says the biggest drawback to playing LIV's 54-hole shotgun starts is the fact that rounds can start at any part of the course.   \"My routine I've always been walking onto the tee two or three minutes before we're due to go and you keep that rhythm from the range,\" he said. \"Sometimes you have to leave 20 minutes before the shotgun start.\" But the biggest downside is undoubtedly the loss of a regular source of world ranking points, the currency he requires to maintain major status. This year he is eligible for the full set; the Masters, US PGA, US Open and Open Championship. \"It's hard,\" he admitted. \"I have to earn 20-25 world ranking points this year to be in all four majors next year. That's the equivalent of finishing fifth on your own in a major.   \"It's doable and it would be nice if I could have a really good week next week at the Masters - although that's been challenging for me over my previous seven visits.\" A winner of the BMW PGA Championship at Wentworth and the Alfred Dunhill Links at St Andrews, Hatton still wants to play European Tour events. Moving to LIV makes that more difficult unless fines and suspensions are lifted as punishments for tour members who compete in its events. \"While I understand it makes it a little bit more difficult there's still kind of a pathway to play DP World Tour events unlike the PGA Tour where we've been suspended,\" Hatton said. He is also keen to retain his place in Europe's Ryder Cup team and has spoken to captain Luke Donald to remind him of this ambition.   But that is a long-term goal. More immediately he plays this week's LIV event here at Donald Trump's Doral resort near Miami. And then it is the Masters next week where 2018's share of 18th place is his only top 20. This year's quest for a Green Jacket, given the decision he agonised over earlier this year, would seem to carry more pressure than ever before but while it sounds like a deflection tactic, he is trying to play down such significance.  \"The majors on paper are going to have more emphasis than there has been in previous years,\" he said. \"But I'm not really looking at it like that. There's no reason why I can't go and have a great week.\""

        "text": " Thailand's Atthaya Thitikul and South Korea's Im Jin Hee hold a one-shot lead at the halfway stage of the Chevron Championship, the first women's major of the season. The pair lead American world number one Nelly Korda, who is bidding to win her fifth tournament in a row and second major title. Korda had the clubhouse lead in Texas on seven under after a round of 69. But late on, Thitikul and Im both shot 67s for eight-under totals.  Jodi Ewart Shadoff and Lottie Woad lead the English challenge on four under. Korda, who began the day two shots behind leader Lauren Coughlin, had a dreadful start with a double bogey at her opening hole. But she quickly recovered with birdies at the second and fourth, and although she dropped another shot at the seventh, four more birdies ensured she remained in contention. Korda chasing fifth LPGA Tour win in row at first women's major of 2024 The 25-year-old is attempting to become the first woman since Annika Sorenstam (2004-05) to win in five consecutive starts, and just the third in the history of the LPGA Tour, also matching Nancy Lopez (1978). \"Sometimes when you start to make mistakes you just don't really feel confident or you don't feel that great,\" she said. \"But I just told myself that it's the first hole of the tournament today. Even though I may have made a double, I wanted to save a bogey. There is still so much golf to be played and there is still a good bit of gettable par-5s, that's usually what I think about, just the opportunities that I have ahead.\" Thitkul, 21, a two-time LPGA winner, who is playing in her first tournament of the year after a thumb injury, finished strongly with a birdie at the 18th while rookie Im, who had four wins on the Korean tour last year, led the field in putting in her round. There were emotional scenes at the last hole when two-time major winner Ryu So-yeon of South Korea said her final farewell to the tour after missing the cut. \"I'm very numb now. I just cannot believe this is real. Nobody pushed me to retire. That was my decision. Still I just cannot believe this is real,\" said the 33-year-old."

        "description": "-11 ",
        "text": " Masters champion Scottie Scheffler says his fierce determination to win means he will continue to chase victories despite admitting golf is about to become less of a priority in his life. Scheffler secured a four-shot victory over Sweden's rising star Ludvig Aberg at Augusta National on Sunday. Between now and next month's major, the US PGA Championship, Scheffler and his wife are expecting their first child. \"I'm not going to intentionally take my eye off the ball,\" said the American. \"I still love competing. I love winning. I hate losing.\" Golf, however, was not his main focus after winning a second Green Jacket, the 27-year-old's thoughts instead turning to his heavily pregnant wife Meredith, who stayed at home in Texas \"All I can think about is getting home. It is a special time for us,\" said the world number one. \"I will go home, soak in this victory and enjoy the birth of my first child. I am looking forward to celebrating with Meredith - it's been a long week without her. \"My priorities will change very soon. My son or daughter will be the main priority, along with my wife, so golf will now be probably fourth in line,\" he added, before referring to role his Christian faith played in his victory. It was Scheffler's third win in his past four tournaments and his second major, to add to his 2022 Masters victory. Since winning that first Green Jacket, Scheffler has been the world's best player and throughout 2023 was peerless in almost all metrics, with only well-documented putting struggles stopping him from converting more of his 18 consecutive top-12 finishes into wins. That changed in March when he won the Arnold Palmer Invitational and then became the first player to win successive Players Championship titles - and he carried that form into the Masters. The victory sees Scheffler join Tiger Woods as the only players to win both the PGA Tour's flagship Players title and the Masters in the same season. Red-hot favourite Scheffler dominates to win Masters How the final Masters leaderboard looks His caddie, Ted Scott, who won this title in 2012 and 2014 with Bubba Watson, described Scheffler as \"a different kind of special\". \"When he called me, I had no idea he was that good,\" said Scott. \"He doesn't really have a weakness.\" Scheffler held off the challenge of Aberg, who was trying to become the first debutant to win the Masters since Fuzzy Zoeller in 1979, and fellow Americans Collin Morikawa and Max Homa in the final round. Aberg is enjoying a meteoric rise in the game, having only turned professional 10 months ago. Since then, he was won events on both the PGA Tour and DP World Tour and played a key role in Europe's Ryder Cup victory over the United States in Rome. Remarkably, this was his first appearance in a a major championship. The 24-year-old briefly tied Scheffler for the lead after a phenomenal birdie putt at the ninth hole, only to see his hopes dashed when he found the water on the 11th. Despite that double-bogey setback, he recovered to birdie the 13th and 14th and finish three clear of those in third. \"I was very nervous, shaking a little bit on the first tee,\" said Aberg. \"We knew that hitting it in the water on 11 wasn't ideal, but we also just kept playing. That's what me and my caddie Joe [Skovron] and our team has been trying to work on. Just keep playing no matter what happens. \"Everyone in my position wants to be a major champion, wants to be world number one and I am no different. \"It's been that way ever since I picked up a golf club. This week solidifies [that] a lot of those things are there. \"Scottie is an unbelievable player and he's proven it again and again. He makes us better - and he makes you want to beat him.\""

        "description": "-6",
        "text": " American trio Scottie Scheffler, Bryson DeChambeau and Max Homa share the lead while Tiger Woods made a record 24th consecutive halfway cut at the Masters. Homa's 71 was one of only eight under par rounds on a blustery day two at Augusta as he improved to six under. Round one leader DeChambeau shot a 73, while Scheffler scrambled a 72. England's Tommy Fleetwood and Danny Willett are five back at one under, but Rory McIlroy's challenge faded with a 77 that leaves him at four over. Willett had been four under on the 18th tee but a wayward drive and taking two shots to get out of a greenside bunker led to a triple-bogey seven. Defending champion Jon Rahm conceded he had been \"fighting all day\" as he signed for a 76 and squeezed into the weekend on five over, one shot inside the cut mark. Woods, who carved out a 72 to reach halfway on one over, insisted after his round that \"anyone who makes the weekend has a chance\". It was a tough day for all the players, with strong and gusting winds playing havoc throughout and contributing to glacially slow play, with balls moving on greens and sand being blown from bunkers. The only player to shoot in the 60s was Masters debutant Ludvig Aberg whose three-under 69 saw him surge into the top seven on two under.  McIlroy, Scheffler and Xander Schauffele were one of the last groups to finish and took six hours and two minutes to complete their 18 holes. Danish debutant Nicolai Hojgaard is two off the lead after mixing four birdies with five bogeys in his 73. He is one ahead of two-time major winner Collin Morikawa and Australian Cameron Davis. Before the tournament, Woods jointly held the record for most consecutive cuts at tournaments played with Fred Couples and Gary Player on 23.  When he began his streak of made cuts in April 1997, 17 of the players in this week's field were not even born. On Friday, Woods needed to finish five holes from round one before swiftly moving into round two.  Previously this year, he had only played 25 holes at a tournament before he withdrew through illness from the second round of the Genesis Invitational in February, so walking 23 in one day was likely to be a challenge. However, despite his physical exertions, the 48-year-old American showed all his nous to navigate a rollercoaster front nine where he carded three birdies and three bogeys. With the wind strengthening as his round progressed, he produced a series of fine par putts and a birdie on the 15th, after dropping a shot at 14, to stay well above the cut line. \"I'm tired. And I'm really really hungry, I could do with some food and some caffeine,\" said the 15-time major champion when asked how he felt after his round. Relive round two as it happened In 87 previous Masters tournaments, the United States have supplied 63 of the winners. At the halfway stage, this edition is heading the same way. World number one Scheffler looked marginally more ruffled in the weather conditions than he had when shooting 66 in the first round but again showed impeccable course management to join the leaders. He briefly dropped two shots back when bogeying the seventh but immediately rebounded with a birdie and held the outright lead midway through his round. An uncharacteristic mistake at the par-five 13th, when he hit his second shot into the stream protecting the green, cost him a shot but he played conservative golf for the rest of his round to ensure he stayed at the top. After an impressive opening round of 65, DeChambeau battled tentative putting and swirling winds to try and maintain his lead. His highlight came at 13 when he found the trees off the tee so opted to play his second down the 14th fairway and then hit his third to 14 feet and holed the birdie putt.  However, he came unstuck at the last when he misjudged the wind when hitting his second shot and ended up 65 feet from the pin. A three-putt bogey followed. \"That was one of the toughest tests of golf I have had in my life,\" said DeChambeau. \"The conditions were so difficult. \"Shooting one over par was not bad. I have a chance and all I can ask for is to play my way into an opportunity come Sunday.\" Meanwhile, Homa, who was playing with Woods, enjoyed a sparkling start, birdieing the second and the fourth to join DeChambeau at the top of the leaderboard on seven under. He briefly led the tournament after DeChambeau bogeyed the fourth and, after dropping a shot on the 11th, he parred his way home. After shooting under par for the first time in six years in his opening round at the Masters on Thursday, McIlroy was only six shots off the lead. However, amid the swirling winds, he went backwards on Friday.  Bogeys at five and seven were followed by a damaging double bogey at the 11th when he found the water.  Rahm also struggled. One over after round one, he made three bogeys plus a double bogey, but found excellent birdies on 15 and 16 to ensure he made the cut. At least they will both play this weekend. The Open champion Brian Harman dropped 11 shots on the final eight holes of his first round early on Friday and although he responded with a level-par 72 in round two, his nine-over total sees him eliminated from the tournament. He was joined on that number by 2015 Masters winner Jordan Spieth, who imploded at the 15th in round one, making a quadruple-bogey nine, and posted a 73 in round two. The 2020 Masters champion Dustin Johnson is also going home after finishing on 13 over. It was also a tough day for England's Justin Rose who dropped five shots to end up at seven over. However, Vijay Singh, who won his Green Jacket in 2000, did make the cut at the age of 61. The popular Fijian bogeyed the 18th to finish one over for round two and four over for the championship."

        "text": " Britain's Emma Raducanu produced a dominant display against Linda Noskova to set up a last-eight meeting with Iga Swiatek at the Stuttgart Open. Raducanu needed 81 minutes to claim a straightforward 6-0 7-5 victory. The 21-year-old will face world number one and defending champion Swiatek in the quarter-finals after the Pole defeated Elise Mertens 6-3 6-4. Swiatek, who is on a nine-match unbeaten run in Stuttgart, has a 2-0 win record against Raducanu. \"It's a match where I have nothing to lose, I can just swing and enjoy it,\" the Briton said. \"We played here two years ago in the quarters, so it's exactly the same. I've come a long way in two years, I've matured a lot and she has obviously achieved so much.\" Raducanu has dropped to 303rd in the world rankings after an injury-hit 2023 season, in which she had wrist and ankle operations. Following Wednesday's win against three-time major winner Angelique Kerber, Raducanu continued her return to form with a no-nonsense performance against Noskova - hitting just just seven unforced errors to the Czech's 31. The 2021 US Open champion raced through the opening set in just 29 minutes, saving two early break points on the way. After losing the first seven games, Noskova eventually managed to hold serve to get herself on the scoreboard and level the second set at 1-1. But despite growing into her service games, the Australian Open quarter-finalist rarely troubled Raducanu's serve and the Briton struck the decisive blow at 6-5 to wrap up the contest. \"This isn't my best, I still have a long way to go. I am just really happy the rewards are starting to come on the match court,\" said Raducanu. \"Going through everything I went through after the US Open and last year, having eight months out with surgery, it gives you new appreciation and there's nothing like playing in front of fans, playing good tennis and building on it match by match.\" Earlier on Thursday, Italy's Jasmine Paolini stunned Tunisian seventh seed Ons Jabeur with a 7-6 (10-8) 6-4 victory. Paolini will face fourth seed Elena Rybakina next after the Kazakh claimed a hard-fought 7-6 (7-3) 1-6 6-4 win against Russia's Veronika Kudermetova. Wimbledon champion Marketa Vondrousova defeated Anastasia Potapova of Russia in straight sets to set up a last-eight encounter with world number two Aryna Sabalenka. Meanwhile, Ukraine's Marta Kostyuk will play American third seed Coco Gauff after saving five match points against China's Zheng Qinwen before going on to beat the Australian Open runner-up 6-2 4-6 7-5.

Three-time Grand Slam champion Murray, 36, ruptured ankle ligaments at the Miami Open last month. Raducanu missed the last eight months of 2023 but has a protected ranking of 103 and is the fifth alternate. If she does not make the main draw because of withdrawals, she will need a wildcard or to come through qualifying. The French Open starts on 26 May. Murray has played at Roland Garros only once since hip resurfacing surgery in 2019, losing in the first round in 2020. The Scot, who won Olympic gold at London 2012 and Rio 2016, said this year that he wants to compete at another Games before he retires. Rafael Nadal, the 14-time French Open champion, is one of five players entered in the main draw to benefit from a protected ranking. The 37-year-old Spaniard, who on Wednesday played his first match since January, is in line to make his first appearance at a Grand Slam since the Australian Open in January 2023. Nadal has indicated that this year will be his last before retiring. 2021 US Open champion Raducanu, 21, played only 10 matches last year but has played 12 this year. On Saturday she helped Great Britain secure a place in the Billie Jean King Cup Finals when coming from a set down to beat France's Diane Parry 4-6 6-1 7-6 (7-1) in Le Portel. Compatriots Katie Boulter and Harriet Dart have direct entry into the main draw along with Jodie Burrage, although the British number three is unlikely to play following wrist surgery last month. Cameron Norrie, Dan Evans and Jack Draper are also on the men's entry list."

        "text": " Former Wimbledon champion Garbine Muguruza has confirmed her retirement from tennis. The Spanish former world number one won Wimbledon in 2017, as well as the French Open the previous year. The 30-year-old announced her retirement in Madrid before the Laureus World Sports Awards. \"The time has come to say goodbye. It's been a long and successful career, but I feel the time is right to retire,\" said Muguruza. Venezuela-born Muguruza has not played since January 2023, and last March said she was taking an extended break from tennis. She turned professional in 2012 and won her first Grand Slam in 2016, defeating Serena Williams in the final of the French Open.  The following year she was victorious at Wimbledon, beating Venus Williams in the final and reaching number one in the world rankings. \"If 25 years ago when I started hitting my first tennis balls someone had told me that I would become a professional tennis player, that I would fulfil my dream of winning Roland Garros and Wimbledon, that I would become number one in the world and win the WTA Finals, I would have thought this person was crazy,\" said Muguruza. \"Tennis has given me a lot in this first part of my life. It has been a fantastic journey in which I have experienced unique situations. I have travelled all over the world and experienced many different cultures.\" Ambition, money and deception: Discover the scandalous true story of Elizabeth Holmes and Theranos Can a quick HIIT workout boost brainpower?

Greece's Tsitsipas, 25, dominated the opening stages and sealed the first set inside 36 minutes.  Norwegian Ruud fought valiantly in a tense second set, which was level at 4-4 before Tsitsipas pulled away in the final two games.  \"It's been a very difficult time for me, so to be back on the podium and winning, it's amazing,\" he said. The victory took Tsitsipas to seventh in the world rankings and he fell to the floor in emotion after his win.  \"I am extremely grateful to my friends, family and everyone behind this journey,\" he added. \"To win three [titles] is just unbelievable - it was a nerve-wracking game but I am extremely happy.\"  The success concluded a significant tournament for Tsitsipas as he also beat top-10 players Alexander Zverev and Jannik Sinner to reach the final. He joined Rafael Nadal, Bjorn Borg, Thomas Muster and Ilie Nastase in the list of players to win three or more titles at Monte Carlo. Tsitsipas committed to a fearless style of play, dominating on the forehand and challenging Ruud's tactics of playing deep from the court. The positivity resulted in a first title since he beat Alex de Minaur in the final at Los Cabos, Mexico, last August - also ending a sketchy start to 2024 for the former French Open and Australian Open runner-up. He broke Ruud's serve in the third game of the first set and the Norwegian, who struggled for fluency, could not recover. The 25-year-old Ruud improved significantly in the second set and a tense seventh game lasted 13 minutes, but Tsitsipas survived three break points. In an impressive all-round performance, he saved all eight break points he faced and converted four of his own eight break opportunities. Both players are set to play in the Barcelona Open in the coming week, where defending champion Carlos Alcaraz has been forced to withdraw with a forearm injury, but Rafael Nadal is set to make his comeback."

        "text": " Rafael Nadal enjoyed a winning start at the Barcelona Open as he returned from another long-term injury in what could be his final year before retirement. The Spanish 22-time major champion, who turns 38 in June, won 6-2 6-3 against inexperienced Italian Flavio Cobolli in their first-round match on Tuesday. Now ranked 644th, Nadal was playing for the first time since January because of a hip injury and abdominal issues. Nadal has indicated 2024 is likely to be his last as a professional player. After pulling out of last year's French Open with the hip problem, the former world number one said he planned to retire at the end of this season. Nadal, who is considered as one of the best players in history and greatest clay-courter of all time, has only played one event since.  But, before making his latest comeback in Barcelona, Nadal said he was not \"putting a deadline\" on his retirement and would only keep playing as long as he felt it was \"worth it\". Live scores, results and order of play Alerts: Get tennis news sent to your phone This win was a positive step, if a somewhat straightforward assignment, as the record 14-time champion aims to return to Roland Garros next month. \"I'm just having fun and happy to start with a victory,\" said Nadal, who faces a tougher opponent next in Australian world number 11 Alex de Minaur. \"I'm going through some tough moments but at the same time when I'm able to be on tour and compete a little bit it means a lot.\" It was intriguing to see what shape Nadal would be in against 62nd-ranked Cobolli, who has only played in the main draw of a Grand Slam twice. A record 12-time champion in Barcelona, Nadal was playing his first clay-court match in 681 days - when he won the 2022 French Open final. There was an air of anticipation as a packed crowd awaited Nadal's arrival on the court which is named in his honour,, external with the gangways on his walk out full of ball kids and tournament staff waiting for a glimpse. A near-standing ovation and huge roar greeted Nadal, while the familiar pre-match foibles - aligning his water bottles, box jumps at the net and zigzagged sprint to the baseline - were also lapped up. It was less certain whether the shot-making and athleticism which they have become accustomed to seeing from Nadal would also return. Doubts had been raised about the impact of the abdominal injury on his serve and, although it appeared he wasn't serving at full tilt, he showed few issues. There was, understandably, some early rust in his groundstrokes before Nadal quickly found fluency from both forehand and backhand wings. With Cobolli looking slightly overawed and showing uncertainty in his shots, Nadal cemented an early break for a 4-1 lead and wrapped up the opening set in 43 minutes. Whipping a trademark forehand winner down the line in the second game of the second set illustrated his growing confidence. Nadal edged a run of three straight breaks and saw out victory by taking his second match point, showing his delight with trademark underarm fist pump. British number one Cameron Norrie is also through to the next round after opponent Harold Mayot retired hurt at the start of the third set. After Norrie took the first set via a tie-break, there was a bizarre interruption the start of the second when Mayot's mobile phone rang and the Frenchman had to run to his bag to turn it off. World number 116 Mayot then began to struggle with what looked like a groin injury that required two medical timeouts, though he still managed to take the second-set tie-break and level the match. But the 22-year-old then retired after falling 30-0 behind in the first game of the decider, with Norrie going through to play Andrea Vavassori of Italy or Spain's Roberto Bautista Agut in the next round."

        "text": " Anne Keothavong says Great Britain's victory over France in the Billie Jean King Cup is \"certainly up there\" with her greatest achievements as captain. Katie Boulter and Emma Raducanu's wins on Saturday saw Britain wrap up their qualifying tie 3-1 and book their place in November's 12-team Finals. It is the first time Great Britain have earned a spot in the Finals by right, having qualified as hosts in 2021. Keothavong said it was a \"huge milestone\" to beat favourites France. \"I'm still in a bit of disbelief. The performances today from Katie and Emma were just incredible, they should be so proud of themselves,\" Keothavong said. \"I'm pleased with not just their performances today but the whole team - it really has been a team effort.\" But how did self-proclaimed underdogs Great Britain beat France on their own turf? There were concerns Raducanu would not be available for the qualifiers following her withdrawal from last month's Miami Open with a lower back injury. But there were no signs of injuries as she produced two gritty comebacks in Le Portel. Against strong-server Garcia, Raducanu matched her opponent for aces, while she withstood a late surge from Parry after missing two match points. \"Tennis-wise I have improved because I feel like I am playing the best tennis of my career and my life,\" Raducanu said. \"To come through the moments that I did the last two days it took a strong character when the whole stadium is pretty much against you.\" After an injury-disrupted 2023 season, it was an achievement in itself that Raducanu managed to stay fit for two three-set matches. Still on her comeback journey from wrist and ankle surgeries, impressive wins against top 50 players on an unfamiliar clay surface provides a promising glimpse of what is to come from the 2021 US Open champion. \"I thought Emma today showed real star quality with her performance,\" Keothavong added. \"She was able to regroup after the initial disappointment. It was just amazing.\" Keothavong and her players have been quick to emphasise the squad's team spirit throughout. After her early loss to Parry, Boulter said she received \"a very sweet message\" from Raducanu that night. \"That was the main thing that got me through Saturday,\" she told BBC Sport. \"It means a lot coming from someone like her. She's such a star.\" Raducanu has been equally quick to praise her team-mates and coaches - and a team bonding trip to Italy could be on the cards. \"Me and Fran [team-mate Francesca Jones] are going to Tuscany and this was the running joke of the week so when we won we shouted 'Tuscany',\" Raducanu explained afterwards. \"The rest of them are invited to our little weekend in Tuscany as well.\" It is fair to say Great Britain are not the most experienced on clay. Boulter's first ever Tour-level match on the surface was against Diane Parry on Friday - a match where she lost 12 games in a row in a 6-2 6-0 defeat. Raducanu, meanwhile, had just six clay wins from 12 outings before this week, compared to French number one Garcia's 131 tour-level victories on the surface. But Boulter and Raducanu used the conditions to their advantage. The former stayed in long rallies, using the slower pace of the courts, while the latter fired in crisp drop shots and powerful returns. \"I kind of lost my identity on day one, I was trying to play like the stereotypical clay court player,\" said Boulter after her win on Saturday. \"But I don't have that in my bag. This is my second match on the tour on clay court, I'm still fresh and learning.\" Live scores, results and order of play Alerts: Get tennis news sent to your phone"

Britain's Raducanu, who is continuing her comeback from an injury-hit 2023 season, lost 7-6 (7-2) 6-3 against the clay-court specialist from Poland. Swiatek is on a 10-match winning run in Stuttgart, having won the last two editions of the WTA 500 tournament. She will face Kazakhstan's fourth seed Elena Rybakina next. Live scores, results and order of play Raducanu, 21, has enjoyed a return to form over the past week, helping Britain beat France in the Billie Jean King Cup at the weekend before wins against three-time major winner Angelique Kerber and Linda Noskova. Her run to the quarter-finals in Stuttgart will see her rise up the world rankings after dropping to 303rd following wrist and ankle operations in 2023. Asked if she thought Raducanu can return to the top level of the sport, Swiatek said: \"I hope she will be able to do it because for sure she has the game for it.\" Raducanu enjoyed a dream start against Swiatek, 22, fighting back from 40-0 down to break the defending champion's opening service game. The four-time major winner broke back immediately and continued to threaten Raducanu's serve throughout the first set, but the Briton held firm to force a tie-break. Swiatek raced through the tie-break before striking the first blow in the second set on her way to a 3-1 lead as a tumble onto the clay floor seemed to momentarily dent Raducanu's confidence. The 2021 US Open champion regained her composure to divert three break points in the fifth game, but the single break of serve in the second set proved enough for Swiatek to wrap up the win after a gruelling two hours and four minutes on court. \"It was a pretty intense match so I am happy I was able to keep the intensity even though we played tough games for over two hours,\" Swiatek said. \"It wasn't easy, I had a lot of break points that I couldn't convert.\" Earlier on Friday, Rybakina booked her last-four spot by defeating Italy's Jasmine Paolini 6-3 5-7 6-3. On the other side of the draw, Wimbledon champion Marketa Vondrousova knocked out world number two Aryna Sabalenka with a 3-6 6-3 7-5 win. Sabalenka has failed to go beyond the quarter-finals of a tournament since her Australian Open triumph in January. The Belarusian, a runner-up in the last three Stuttgart tournaments, committed 48 unforced errors and converted just six of her 15 break points. Vondrousova, the Czech sixth seed, will play Marta Kostyuk next after the Ukrainian secured her second straight top-10 win against US Open champion Coco Gauff. American Gauff sped through the first set in 36 minutes, but Kostyuk, who knocked out China's fifth seed Zheng Qinwen on Thursday, fought back from a break down in both the second and third sets to win 3-6 6-4 7-6 (8-6).

        "text": " Plans to reintroduce a women's tournament at The Queen's Club rest on convincing the ATP Tour the grass courts will remain in good enough condition for the men's event the following week. The LTA and the All England Club want to stage a WTA tournament at Queen's in the first week of the grass court season from 2025. If the ATP can be persuaded then the top women's players would be gracing the courts of the west London club for the first time since 1973. \"We have got high confidence, and we have got significant evidence from the All England Club as to how grass courts wear over a two-week period,\" the LTA chief executive Scott Lloyd said. \"The grass courts at Queen's are perfectly capable of delivering two weeks of professional level tennis. We've got the data. \"We think it would be great for that swing of tournaments and for the women's events, particularly from a visibility and profile perspective.\" The LTA says it has studied weather conditions, the density of the soil and potential wear to areas of the court, such as the baseline.  But male players are understood to be unhappy about the prospect of starting their week on used courts. \"The ATP are important partners of ours and we are working with them to try to ensure that the players are happy and comfortable that the surface can sustain use,\" he continued. \"Typically players are pretty delighted to make it to the second week of Wimbledon and you don't hear them argue too much about the court surface in that scenario. We are very hopeful that there won't be any issues, but we are working through the logistics.\" Logistics include the availability of courts for men who arrive early to practise and the impact on the ATP qualifying event which is held the weekend beforehand. The ATP has been open to the idea of more combined events in recent years but will have to balance that with the wishes of its members. Whether it has the legal cover to block the LTA's plans remains to be seen. A women's event at Queen's would replace Eastbourne as the sole WTA 500 event staged in the UK in the run-up to Wimbledon.  Eastbourne would still host a combined event but, once the WTA event is downgraded to 250 status, there will be greater restrictions on who can enter. As a WTA 500 event is staged in Germany in the same week, no top-10 player would be allowed to enter Eastbourne - unless they are British, or the defending champion.  No more than three top-30 players would be permitted in total, and this at an event which in 2023 played host to half of the world's top 10. \"Eastbourne sells out and we've enjoyed it over a very, very long period of time as a major tournament venue, but the reality of that location is that it is commercially limited to some degree,\" said Lloyd. \"We just think that having a WTA 500 in week one, straight after Roland Garros, will raise the profile of top-level tennis in that period. \"It's not about looking to concentrate our tournaments in London. We will still absolutely support our other venues throughout that calendar, and indeed as you see us doing with Davis Cup and Billie Jean King Cup - whether that's Glasgow, Manchester, Coventry. We want to have that geographical diversity.\" There is no scope for an extra WTA grass-court event in the UK, and, as the LTA now owns the Nottingham Tennis Centre, it is the tournament in Birmingham which is likely to make way for Queen's. The Edgbaston Priory Club first staged a WTA event in 1982, when Billie Jean King won the title. These discussions are taking place as the sport investigates the viability of a 'Premium Tour', which could create a series of more exclusive tournaments. But as that is a long way from becoming reality, other ideas continue to be advanced."

Raducanu came from a set down to hold a 5-2 lead in the third set and had two match points on serve before being pegged back by an inspired Parry. But Raducanu kept her nerve to win 4-6 6-1 7-6 (7-1) and give Britain an unassailable 3-1 lead in Le Portel. Katie Boulter earlier beat Clara Burel 7-5 6-0 to put GB ahead. This was a superb victory for Britain, who were facing a tough task away against a French team that mixed clay-court experience with youthful exuberance. However, Raducanu led the way for Britain, staging comebacks in both her singles ties to beat French number one Caroline Garcia on Friday and then Parry. Saturday's win for Raducanu followed a superbly gritty performance from Boulter, who put aside a chastening loss to Parry to return and beat Burel in convincing fashion. An emotional Raducanu teared up at the end, sharing a warm hug with Parry before the British team celebrated together. \"Being a set down, I was backed up against a wall and I didn't want to go to the doubles because they're a very strong doubles team,\" Raducanu said. \"Boults helped us go 2-1 up and [we had] the support on the bench to help us go out again. \"It's a massive shout-out - it is not just me out there.\" 'Sweet' messages & running jokes - how GB beat France GB beat France to reach BJK Cup Finals - reaction & analysis Live scores, results and order of play Alerts: Get tennis news sent to your phone Neither Raducanu nor Boulter can point to huge experience on clay courts, particularly when compared with the French players who learn their craft on the red dirt. However, both players, marshalled well by captain Anne Keothavong, showed the savvy and big-hitting needed to turn this tie around. As she did against Garcia, Raducanu grew into the contest. She was broken early by Parry, fought back to parity and then faltered as she served to stay in the set. The turning point came after the Briton went an early break up in the second. She withstood a long game of five deuces, saving one break point and keeping Parry and the vocal crowd at bay. Raducanu's forehand cranked up a notch and she took the ball early, stepping in to blast away return winners and set up a deciding set and, at 5-3 in the third, she strode out to serve for the match.  The first match point was brilliantly saved by a passing Parry winner, and the second missed on a Raducanu forehand, before a long backhand from the Briton swung the momentum back towards Parry. Raducanu did well to stave off two break points at 5-5 and again to regroup for the tie-break, producing some of her best serves to secure victory. As well as the satisfaction of her wins, Raducanu has also managed to stay fit and competitive for two matches in two days - a positive in a career that has been hit by injuries. British number one Boulter spoke about needing to be more aggressive on the unfamiliar clay courts after her defeat by Parry. She used her forehand to great effect against Burel on Saturday, but perhaps more impressive was the mental strength she showed to come through the tight moments. She won a near 20-minute game at 3-3 in the first set, saving five break points and surviving nine deuces in front of a raucous French crowd. Although she was broken to love in her next service game, it did not feel as desperate as it did against Parry - and the Englishwoman proved it, breaking a tentative Burel as she served for the set. Boulter's net play also improved as the match progressed. She brought up two points for the first set with an extraordinary reactive lob before closing it out with her trademark forehand. She kept the intensity up too, breaking Burel at the first opportunity in the second set with a deft drop shot, and Boulter kept both her rhythm and her radar in check to sweep to victory. BBC tennis correspondent Russell Fuller Raducanu showed great skill, stamina and nerve to come back from a set down for the second day in a row to secure Great Britain's unlikely triumph. The absence of the French number one Garcia will have given the team a boost at the start of the day. But Boulter, a clay-court novice at the elite level, knew she had to be very good to beat a top 50 player in Burel - and she was. Raducanu was outstanding in establishing a 5-2 third set lead, but the momentum was back with Parry by the start of the tie-break, until the 21-year-old swiftly took the match out of France's hands with some clinical serves and forehands. Winning away on clay against a French team boasting three top 50 players is some achievement for Keothavong and her team. Great Britain featured in the Glasgow finals of 2022, but only as hosts.

Norwegian third seed Ruud defeated the Greek fifth seed 7-5 6-3 to claim the biggest title of his career. It is the first time the 25-year-old, who is ranked sixth in the world, has won an ATP 500-ranked event. \"For me it means a lot, this is my biggest title that I ever won,\" said Ruud. \"It's something I've chased for a long time already. I've never won a 500 before or a 1000.

He then opened up a 4-1 lead in the second set after Tsitsipas hit a forehand into the net to concede a break, before seeing out victory in 91 minutes to end the Greek's 10-match winning streak. The win also avenged Ruud's defeat by Tsitsipas in last week's Monte Carlo Open final.

His match against Italian 21-year-old Flavio Cobolli on Tuesday in Barcelona, where he has won the title a record 12 times, will be his first on clay since winning the final of the 2022 French Open. His return this week does raise hope of him competing next month at Roland Garros, where he has won 14 of his major titles. \"It means a lot to me to be able to play one more time here in Barcelona, a place that I have amazing success and a lot of unforgettable memories,\" he said. \"So, I am just trying to enjoy every moment and I am excited about being on court in a professional tournament again, especially here at home. \"I was not able to spend a lot of days on tour over the last two years, so I just want to enjoy every day I am able to play with the guys on a professional level.

        "text": " Rafael Nadal's injury comeback was ended by Alex de Minaur as the 12-time champion waved goodbye to the Barcelona Open for possibly the final time. Nadal, 37, returned to court on Tuesday after a three-month absence, making light work of 21-year-old Italian Flavio Cobolli in a straight-set win. A day later, Nadal lost 7-5 6-1 to world number 11 De Minaur in round two. Nadal, a 22-time major winner, has indicated he plans to retire in 2024 if he is unable to compete regularly. The former world number one, now ranked 644th, has only played five matches since January 2023 because of hip and abdominal injuries. Nadal is hoping to be fit enough to make a return to the French Open, where he won a record 14 men's singles titles,next month and suggested he was preserving his energy for Roland Garros during the latter stages of the De Minaur match. \"On a personal level, for what is to come, the 6-1 in the second set is what had to happen today,\" he said. \"It wasn't today that I had to give everything and die. I have to give myself the chance to do that [at the French Open] in a few weeks, or at least try to.\" Facing a player of De Minaur's pedigree was always likely to be a considerable step up, and a truer test of his level than his comeback outing against 62nd-ranked Cobolli. The 25-year-old Australian examined Nadal's movement by using drop shots early in the match, an effective tactic which helped him move 2-0 in front and tee up another break point for 3-0. But Nadal survived to hold and improved his level, producing a number of explosive cross-court backhand winners as he fought back to lead 4-3. Another backhand winner, this time down the line, even drew a clap of the strings from De Minaur and teed up another break point for Nadal. Taking the chance would have left Nadal serving for the set, but De Minaur recovered and won 19 of the next 24 points to win an opener lasting more than an hour. After so long out, and with playing on consecutive days, Nadal's endurance was always going to be tested, particularly against an opponent known for his athleticism. De Minaur played smartly in a one-sided second set and broke Nadal's serve three times, silencing the Barcelona crowd in the process, to secure an impressive victory. Nadal left the court bearing his name - for what could be the final time - to a standing ovation and rapturous send-off. Meanwhile, British men's number two Jack Draper reached his 10th ATP Tour quarter-finals at the BMW Open in Munich. Draper, 22, fought back after a rain delay to earn a 4-6 6-1 6-1 win over German world number 179 Rudolf Molleker at the clay-court event.

        "publication_date": "2023-05-30T11:06:53.000Z",
        "description": "Watch Gods of Tennis on ",
        "text": " A new BBC documentary series - Gods of Tennis - takes viewers back to the 1970s and 1980s to explore how a generation of megastars truly put the sport on the map. Over the course of two decades, players such as Bjorn Borg, John McEnroe, Billie Jean King, Arthur Ashe, Chris Evert and Martina Navratilova became tennis' first major celebrities. Tracy Austin, who won the US Open in 1979 aged just 16, remembers Borg being treated by fans as if he were one of the Beatles. Commercial success followed, and some players used their increased profile to help drive social change. Austin describes Ashe and King as \"incredible champions\" but adds what they did off the court was \"probably bigger\". Across three hour-long episodes, Gods of Tennis speaks to the players who were there. Here are just a few takeaways...   In 1973, Ashe was the first black professional to play in the South African Championships. It came at a time when the country was still under Apartheid rule. Ashe, who grew up under segregation in Virginia in the United States, made his participation contingent on one stipulation. \"He demanded the tournament had to be integrated,\" says South African author Mark Mathabane. For the first time in South African history, Mathabane adds, black people were able to play and spectate at the tournament. Ashe may have been beaten in the final by fellow American Jimmy Connors, but to Mathabane he was the real winner. \"He made numberless black people in South Africa realise Apartheid is based on a lie,\" he says. Already a US Open winner by that stage, Ashe went on to win the Australian Open and Wimbledon. When Billie Jean King won the 1972 US Open, her prize money was $10,000. The men's champion - Ilie Nastase - took home $25,000. The following year, King formed the Women's Tennis Association (WTA), with a mission to achieve equal pay. Later in 1973 came an unlikely episode in that campaign - a bizarre, one-off match known as 'The Battle of The Sexes' in which King, 29, took on 55-year-old former men's world number one (and self-proclaimed male chauvinist) Bobby Riggs.  Austin told BBC Sport it \"wasn't just a tennis match, it became an event around the world\". In the build-up to the televised match, Riggs made it plain he felt women were inferior to men. King saw him off in straight sets. Briton Sue Barker, who would later win the French Open, recalls how important it felt. She remembers her coach calling to say: \"Your hobby has just become a career.\" Later that year, the US Open introduced equal pay for male and female players. The Australian Open began offering equal prize money in 1984, but reversed that decision in 1996, then again in 2001. The French Open and Wimbledon introduced parity in 2007. The series shows how Borg became tennis' first pin-up in the 1970s. Towards the end of the decade, though, a perfect foil for the smooth Swede emerged in the form of brash American McEnroe. The New Yorker became infamous for his on-court outbursts. \"Every time he played a match at Wimbledon, he was basically going against the decorum of the event,\" says Austin. In 1981, McEnroe yelled the immortal words \"you cannot be serious!\" after umpire Edward James called a ball out. It became a catchphrase. McEnroe admits in the series he felt \"misunderstood\" at the time. \"I knew I was right,\" he says. \"But they wouldn't say 'look, I missed it, sorry' just once.\" Borg won 11 Grand Slam singles titles before retiring at the age of 26. McEnroe retired with seven to his name. Chris Evert v Martina Navratilova was an era-defining rivalry for women's tennis. Navratilova won nine Wimbledon singles titles and 167 singles titles overall on tour - both of which are records. Despite those achievements, she was \"always searching for people to love her and understand her\", according to rival Evert. Navratilova was born in Prague but defected to the United States. She came out as bisexual in 1981 - months after King was publicly outed - and has since identified as a lesbian. The emotion of it all came to the fore at the US Open final that year, when the crowd gave Navratilova a standing ovation as she received her runners-up medal. \"I didn't cry because I lost the match,\" says Navratilova. \"I cried because I felt accepted. I always wanted to belong and now I'm a citizen and I'm gay and they're still clapping.\" What's the story of the 'Indian Titanic'?

        "text": " Britain's Emma Raducanu continued her revival in form with a straight-set win over Angelique Kerber in the Stuttgart Open first round. Raducanu was rarely troubled by the former world number one and wrapped up a 6-1 6-2 win in one hour 26 minutes. It was the 21-year-old's third win in a week after she won both her matches to help Britain beat France in the Billie Jean King Cup at the weekend. Raducanu will play Linda Noskova of the Czech Republic in next round. \"It was very difficult to play Angie because she has so much history behind her,\" said Raducanu. \"You are not just playing Angelique Kerber, you are playing the person who has achieved all those amazing results. \"It wasn't the prettiest but I just focused on the next point and did not get too bogged down. So I'm happy to have got through that.\" Both players entered the tournament as wildcards, with Raducanu dropping to 303 in the world after having surgery on both wrists last year.  Three-time major winner Kerber meanwhile only returned to the tour in December after 18 months out following the birth of her first child. Raducanu broke serve three times in a dominant first set, taking it 6-2 in just 41 minutes, before breaking in the first game of the second. Kerber, 36, was able to break back immediately but then began to tire and an increasingly confident Raducanu was able to reel off four consecutive games to seal victory. Earlier on Wednesday, American world number three Coco Gauff overcame an error-strewn display to beat fellow American Sachia Vickery 6-3 4-6 7-5. The US Open champion, playing her first tournament since the Miami Open in March, made 49 unforced errors, including 14 double faults. She looked on the brink of defeat when trailing 4-2 in the deciding set, but won five of the next six games to seal victory in two hours 26 minutes. Two-time Wimbledon finalist Ons Jabeur snapped a five-match losing win by beating Russia's Ekaterina Alexandrova 2-6 6-3 7-6 (7-1).  Tunisia's Jabeur, ranked in ninth in the world, has struggled with physical issues this season and had not won since beating Raducanu in Abu Dhabi on 7 February. Meanwhile, former world number one Naomi Osaka lost 6-4 6-2 to Italy's Martina Trevisan on her clay-court comeback at the WTA 250 event in Rouen. The 26-year-old Japanese player, whose four major titles have come on hard courts, had not played on clay since a first-round defeat at the 2022 French Open.

        "text": " World champion Luke Humphries followed his victory in Brighton with another night win in Nottingham to move top of the Premier League table. Humphries defeated Michael Smith and Peter Wright to reach the final, in which he beat Nathan Aspinall 6-3. The 29-year-old has overtaken Michael van Gerwen at the summit, after the Dutchman lost a high-quality quarter-final to teenager Luke Littler. Littler then lost 6-3 to fellow Englishman Aspinall in the last four. Neither Humphries nor Aspinall hit top gear in the final, but it was the world number one who came through to create a two-point gap at the top of the table. \"Every point matters now,\" he told Sky Sports. \"Last year I think 24 points got you through, but it's really close. Everybody's quite tight and it's going to maybe take a lot more points this year than it did last year to get you into those semi-final places. \"Obviously I'd love to finish top, that would be amazing, but finishing in the top four would just be what I want. \"I'm still learning and it's tough because you're playing the best players week in and week out.\" Littler, who like Humphries is in his Premier League debut campaign, has won six of his seven quarter-finals but has reached only one final and is yet to clinch a night win. Against three-time world champion Van Gerwen, the 17-year-old averaged 114 and narrowly missed out on a nine-dart finish in what proved to be the final leg of his 6-2 victory. Van Gerwen has followed his three consecutive night wins early in the tournament with three successive quarter-final exits, although he showed close to his best form with an average of almost 111. Scot Wright won a match for the first time in the 2024 competition, beating Gerwyn Price in the deciding leg of his quarter-final, but Humphries proved too strong in the next round.

Littler said he watched the Premier League football match backstage as United, who had been 3-2 up in the final minutes, conceded twice deep into stoppage time. \"I was in a bad mood. I was like, 'I'm winning this now'. It gave me motivation,\" the teenager said. \"There were a few Manchester United fans on the walkout so I was glad to win.\" Littler raced into a three-leg lead against Price, who hit a nine-darter in his semi-final, and saw out the win. The five points for the win puts Littler in a strong position to qualify for the play-offs at London's O2 Arena on 23 May. \"I'm glad I won,\" Littler told Sky Sports. \"I've definitely settled into it [the Premier League]. The first five or six weeks, I won then lost and lost. I've grown in confidence. \"There's still six weeks to go, but I'm sure if I keep getting two or three points a week I will get into the play-offs.\" Premier League Darts night 10 in Manchester - as it happened Littler was spectacular in Belfast last week but, despite not reaching those levels in front of a raucous 11,000 crowd, this was another reminder of the innate talent he has. He beat Michael van Gerwen 6-3 in the quarter-finals, despite only averaging 93.15, but it was another disappointing night for the Dutchman who has now lost five of his past six quarter-finals. Littler faced Nathan Aspinall in the semi-finals, and unusually he probably had the crowd against him with The Asp from nearby Stockport. It was again scrappy from Littler, who averaged 97.63, but two 100-plus checkouts saw him edge past the in-form Aspinall with a 6-4 win. Price was superb in his quarter-final and semi-final, averaging more than 100 in both, and taking out 10 of 16 doubles. Ultimately the strong start that Littler had in the final saw him get over the line, but Price has renewed his chances of making the play-offs. \"Luke [Littler] coming along and doing what he's doing has kind of changed my opinion about how things should be done,\" said World Championship semi-finalist Wayne Mardle to Sky Sports. \"He's opened my eyes up. He's not sticking to convention. \"Tonight we've seen more of the real Luke Littler than we've ever seen. What he did last week was great, but he won differently this week, it was just honest darts. It was just 'I love this'. I thought he was magnificent and I want to see more of that.\" Elsewhere, there was a second successive quarter-final exit for world number one and world champion Luke Humphries, and the Crewe man has now lost top spot. Peter Wright suffered an eighth first-round defeat and remains rooted to the foot of the table.

        "text": " Luke Humphries produced three superb displays to win night six of Premier League Darts in Brighton. The world champion, 29, beat Gerwyn Price 6-2, Rob Cross 6-3 and Michael Smith 6-3 for his first ever night win, which lifts him to second in the table. Humphries' victory cut Michael van Gerwen's lead at the top of the standings to three points. Van Gerwen went out in the quarter-final for the second consecutive week, losing 6-2 to Cross. Two-time world champion Peter Wright missed two match darts in the deciding leg of his quarter-final defeat by Smith and the Scot remains without a win in this year's competition. Smith, who won night one in Cardiff, then beat 17-year-old Luke Littler in his semi-final but lost against the man that replaced him as world number one in January. Premier League darts night six as it happened Speaking after his victory, Humphries, who lost to Dimitri van den Bergh in Sunday's UK Open final, told Sky Sports: \"I've felt like I haven't played my best since the World Championship, maybe for the first six weeks, and I've come back playing a lot better. \"Sometimes it takes a bit of time to get used to all of the scenarios of what you're going through. \"The UK Open [reaching the final] was a massive boost for me. I know I didn't win it but my game was in a good place, I played well. \"I've come here today and upped my game even more. There have been a couple of runners-up [trophies] since then [winning the world title] so it's nice to have a winners' trophy.\" Littler, who reached the World Championship final aged 16 at the start of the year, has consistently won matches in his debut Premier League campaign but a first night win continues to elude him. He beat night five champion Nathan Aspinall 6-3 to reach the semi-final stage for the fifth time in six outings, but failed to make his second final as Smith flew 3-0 ahead in their meeting and eventually won 6-3.

        "text": " Teenager Luke Littler continued his extraordinary rise as he won his first Premier League Darts night with a 6-4 win over Nathan Aspinall in Belfast. Littler, 17, rose to prominence when he was runner-up to Luke Humphries in the World Darts Championship on debut. The Premier League debutant had reached the final in week two in Berlin but lost to Michael van Gerwen. He beat Humphries, who defeated him in January's World final, in the quarter-finals, and Van Gerwen in the semis. The win leaves Littler second in the eight-player Premier League Darts table with the top four progressing to the play-offs on 23 May at London's O2 Arena.  \"I'm happy to win,\" Littler told Sky Sports. \"I've practised more tonight and it has paid off. \"I've got to enjoy it. If you don't enjoy it, you won't perform or play well.\" Since his defeat in January's World final, Littler has won the Bahrain Masters and the Players Championship One event as he continues his rise through the sport. His Premier League campaign has been up and down, with two quarter-final defeats in the opening eight weeks, but this win puts him on track to reach the play-offs. His 6-5 defeat by Van Gerwen in Berlin on night two has not fazed him, with the Warrington-born teenager looking more relaxed as the weeks go by.  Relive night nine of Premier League Darts in Belfast 'It's on another level, completely alien in darts' - how Littler handles demand He has changed his throw over the past few weeks too, pausing before releasing, showing immense courage to do that on the biggest stage but it is paying dividends.  He started the final against Aspinall, who was in his fourth final of the year, with a superb 136 checkout in the opening leg.  Stockport-born Aspinall, who won night five in Exeter, broke in leg three, but Littler got the game back on throw with an outrageous bullseye, 25, bullseye finish in leg six.  He broke again in leg eight, but Aspinall broke straight back and a decider seemed certain. Littler missed match darts in the 10th leg but was able to come back and tidy up for the win after Aspinall failed to take out 113.  For Littler this was further progress and he is consistently beating the best players in the world, with his record against Humphries, who was seeking a record-breaking fourth successive nightly win, now at 4-0 since his World final defeat.  He is also 3-3 against Van Gerwen, who has won the Premier League a record seven times.  Elsewhere, there was just a second quarter-final win of the season for Peter Wright, but Gerwyn Price and Rob Cross continue to struggle and are in danger of being cut adrift from the play-off race.

Littler, 17, beat Rob Cross in Wieze in a close final 8-7 to claim the \u00c2\u00a330,000 winner's prize money. The nine darter put Littler 6-5 up but Cross pushed him all the way and the teenager took victory with a 103.76 average in the final. \"I hit the nine and then lost the next two legs, so I'm just glad to get over the line,\" Littler said.  \"It's always good to be involved in a good game. We always push ourselves to the last leg.\" Cross, competing in his ninth European Tour final, was full of praise for his opponent. \"He really pushes on,\" Cross said. \"I wanted a big display and got a big display. To be fair, I missed a few chances, but I've loved this crowd this weekend. \"This young man has got such a bright future in front of him. The nine-darter was impeccable, amazing. This boy's special.\" On his way to the title, the World Championship runner-up made 30 maximum 180s - a European Tour record. Littler appeared to exchange words on the stage with his semi-final opponent, Ricardo Pietreczko, after the German was defeated 7-3. After the match, Pietreczko criticised Littler, writing on Instagram: \"So I appreciated him a lot, that you can play such a game at such an age, but I hope the arrogance punishes him.\" Littler responded on Twitter by saying: \"No idea what I did wrong, no idea what he said, something then don't do it again.\" The teenager also had wins over Damon Heta and Jermaine Wattimena on his way to the title, while Cross made it to the final with a 7-3 victory over Wales' Gerwyn Price in his semi-final."

Van den Bergh led 10-8 but missed six darts at doubles for victory, before Humphries fought back to level. Humphries had two match darts of his own to clinch the title in the decider. The Belgian then secured his second major title and his first in front of a crowd, his 2020 World Matchplay success having come during the Covid pandemic. Van den Bergh, who beat Australia's Damon Heta 11-6 in his semi-final, dominated the first half of the final against the world number one from England. The 29-year-old led 7-2 and 8-4, helped by a superb 130 checkout in the 12th leg, and did not trail at any point in the final. Five match darts were missed in the 19th leg, as was a further attempt to win it in the 20th, but he took the decider with his first dart at double top to clinch the \u00c2\u00a3110,000 first prize. Van den Bergh credited his work with a sports psychologist as a major factor in his win. He was cheered after he landed the winning double and when lifting the trophy, but earlier drew the ire of the Minehead crowd. At 10-8, he took several seconds to compose himself by his drinks table before throwing for the match. He told ITV4: \"There was a moment when I was 10-8 up and I was like 'I'm one leg away, I can win this' and I lost it. I just lost it. I lost my guts, but all of a sudden it turned around.\" Former PDC World Championship quarter-finalist Chris Mason, working as a pundit for the channel, said: \"There was no real need for it - he just wanted to take the absolute pace out of the game and there was a shake of the head from Luke. \"You're into the 19th leg of the match and it's the nonchalant way of putting his hand in his pocket. \"It just ruined what was an amazing final. He's not bending any rules. It's verging on gamesmanship, but it is what it is.\" Humphries, who also lost in the UK Open final in 2021, said: \"I've had a long five days on the road and I am absolutely shattered. \"I was flagging a little bit in the semi-final, but when you get into a final you don't know if that energy will come back. \"I was very lucky to get two darts at the end. I'll obviously be gutted because I missed two darts, but Dimitri played a good game. A couple of big shots at the start really hurt, but I did my best.\""

        "text": " Former darts commentator Tony Green, also known for his role on television show Bullseye, has died aged 85. Bullseye creator Andrew Wood announced the news on Monday, saying Green \"passed away peacefully today after a long battle with Alzheimer's\". Green was a BBC commentator at the BDO World Championships from 1978 to 2016. He was also more widely known for being the scorer and announcer on long-running quiz show Bullseye, hosted by Jim Bowen on ITV between 1981 and 1995. Green's death was announced on Bullseye's Facebook page with \"a very heavy heart\" by Wood and his family. \"Our love, thoughts and prayers go out to all of Tony's family, who we hold such affection for, to all of Tony friends and those who were lucky enough to work with him,\" they said. \"Thank you Tony for all the memories, all the laughs (and trust us there were many!) and all the special times filming Bullseye together. \"What wonderful years those were and we are honoured to have shared them with you.\" Bobby George, a two-time BDO finalist and long-time BBC commentator, was among a number of former players to express their sadness at Green's death. \"So sorry and sad to hear of Tony Green's passing. He was a good dart player, caller, commentator and an icon of the Bullseye show,\" said George. Keith Deller, who won the BDO title in 1983, described Green as \"one of the great darts commentators\". Philip Bernie, interim director of BBC Sport, said Green was \"truly a legendary figure\". \"He was a wonderful commentator on it for the BBC for nearly 40 years, where the great warmth and generosity of his personality always shone through. He served the sport he loved brilliantly,\" added Bernie."

Van Gerwen held his throw in the opening leg but then lost eight on the spin to suffer the heavy defeat.  Humphries averaged 112.66, which is the second highest in a European Tour final, and took out two scores of 100-plus, including 170 to win leg eight. \"These are the levels you need to be to win these days, that's how crazy it's got,\" said Humphries. \"I look up to Michael a lot and beating him in another final is fantastic. I just love playing him to be honest, he shows a lot of respect and the game just goes on.  \"It was a great final, but I was just unbeatable.\" The 29-year-old - who received a bye in the first round - overcame Luke Woodhouse, Ryan Joyce, Danny Noppert and Gerwyn Price to reach the final. \"At this moment he is the best player. We all have to face him and battle and we have to get back on top,\" said Van Gerwen. \"He'll know it won't last forever though, but he's playing some cracking darts.\"  The event was the second of 13 PDC European Tour events on the 2024 PDC Pro Tour.  It is Humphries' sixth European tour success, while Van Gerwen was appearing in a record-extending 48th final.  Teenager Luke Littler failed to qualify for the event in Munich but won the opening event of the tour in Wieze, Belgium in March.

The Dutchman had won three nights on the spin from night two to four, but had been eliminated in five of the past six quarter-finals. He showed glimpses of his best to beat Littler, who was aiming for a record-equalling third successive night win. Littler tops the table ahead of world champion Luke Humphries and Van Gerwen. All three are in a strong position to reach the play-offs at London's O2 Arena on 23 May.  \"I had to go really deep tonight,\" the 34-year-old Van Gerwen told Sky Sports.  \"When you have to grind and dig deep, it is always nice. Nights like this give you confidence, it does something for you. The fighting spirit in my body is still there, I'm feeling good and confident. \"I'm going to win more than four nights.\" Premier League Darts night 11 in Birmingham - as it happened It was a strange night in Birmingham, with the atmosphere slightly subdued compared to previous weeks, and differing levels of darts on show. Littler's 6-5 semi-final win over Humphries was sublime, with the teenager making it six successive wins against the man who beat him in January's World Championship final. The 17-year-old trailed 2-0 before winning five legs in a row, but Humphries forced a decider and had the throw but Littler, who averaged 107.23, claimed it.  Van Gerwen, who has the past two Premier League titles, overcame Nathan Aspinall 6-4 in the quarter-finals and, despite only averaging 93.28, beat Michael Smith by the same margin in the semi-finals. There were moments of brilliance in the final, including a 125 checkout from Van Gerwen, but there were plenty of scrappy darts with the Dutchman averaging 90.38 and Littler 88.12. They exchanged four successive breaks in leg three to six, before Van Gerwen claimed three in a row to seal the success. It was a much-needed return to form for the three-time world champion, with his play-off place starting to look in doubt after the poor run.  Elsewhere, there was a ninth quarter-final exit for Peter Wright, with the Scot still firmly rooted to the bottom of the table.  Rob Cross lost a decider against Littler in the quarter-finals to lose in the opening round for the fifth week in a row, while last week's beaten finalist Gerwyn Price is also being cut adrift from the play-off spots in seventh after a first-round defeat to Smith.

Each of the eight players is guaranteed to face the other seven in the quarter-finals in weeks 1-7 and 9-15, with weeks 8 and 16's fixtures done off the table. It means we'll get fourth v fifth in Sheffield on the final league-stage night, with the play-off spots potentially on the line. Players earn two points per quarter-final win, an additional point if they win their semi-final and five for winning the night.  The top four players after the group-stage progress to the play-off night at London's O2 Arena on 23 May, with first facing fourth and second against third in a best-of-19 leg match. The final, which is the best of 21 legs, follows.

        "text": " Germany's Martin Schindler upset third seed Gerwyn Price to claim the first PDC title of his career at the International Darts Open on Sunday. Price, 39, was the two-time defending champion and has won the European Tour event a record four times overall. The Welshman led the final but 27-year-old Schindler fought back to win 8-5, cheered on by a home crowd in Riesa. He became the latest winner on the European Tour - 10 years after working for PDC Europe as a steward. At one point the world number 24 was two legs down to the 2021 world champion, but he recovered to clinch victory and become just the third German player to win a PDC title. Schindler's previous best on the European Tour was reaching the semi-finals of last year's event in Riesa and the German Darts Grand Prix two weeks ago, which was won by current world champion Luke Humphries.  The third European Tour event of this year's schedule saw Humphries dealt an early exit at the hands of Stephen Bunting, losing 6-4, while fellow top-10 players Nathan Aspinall, Rob Cross and Damon Heta joined him in being knocked out in the third round. Cross' conqueror Ritchie Edhouse was beaten 6-5 in the quarter-finals by Bunting, who then lost 7-5 in the semis to Price - a 6-5 winner over Ross Smith in the quarters. After getting past Heta, Ryan Searle lost 6-2 to Chris Dobey and despite dumping out Aspinall, Danny Noppert lost 6-5 to Schindler. The home favourite brushed aside Dobey 7-3 in the semis before sealing a memorable evening, dropping to his knees in disbelief after overcoming Price."

        "text": " Imagine sharing stages or sofas with Sir Lenny Henry, David Tennant, Davina McCall, Millie Bobby Brown, Raye, Jonathan Ross and Matt Lucas. It would take most entertainers years to check off such a list on their showbiz rounds - teenage darts sensation Luke Littler did it in a week. The youngest ever PDC World Championship finalist is flying on the oche - and his profile is soaring off it. \"It's just been crazy - since the World Championships, it's changed my life,\" the 17-year-old said. So how is the youngster, who has earned more than \u00c2\u00a3350,000 in prize money in the past three months, handling such a rapid rise into the spotlight? What has Littler's emergence done for darts? Littler's manager is Martin Foulds, whose ZXF Sports Management firm also looks after other top players including World Matchplay champion Nathan Aspinall. Foulds believes Littler's amazing ascent is unparalleled - and says interest in the teenager is non-stop. \"It's just another level, completely alien to anything that has happened in the darting world,\" Foulds said. The 40-year-old estimates he receives \"20 to 40 emails, phone calls, messages, minimum\" about Littler every day from commercial or media organisations. \"I probably spend 70% of my working day dealing with Luke-related enquiries - calls, messages, Zooms, Teams meetings, media requirements,\" Foulds added. Littler has even had to put on hold the driving lessons he was desperate to begin taking when he turned 17, so tough is it to find time in his schedule. Already in 2024, Littler has flown to Bahrain, the Netherlands, Germany and Belgium as well as playing each week in the Premier League and other PDC tournaments across the UK. But Foulds insists his schedule is being managed carefully to avoid any chance of burnout. Littler was one of several top players to withdraw from a recent tournament in Germany, a call made easier by the fact he's already lifted two ranking titles. \"It's given him such an advantage [winning those events] - he's pretty much in every TV event for the rest of the year without throwing another dart,\" Foulds said. \"There's no off-season in darts. You've got to travel to these events - you don't just time-warp and you're in Belfast, Graz, Munich, Rotterdam. \"It's unsustainable for any player to travel and play all of those events. When you're playing in the Premier League especially, travelling can take its toll on anybody. \"He's still a teenager, still 17 - if he wasn't playing darts, he's be doing an apprenticeship or still be in school. So there are duties of care we have to follow to look after Luke as best as we can.\" Not that it's easy to tear him away from the game. \"The other day he had to come in, do some paperwork, some shirt signings - he's sat in my meeting room and he's got two phones on with two different streams of the Players Championship,\" Foulds said, laughing. \"He's not at the darts but he's still watching it - he just loves the game.\" Join the BBC Sport WhatsApp channels Ascending to the top of the darts world within just months is one thing - Littler has been training, practising, honing his skills since he was a toddler with that end goal. Adapting to becoming a household name in the blink of an eye, and taking it all in his stride, is perhaps even more impressive. In the space of a week, he's appeared on Comic Relief on BBC One, the Jonathan Ross Show on ITV, and Fantasy Football League with Matt Lucas on Sky. \"It's clearly unprecedented,\" PDC chief executive Matt Porter told BBC Sport. \"But it's been really encouraging how professionally and maturely he's dealt with the scenarios put in front of him. \"He's taken to it like a duck to water. You feel like he's been there for a long time, he's composed, he's calm, he enjoys himself. \"There are a lot of demands on his time, but there are a lot of benefits and rewards as well.\" Littler's life since mid-December has been the stuff of dreams for most sports-mad teens. He's had Premier League footballers asking him for photos, met Sir Alex Ferguson and other Manchester United heroes and received messages from David Beckham. He got to speak to United boss Erik ten Hag and played darts at the Red Devils' training ground with Harry Maguire and Christian Eriksen. He has more than 1.2million followers on Instagram and another 178,000-plus on X. \"He's modest and intelligent enough to understand he's in a fortunate position and he's grateful for those opportunities - but he's earned them,\" added Porter. Porter says Littler doesn't get \"starry-eyed or star-struck\" - which is apparent to anyone who has seen him play. Just a few months into life as a professional, he's already beaten virtually all of the game's top names. \"When I was 16 I was playing with Lego and Playmobil - this guy is something else, he's on another level,\" ex-world champion Raymond van Barneveld told Sky Sports after his World Championship exit to Littler. His world final defeat to Luke Humphries was Sky Sports' biggest non-football peak - and largest darts audience - attracting 3.71 million viewers. But it has not been all sunshine and roses. Littler's showmanship on the oche has rubbed up the odd player the wrong way, with Germany's Ricardo Pietreczko accusing him of \"arrogance\" after an unconventional checkout route. That is a verdict Foulds firmly rejects. \"It's just the way he is - he just enjoys playing darts, it's fun for him, he loves entertaining,\" Foulds said. \"You've got three darts in your hand, it's up to you which way you go. There's no right or wrong way.\" Of course, all this wouldn't be happening if the World Championship had been a flash in the pan. But he has kicked on massively, beating Aspinall and world champions Gerwyn Price and Michael van Gerwen to reign in Bahrain in January. He lifted a Players Championship title in February, plus the Belgian Open crown in March - and has hit three magical televised nine-dart finishes too. \"Anything he does now doesn't surprise me - he's just ridiculously good, he's got something special,\" Littler's former junior coach Karl Holden told BBC Sport. \"He's always surpassed everything I've thought he could do. I've thought 'he can't get much better, this lad' - and then he's always got better.\" Foulds says Littler has \"two different personas\". \"You've got the off-screen, off-stage one - he's quite shy and humble, just wants to talk with his mates, play a game, spends a lot of time on his phone like most teenagers,\" Foulds said. \"But when he gets on the stage it's like something switches - he's in his element. He loves the arenas, the more fans the better. He seems to thrive with bigger crowds.\" \"The phrase people are using is 'generational talent' and I think that's quite appropriate,\" added PDC chief Porter. \"He's clearly done more than the majority of youth talents have done - not just in darts but in any sport. \"He's opened up some doors to a new audience for us - darts was on an upward curve anyway but he's accelerated that growth.\" You can follow the PDC Premier League action every Thursday with BBC Sport's live text commentary.

        "text": " Luke Humphries believes only two players in the world are capable of beating him on current form after winning night eight of Premier League Darts in Dublin. World champion Humphries won a third successive night in the competition by beating Michael Smith 6-2 in the final. Humphries is now seven points clear at the top of the table as the competition reached its halfway point. \"I'm not arrogant at all,\" Humphries told Sky Sports. \"But I feel like if I play my 'A' game, there are only a couple of people who can test me in that manner; I think Luke Littler and Michael van Gerwen are the two that can push me and their 'A' level can beat me.\" Humphries' win in Dublin, where he averaged more than 105 across victories over Smith, Nathan Aspinall and Peter Wright, saw him claim a night victory for the third week on the trot, having also recently won in Brighton and Nottingham. \"Anything can happen and if I don't keep playing like this then anybody can beat me,\" Humphries, 29, added.  \"I feel like I'm playing the best darts in the world, especially in the past six or seven months consistently, but there are so many great players and anything can happen every week.\" Humphries grew his lead over Michael van Gerwen at the top of the table after the Dutchman was knocked out in the quarter-finals by Gerwyn Price. Welshman Price ended a run of four straight quarter-final exits with a dramatic 6-5 victory. Price had led 4-1 and missed a match dart against Van Gerwen, but held on to win 6-5. For Van Gerwen, who won three straight nights in Berlin, Glasgow and Newcastle earlier this year, it is now four successive quarter-final exits. Price lost the chance to reach the final for the first time since the opening night in Cardiff, missing a dart at bull in  his 6-5 semi-final loss to Smith, who won the deciding leg with a 104 checkout. Littler dropped from third to fifth in the table after suffering defeat in the quarter-finals against Smith. Despite leading 3-1, Smith rallied back and took advantage of inconsistency from Littler to win 6-4. Wins over Littler and Price for Smith saw him climb two places from sixth to fourth in the table. Night nine of the league phase will take place in Belfast on Thursday, 28 March.

Aspinall showed his fighting qualities for a comeback semi-final triumph over world champion Luke Humphries. And he maintained the momentum against Smith to claim his second night victory and move above Michael van Gerwen into third place in the table. Humphries returned to the top on a night where players complained of breezy conditions in the big arena. Stockport thrower Aspinall won five consecutive legs to overcome Humphries 6-4 in the semi-finals on his way to a second success of the campaign after victory in Exeter on night five. \"I've got a reputation of being behind, digging deep and winning games. My opponent might be 4-0 up but in my head I'm better so if you can win four legs, so can I. That was a big win against Luke Humphries tonight,\" Aspinall told Sky Sports. \"Me and Smithy are really good mates. We're going on holiday together next week so it might be a bit awkward.\" Aspinall led 5-3 before Smith hit a stunning 170 checkout in the following leg. But after missing three match darts, the Asp wrapped up victory with double eight. The 2023 world champion Smith won a last-leg decider against Gerwyn Price to reach the final. Night 12: All the action as it happened in Rotterdam Home favourite Van Gerwen was unhappy with the wind in the Rotterdam Ahoy Arena as he went down 6-4 to Humphries in the quarter-finals. Teenager Luke Littler had topped the table and started brightly in his opener against Smith with a 164 checkout but his opponent edged the finishing to claim a 6-3 win. Rob Cross suffered his sixth successive opening-round defeat as he went down 6-3 to Price. And Peter Wright recorded his lowest TV average of 77.48 as he remains rooted to the foot of the table after a 6-2 loss to Aspinall.

Each of the eight players is guaranteed to face the other seven in the quarter-finals in weeks 1-7 and 9-15, with weeks 8 and 16's fixtures done off the table. It means we will get fourth v fifth in Sheffield on the final league-stage night, with the play-off spots potentially on the line. Players earn two points per quarter-final win, an additional point if they win their semi-final and five for winning the night.  The top four players after the group stage progress to the play-off night at London's O2 Arena on 23 May, with first facing fourth and second against third in a best-of-19-leg match. The final, which is the best of 21 legs, follows.

The 17-year-old averaged 103.38 as he beat Dave Chisnall 10-5 in the last 16. World Championship runner-up Littler became favourite for the event after Michael van Gerwen lost to Mensur Suljovic on Friday. The draw has now opened up further with defeats for former world champions Michael Smith and Gary Anderson. Littler plays down Klopp praise Latest darts results World champion Luke Humphries beat Mervyn King 10-4 and will face Masters winner Stephen Bunting, who won a final-leg decider against Peter Wright. Warrington-based Littler meets Australian Damon Heta in the quarter-finals, which will be followed by the semi-finals and final on Sunday. \"It would be unbelievable [to win the title], I have not even thought about it, I will just take it game by game,\" said Littler. He recovered from 5-3 down to overcome German Martin Schindler 10-8 in the last 32 of the event, which is often described as the 'FA Cup of darts'. \"I think if everyone didn't know, they are going to know now that I am not a morning person,\" said Littler. \"I did struggle this morning but I managed to get over the line against Martin. \"After that game, I chilled out, had some food, and I think played better in the evening, every player thinks they play better in the evening. \"I chilled myself out, went on my phone, went out for some food. This morning I didn't have breakfast and I was feeling sick because there was nothing in my stomach and my adrenaline was going.\" Smith was beaten 10-9 in the fifth round by Luke Woodhouse, while Anderson went out 10-5 at the next stage to Martin Lukeman. Littler began the year by becoming the youngest World Championship finalist, before falling to defeat against Luke Humphries. The teenager took his first PDC senior title by winning the Bahrain Masters and is second in the Premier League behind Dutchman Van Gerwen.

Humphries won a thrilling contest 6-5, surviving a final-leg match dart and prevailing with a fine 11-dart break. It is Humphries' first victory over Littler in eight matches since January's World Championship final. \"That record wasn't something that was playing on my mind,\" said Humphries. \"Luke is a fantastic player and in elite level sport, these runs of results can happen, but of course I'm relieved that run is over.\" Humphries, who averaged 101 and notched five 180s to complete his comeback, will face Stephen Bunting on Sunday after he beat Ryan Searle 6-5. Bunting survived five match darts of his own in the afternoon session, setting up the tie with Humphries in dramatic fashion. Meanwhile, Rob Cross remained on course to defend his 2023 title with a 6-5 victory over Martin Schindler. He will face Danny Noppert, who beat Daryl Gurney by the same scoreline earlier in the day. Gerwyn Price comfortably beat Brendan Dolan 6-1 to set up a tie with Gary Anderson, who defeated Christian Perez 6-3. And world number two Michael van Gerwen breezed past Johan Engstrom 6-1 to set up a match with Jonny Clayton, who edged out Chris Dobey 6-5. Elsewhere, Doncaster's Beau Greaves claimed her first PDC Women's Series title of 2024 with a dominant 5-1 victory over Lisa Ashton in Wigan. Two-time reigning women's world champion Greaves, who reeled off five straight legs after Ashton claimed the opener, said she was \"relieved to get the win over the line\" after some \"up and down\" form this season. It was the second of two PDC Women's Series events held in Wigan on Saturday. In the first, the Netherlands' Noa-Lynn van Leuven fought back from 4-0 down to beat Greaves and claim her second title of the campaign."

Michael van Gerwen's lead in the table was reduced to six points following his quarter-final loss to Humphries. Van Gerwen was bidding for a fourth successive night win after triumphs in Berlin, Glasgow and Newcastle, but was beaten 6-3 in the opening quarter-final. Aspinall failed to win a match in the first three weeks of the competition, but two final appearances in a row have catapulted him into the top four. He told Sky Sports: \"I'm just very happy. In the past two weeks, I've really dug deep. \"Everyone knows I'm a fighter. I've been down for the first three weeks, but a final and a win in the past two weeks - I'm over the moon.\" Premier League - night five as it happened Cross had looked in imperious form in a 6-1 quarter-final success against Gerwyn Price and he followed that by beating teenager Luke Littler 6-3 in his semi-final.  But he started slowly in the final, losing the first five legs, with Aspinall landing a 160 checkout to move within one leg of victory. Former world champion Cross added some respectability to the score, but Aspinall eventually closed out a comfortable win.

But Littler, who beat James Wade to reach the last 32 of the UK Open on Friday, is not getting carried away. \"I gave it a like and went on to the next video,\" he said. \"That was literally another day in my life.\" Littler, who is a fan of Liverpool's bitter rivals Manchester United, added: \"I actually watched the final and the young lads are doing well, but if he wants to compare them to me then he can.\" Littler averaged nearly 102 and had four 100-plus finishes as he overcame Wade 10-7 to reach the fifth round. The teenager is now the favourite for the tournament after the opening night saw Michael van Gerwen slip to a surprise defeat by Austria's Mensur Suljovic. Dutchman Van Gerwen, a three-time winner of the competition, appeared to be struggling with an elbow injury as he was beaten 10-7. Asked about his chances of lifting a first major title since joining the main PDC Tour at the start of the year, Littler said: \"I have not even thought about it, but I know if my game is there every match then I don't see why I can't win it. \"I don't mind who I play. It is what I dreamed of, playing in front of thousands every week, I just take it in my stride.\" Other winners on the opening night included world champion Luke Humphries, who beat Dirk van Duijvenbode of the Netherlands 10-7, while defending champion Andrew Gilding defeated fellow Englishman Josh Payne 10-7 and Masters winner Stephen Bunting overcame Danny Lauby 10-3 Nathan Aspinall, who won night five of the Premier League Darts in Exeter on Thursday, is also through to the next round after beating Scott Mitchell 10-6. World number five Gerwyn Price is out after a 10-9 defeat to Martin Schindler of Germany, which saw the Welshman miss six darts in a thrilling deciding leg. Schindler's reward for beating Price is a fifth-round match with teenager Littler. Van Gerwen's conqueror Suljovic will play Dave Chisnall, while world number one Humphries has been drawn to play Benjamin Reus of Denmark. Day one of three-day event saw all 158 players in action, with the first four rounds played across eight stages. The world's top 32 players entered at the fourth-round stage on Friday evening."

Seven-time champion Van Gerwen now has an eight-point lead at the top of the table after wins in Berlin and Glasgow.  He beat Gerwyn Price in the quarter-finals before getting the better of Luke Littler in a last-leg decider.  Aspinall came into the night without a match win in this year's Premier League but beat Michael Smith and Rob Cross. Van Gerwen told Sky Sports: \"I love those gold trophies! It's good to win like I did. \"People think it's easy but it's not easy. All the pressure, you have to deal with it all the time. \"I'm not going to give myself any targets. I'm going week by week, no targets, no goals, just keep focussing otherwise I get bored. \"I don't know how many nights I can win, I don't want to give myself a target but it could be a record [number of weekly wins] this year.\" Premier League of Darts - night four as it happened Littler downplays comparisons to Taylor Defending champion Van Gerwen was below par despite his win in Glasgow last week but he was close to his scintillating best on Thursday evening. He averaged 107.27 against Price and secured a 6-4 victory despite only taking six of his 18 doubles. His semi-final with Littler was the fourth time the pair have met since the English teenager's rise to prominence, and the Dutchman has now won three of those matches.  He missed six match darts, allowing Littler to force a decider, but broke the 17-year-old to progress to the final.  Van Gerwen then had to recover from an early break by Aspinall but won five legs on the spin to open up a commanding lead.  Aspinall, the Premier League runner-up in 2020, took out 170 to get the game back on throw but Van Gerwen broke again to seal the win.  Aspinall's two match victories leaves Scotland's Peter Wright as the only player yet to register a win this season, although he was much improved in his 6-5 defeat by Littler, who also had a 170 finish. Wright averaged 103.37 but missed match darts to claim that elusive win.  Night five of the Premier League will take place in Exeter on Thursday, 29 February.

        "text": " Three-time Olympic gold medallist Max Whitlock will retire after the Paris 2024 Games. The 31-year-old, who has won 32 major international medals, is Britain's most successful gymnast.  He will become the first gymnast to win four Olympic medals on the same apparatus if he adds to his two golds and a bronze on the pommel horse this summer. \"This decision now feels right,\" Whitlock told BBC Breakfast. \"Going for my final Olympic Games, it feels very, very strange talking about it and it's almost hard to articulate what it's like. \"It's a really nice mindset to be in, to think I'll just give it all I've got.\" Whitlock's Olympic journey started at London 2012, where he claimed bronze in the pommel horse and helped Great Britain finish third in the team event. At Rio 2016 he won bronze for Britain's first medal in the all-around event for 108 years, and became the nation's first individual Olympic gold medallist in artistic gymnastics with victory in the floor and pommel horse events. After retaining his pommel horse title at the Tokyo Olympics in 2021, Whitlock took an 18-month break from the sport to deal with mental health struggles. His other honours include three World Championship golds, four European Championship titles and four Commonwealth Games golds. \"Ever since Rio where I was at my peak age, I think I've had questions thrown at me about when am I retiring,\" Whitlock said. \"I've wanted to prove people wrong a lot of the way through my journey and I've always had the mindset of trying to do this for as long as I possibly can.\" Whitlock, who is from Hertfordshire, says his motivation for Paris 2024 comes from wanting his five-year-old daughter Willow to watch him compete at an Olympics. After no international fans were allowed in Tokyo in 2021 because of the Covid-19 pandemic, Whitlock is looking forward to seeing Willow in the crowd. \"Now I've given myself the opportunity for Willow to come and watch an Olympic Games because she couldn't in Tokyo. That's such a good feeling for me,\" he said. \"When I'm in arenas competing, Willow waits for it to go quiet and she calls for me and we do this double thumbs-up, I think I'd love to do that in the Paris Olympics.\" This year's Olympics take place between 26 July and 11 August. Whitlock will be in action at the European Championships in Italy at the end of April before the British Olympic gymnastics squad is announced in June.

        "text": " Britain's five-time Commonwealth Games champion Claudia Fragapane has retired from gymnastics aged 26. \"It feels like the right time,\" she told British Gymnastics. Fragapane won four gold medals at the 2014 Commonwealth Games in Glasgow and was named BBC Young Sports Personality of the Year that same year. A two-time world bronze medallist, she added a fifth Commonwealth gold to her collection with victory in the team event in Birmingham in 2022. Fragapane added: \"I'm really happy with my career. Gymnastics has been my whole life for as long as I remember, but now I'm ready to flick over a new chapter.\" She won team bronze at the 2015 World Championships and floor bronze two years later in Montreal. Fragapane didn't reach any individual finals at the 2016 Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, but helped Team GB finish fifth in the team final. \"I started gymnastics at six, and from my first session at Bristol Hawks I said, 'I want to go to the Olympics',\" she said. \"I don't think I knew how hard that would be at the time. \"Once my heart is set on something, I do everything I can to get there, and I think that's why I know that now is the right time to hang up my leotard from elite gymnastics.\" Bristol-born Fragapane says she will continue to work in gymnastics as a coach and run choreography workshops. \"I want to empower gymnasts to handle their nerves and perform with confidence - that's going to be my next focus,\" she said. \"I'm excited to continue working in the sport that has made me who I am.\" British Gymnastics said: \"We'd like to congratulate Claudia on an outstanding gymnastics career and thank her for the incredible legacy she leaves behind.\""

        "text": " American Simone Biles said she felt like a failure following a disappointing 2020 Tokyo Olympics. Biles was aiming for six gold medals at the Games, which took place in 2021 because of the coronavirus pandemic. Instead, the 26-year-old won a silver and bronze as she suffered with the 'twisties', which gymnasts describe as a kind of mental block, in Japan. \"I wish I could sit here and tell you it was glorious,\" Biles told Vanity Fair magazine., external \"When I took a break after 2016 [Rio Olympics], I had the time of my life. I was doing anything and everything. \"But after 2020, it was kind of depressing until I started therapy and got help. \"I felt like a failure.\" Biles won four gold medals at the Games in Rio as she won the all-round, vault, floor and team events. In Tokyo, she won a silver in the team event and bronze in the beam but pulled out of four events to prioritise her mental health as she struggled with the 'twisties'. \"Even though I was empowering so many people and speaking out about mental health, every time I talked about my experience in Tokyo - because it obviously didn't go the way that I had planned - it stung a little bit. But all in all, it was the best decision,\" added Biles. She returned to gymnastics following a two-year break when she won the all-round title at the US Classic. Biles went on to win four gold medals at the World Championships in Belgium in 2023 and, in winning her second, became the most decorated gymnast in history with a total of 34 world and Olympic medals. On making the Olympics in Paris this year, she said: \"If I don't make it to Paris, it won't absolutely crush me.\""

        "text": " Rhys McClenaghan warmed up for the European Championships next week by claiming a bronze medal in the pommel horse final at the Apparatus World Cup in Doha. The double world champion has been working on a new routine with the Paris Olympics in mind so a score of 15.233 is a step in the right direction. In his only other World Cup appearance of the season in Baku in March, the Ards gymnast failed to make the final. However the high standard of the podium finishers is a reminder that McClenaghan will have to be at his very best to add an Olympic title to his World, European and Commonwealth titles this summer. The gold went to Ahmad Abu Al Soud from Jordan with a score of 15.500 just ahead of Tokyo Olympic silver medallist Chih Kai Lee of Taipei who managed an impressive 15.400. Al Soud won silver behind McClenaghan at the 2022 World Championships in Liverpool and bronze behind the Irish competitor at the following year's Worlds in Antwerp. McClenaghan heads to Rimini where he will look to defend the European championship and if he succeeds it would be his third continental title. One gymnast he will not face will be double Olympic pommel horse champion Max Whitlock who has been forced to pull out because of a wrist injury. With no other competitions scheduled it now looks like McClenaghan and Whitlock will not face each other until Paris but as the World Cup circuit has proved there are others who fancy their chances of Olympic glory.

        "text": " Max Whitlock says \"it feels good to be back\" after winning pommel horse gold at the British Championships.  The three-time Olympic champion stepped up preparations as he aims to defend his pommel title in Paris this summer.  Whitlock, 31, took a year out after the Tokyo Olympics and returned to finish fifth at the 2023 World Championships in his favoured discipline.  \"It feels crazy we are in Olympic year now - it feels like 2024 has really started,\" he said in Liverpool. \"It feels good, it feels good to be back. Since Tokyo it has been a bit of a rollercoaster for me, with a year out of the sport then coming back in.\" Next up is the European Championships in Rimini, Italy, at the end of April, before the British Olympic gymnastics squad is announced in June, a month before the start of the Paris Games. Watch Sunday's apparatus finals at the British Gymnastics Championships on BBC iPlayer Whitlock, who also won gold on the pommel horse and floor at the 2016 Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, produced an excellent pommel horse routine on Sunday to claim the British title - and went on to finish third in the horizontal bars and fourth in the parallel bars.  His pommel score of 15.250 was well ahead of British team-mate Jake Jarman, who was second with 14.150, while Joe Fraser, reigning Commonwealth Games champion on pommel horse, had to settle for bronze with 13.950.  Fraser, 25, won the men's all-around title on Saturday as he stepped up his comeback from injury and added gold in the parallel bars in Sunday's apparatus finals.  Jarman, 22, won his two specialist events - the floor and vault - and also the horizontal bars, while Harry Hepworth, 20, followed up recent good form on the World Cup circuit with gold in the men's rings, finishing ahead of Commonwealth Games champion Courtney Tulloch, who was second. Ondine Achampong stepped up her Olympic preparations with some stunning performances over the weekend in the women's competitions.  The 20-year-old, who helped Britain to team silver at the 2022 World Championships and European gold last year, won Saturday's all-around competition after defending champion Alice Kinsella pulled out with an arm injury. Achampong then added gold in the uneven bars, beam and floor in the individual apparatus finals to complete a clean sweep of victories across all the finals she competed in over the championships.   Shannon Archer, 25, won the women's vault - the only apparatus final for which Achampong did not qualify.

        "text": " Fifty-two years ago, Mary Peters returned to Belfast as an Olympic champion and it is 36 years since Stephen Martin and Jimmy Kirkwood stood on top of the podium along with their Great Britain hockey team-mates. Northern Ireland has always produced Olympic medallists from post-World War II boxers Freddie Gilroy, John Caldwell, Jim McCourt, John McNally and Hugh Russell as well as athlete Thelma Hopkins and hockey player Billy McConnell.  In the intervening years since 1988 and the success of Martin and Kirkwood, many have come close to winning gold with Wayne McCullough, Paddy Barnes, Michael Conlan, Jackie McWilliams, Wendy Houvenaghel, Alan Campbell, Richard Chambers, Peter Chambers and Aidan Walsh all claiming medals. This summer's Paris Olympics could be historic for Northern Ireland athletes competing for Team GB and Team Ireland with strong hopes that Lady Mary Peters and the two hockey players will be joined on NI's small list of Olympic champions. Where might that success come from? BBC Sport NI takes a look.  Rhys McClenaghan is now one of the most recognisable and successful Northern Ireland sports personalities of all time. Still only 24, he has a Commonwealth Games gold medal and two European titles under his belt and will arrive in Paris as the double world champion on the pommel horse.  But he wants that Olympic title, especially after the pain of Tokyo two years ago. At his best, few can match him. One of them happens to be the double Olympic champion, Max Whitlock from Great Britain, and the prospect of them duelling for gold is truly mouth-watering.  Six Northern Ireland rowers qualified their respective boats for Paris at last year's World Championships and barring any injuries, all six should be racing for medals in the summer. Hannah Scott won her first world title, leading the GB women's quad sculls to victory in Belgrade. The 24-year-old has the legacy of the Bann Rowing Club behind her and she was inspired by the medal success of the Chambers brothers and Alan Campbell at the London 2012 Olympics. After storming to success at the Worlds, the young, newly formed and motivated quartet should only get better and faster. Belfast's Rebecca Shorten is a world and European champion in the women's four. At the Tokyo Games in 2021, she narrowly missed out on a medal, finishing fourth.  Last year, with double Olympic champion Helen Glover joining the boat, results weren't as good as expected, but a bronze at the Worlds was still a worthy performance. Expect them to be better this year. A year ago, there were doubts if GB could field a women's eight. However, they put together a more than capable unit that included Aughnacloy's Rebecca Edwards that was good enough to win a World Cup gold medal and narrowly miss out on the podium at the Worlds. Another hard winter's training together and this boat could easily end up with an Olympic medal. If it's the women in the Team GB squad to watch out for, it's the men in Team Ireland. Banbridge's Philip Doyle has silver and bronze medals from the World Championships and would like nothing else than to bounce back from a disappointing performance in Tokyo when everything went wrong. Then there are the new boys on the lake, the Fermanagh duo of Nathan Timoney and Ross Corrigan who seized their opportunity last year by claiming a surprise bronze medal at the World Championships.  Timoney and Corrigan are not scared of reputations, although with the world watching, they will be exposed to an entirely different level of pressure.  Read more about Timoney and Corrigan's road to Paris Daniel Wiffen is fresh off an astonishing 2023, which he ended in style with an 800m freestyle world record at the European Short Course Championships in December.  Wiffen also secured 400m and 1500m Short Course titles after narrowly missing out on a medal at the World Championships in the summer despite smashing his own Irish records at 800m and 1500m time and time again. The county Armagh is facing up to a potentially massive 2024. In February, he will aim to become the first Irish swimmer to win a global medal before switching his focus to Paris.  As has often been the case through the years, Team Ireland's boxers will have high hopes of Olympic success. Having qualified for her second Olympics, a medal in Paris for Michaela Walsh would complete a truly great career and cement her legacy as Northern Ireland's most successful female boxer. Qualification isn't over yet, of course, but Jude Gallagher has hopes of joining Walsh on a Irish team that will be led by defending Olympic champion Kellie Harrington. Rather like his early views on the Ryder Cup, Rory McIlroy changed his opinion on the Olympics and hopes to add a gold medal to his four major titles after missing out on a medal in Tokyo.  Having helped Europe regain the Ryder Cup in 2023, winning the Masters and completing the career Grand Slam will top McIlroy's priorities this year. However, the Olympics are expected to feature in a busy summer for McIlroy with the US Open in June and the Open in July.  The Olympics golf tournament will also be played at Le Golf National, where McIlroy helped Europe win the 2018 Ryder Cup.  Like Daniel Wiffen, Ciara Mageean finished off 2023 in fine style, winning the BBC NI Sports Personality of the Year before setting a Park Run world record 24 hours later. Portaferry's Mageean has put together, at the age of 30, two of the greatest seasons ever by an Irish athlete back-to-back that included silver medals at the Commonwealth Games and European Championships, a fourth place at the World Championships and Irish records at 800m, 1000m, 1500m and the mile. The Olympics owes her after injury just prior to Tokyo saw her exit in the heats. Of all Northern Ireland's medal hopes, however, she arguably has the hardest task given the depth of talent in the women's 1500m.  That's not to say Mageean isn't up for the challenge. She most certainly is."

The 20-year-old trains in the Aylesbury Gymnastics Academy and won gold on the beam, uneven bars, floor and all around categories. \"It was all a shock,\" she told BBC South Today. \"Results give me confidence and after the British champs my confidence has gone up a lot more.\" The upcoming European Championships provide a final opportunity for Achampong to compete before the fast-approaching Paris Olympics this summer, and she wants to back up what she achieved last weekend. \"My targets are to carry on what I've been doing,\" she said. \"It would mean a lot to go to Europeans and come back with some medals, it would give me a lot of confidence for Paris.\" Achampong has previously won team gold for England at the 2022 Commonwealth Games and, individually, won silver medals in the all-around and floor exercise. She shares the gym with both Jessica and Jennifer Gadirova, who were part of a team to win bronze at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics.  The 20-year-old described her gym mates as an \"inspiration\" and her \"biggest cheerleaders\". As preparation for the upcoming games, Achampong has working on her mental strength as well as her physical attributes, putting her recent success down to a change in mindset. \"It's been a big thing for me,\" she added. \"Previously I've been on and off a bit mentally but I now have a mindset coach and she's really helped me turn my mental attitude into a strength.\" The European Championships take place in Rimini, Italy from 2-5 May."

You can watch the men's and women's apparatus finals live on Sunday on BBC iPlayer, Red Button and the BBC Sport website and app. The gymnasts will aim to underline why they should be in the team for Paris 2024 this summer before they also have another opportunity to shine at the European Championships in April and May. Great Britain have already secured their maximum quota spots - five each for men and women - for the Olympics but will only announce their squad in June. Here is what you need to know about this weekend's championships. Great Britain's men and women will compete for the all-around titles on Saturday before Sunday's apparatus finals.  While the start lists have yet to be published, three-time Olympic champion Whitlock and 2020 Olympic bronze medallist Kinsella will be among those in action. World champion Jake Jarman will be favourite for the vault title in Liverpool, while Joe Fraser, a former world champion on parallel bars and 2022 European all-around champion, is back after missing much of last year through injury. Also returning from injury is Giarnni Regini-Moran but fellow 2022 floor world champion Jessica Gadirova will be absent as she continues her recovery from an anterior cruciate ligament injury. In her absence, defending champion Kinsella and Ondine Achampong are likely to be the main contenders for the women's all-around title. Three-time European champion Becky Downie will also be hoping to stake her claim for a spot at Paris 2024, having missed out on selection for the 2020 Games. There will also be interest in 20-year-old Harry Hepworth, who won a superb World Cup floor gold in Germany last month by edging out Olympic champion Artem Dolgopyat. Watch the apparatus finals from 11:15 GMT on Sunday live on BBC iPlayer and the BBC Sport app and website. Men compete on six apparatus: vault, pommel horse, floor, high bar, rings and parallel bars, while women compete on four: uneven bars, vault, beam and floor."

        "text": " Great Britain gymnast Kelly Simm says she has no regrets after announcing her retirement from the sport. The 28-year-old from Fareham twice won gold for England in the team event at the Commonwealth Games and helped GB claim their first World Championship team medal in Glasgow in 2015. However after an injury-hit 2023 Simm has chosen to step away. \"I've had the most incredible career - it's just come to a natural end,\" she told BBC South Today. Simm took up the sport aged six and said: \"It's been a huge decision. You never really think it's going to come to an end, you think it's going to go on forever. \"But in the last year I have had another surgery. I have always wanted to do gymnastics to the best of my ability and its started to get to the point where I can't train the way I need to.  \"I just want to be able to compete to my best. You don't want to be out there if you're not and ultimately that was what led to it.\" While Simm said retirement was difficult to accept, she added: I don't regret anything, I am so proud of the journey and thankful for everyone who has been a part of it. \"To make a GB team at 16 - you train so much but never think you'll get there, so to make it was incredible. To go to three Commonwealth Games and to be part of the first team to win a World Championship medal was huge.\" Simm said she was disappointed not to have competed at an Olympics, having missed out on Rio 2016 and Tokyo 2020 and retiring less than six months before Paris 2024. \"The Olympics is one which will always sting a little bit, I was so close twice and had two major injuries at the wrong time. That was difficult,\" she said. \"Sometimes in elite sport all the stars have to align, you work hard but it's a little but of luck as well.\" Simm is starting the process of reinventing herself and admits the future is scary. \"Gymnastics is who I am. Everything about my life was gymnastics,\" she said. \"I've definitely felt a bit lost these past few months. I am continuing to find myself and learn, try and find new passions. You're starting again at the age of 28. It's a transition and I know I'll find things I enjoy.\" One of those passions is working to improve the sport for the next generation. The 2022 Whyte Review found \"systemic\" physical and emotional abuse in the sport \"borne of inadequate practice\". This included athletes having their bags searched for food in the \"tyranny\" of weight management. \"I was in GB squads for 12 years. I've seen it change a lot. You go into it and you don't know any different,\" she said. \"It's had a bit of a shake-up the past two years and that really opens your eyes to what was correct and what maybe could have been done a lot better.  \"It's brilliant to see it evolving. I am on some of the advisory boards trying to make a difference and improve the sport for future generations.\" Hear more from Kelly Simm on BBC South Today from 18:30 GMT on Tuesday."

However Adidas said its kits were \"embracing tradition\" and built \"around the classic British red, white and blue\". \"The pride and passion I feel when representing my country on the biggest sporting stage is second to none, so to unveil a kit that encompasses what this moment means is incredibly special,\" said Daley. \"I cannot wait to proudly wear it in Paris this summer, alongside my fellow team-mates.\" Paralympic athlete Olivia Breen added: \"It's always an exciting day when the ParalympicsGB kit is revealed for the first time - and this year is no different.  \"I love the new kit, it feels really fresh.\""

        "description": "\"I reckon there were a few people looking around thinking 'who is this guy?',\" Ben Pattison says.",
        "text": " \"I reckon there were a few people looking around thinking 'who is this guy?',\" Ben Pattison says. \"I feel like I did surprise quite a few people. Some of them had probably never even heard of me. Now I know they definitely have.\" It took less than 105 seconds for Pattison, Great Britain's last-minute 800m qualifier, to propel himself from relative unknown to Olympic medal threat. At least in the eyes of his competitors, anyway. Achieving World Championship bronze in August was a moment of wide-mouthed disbelief long in the making for the then 21-year-old, whose setbacks include a potentially life-threatening heart condition. Nicknamed 'Fireball' by team-mate Matthew Hudson-Smith, Paris 2024 has been the target since the red-headed Pattison defied the odds to go agonisingly close to Olympic qualification for Tokyo as a teenager. A hard-earned, guilt-free off-season in the United States aside, he could not have hoped to set himself up any better for an attempt at becoming Britain's first Olympic men's 800m medallist since Sebastian Coe 40 years ago. \"I still don't think the fact I'm a world medallist has fully sunk in and I don't think it will until I look back on my career,\" Pattison, 22, tells BBC Sport. \"It has given me a lot more confidence in training, and in life really. I can push myself a lot harder now knowing I am one of the best in the world.  \"I want to push on by matching or even topping that at the Olympics. There will be a target on my back, because people actually know who I am, but I'm looking forward to the challenge. I feel like I can beat anyone on my day.\" The journey to becoming the first British man to win a world 800m medal since Peter Elliott in Rome, 36 years earlier, has been far from smooth for the Loughborough business analytics graduate. Pattison feared none of this would be possible when he was told to stop running at the age of 18 after being diagnosed with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome, the condition which caused his heart to beat up to 250 beats per minute in training. Initially annoyed that his brand new heart-rate monitor must be faulty, and having informed doctors that stopping running was not an option, he had successful surgery during the pandemic - which involved burning away a part of his heart. \"I have been fine ever since the operation but it is something that can come back,\" says Pattison, who continues to have regular check-ups. \"I remember my first race after the operation, I was pretty emotional because I didn't know if I'd make it back from that. I didn't know of anyone having that operation and making it back to the top level before, so it was all new to me.  \"A year later I was in the European under-23 final and I came fourth, which I wasn't very happy with, but that was almost exactly a year on from when I had my operation and I remember thinking 'OK Ben, think of the bigger picture, you could not be running at all'.\" He has certainly made up for what he perceives as lost time, with a rapid rise to global prominence since. The whirlwind experience of the World Championships in Budapest, three years after his heart scare, came 12 months after he took Commonwealth Games bronze in Birmingham at his first major championships. He qualified for the Worlds at the very last opportunity, running a personal best one minute 44.02 seconds on home soil at the London Diamond League, and could barely sleep after reaching the final five weeks later. Fortunately, Pattison is at ease when things are moving fast. And the relaxed nature in which he discusses his ambitions for a potentially career-defining date with destiny in Paris suggests little will faze him as he transitions from going under the radar to main contender status. Having already achieved the Olympic qualifying standard, Pattison's immediate priority will be to make the top two at the British trials in June to secure his Team GB place. Yet to win a British title, he says that is motivation in itself. \"It's about putting three or four years of missing out and not making teams into one and hopefully coming out on top,\" says Pattison. \"To be on top of the Olympic podium is definitely a goal for the future and I can't see why I don't do it this year. \"If I do get a medal, hopefully my parents will be able to stay and watch the podium ceremony this time. They didn't realise the medal presentation was the next day in Budapest, so their flight home was the evening of the final and they unfortunately didn't get to see that.  \"Hopefully they are planning for that this year.\" ABBA's definitive story: How much do you really know about Sweden\u00e2\u0080\u0099s biggest musical export?

        "text": " With 100 days until the Paris 2024 Olympics begins, we've put together a guide to everything you need to know about the Games. Team GB finished fourth at the Tokyo Games with an impressive 64 medals, 22 of which were gold, just one down from their medal total from hosting London 2012. Tokyo 2020 was postponed by a year because of the Covid pandemic but now, three years later with the crowds back to fill the stands, what can we expect from Paris 2024? How is Paris preparing for the Olympics and Paralympics? Although the opening ceremony to signal the official start of the Paris 2024 Olympics will be held on Friday, 26 July, the sporting action actually begins on Wednesday, 24 July with pool matches in football, rugby sevens, handball and archery. The Games will run until 11 August. Most of the sporting events are in and around the heart of Paris, and the opening ceremony is set to be a spectacle, taking place along the Seine, the first time in Olympic history that the event will be held outside the main stadium. The Stade de France will host the athletics and the closing ceremony. The Parc des Princes, home to Paris St-Germain, will stage football matches, and Roland Garros will host tennis and boxing. Surfing will take place in Tahiti, an island in French Polynesia nearly 10,000 miles away from Paris. Some 95% of the venues already exist or are temporary, with the aquatics centre being the only new venue specifically built for the Games. The Paris Olympics will be shown live on BBC television and the BBC Sport website and app, and there will also be extensive coverage on BBC Radio 5 Live. The only sport making its debut in Paris is breaking. It was first introduced at the 2018 Youth Olympics and due to the combination of athleticism and urban dance, it has secured a spot on the programme. The competition will take place as solo battles and the breakers will improvise to the DJ's tracks, including moves such as windmills, the six step and freezes. Karate and baseball have been dropped from the Olympics since Tokyo 2020. There are 329 medal events across 32 sports. The first medal is set to be awarded in shooting on 27 July and the final medal event of Paris 2024 will be women's basketball on 11 August. Data experts Nielsen Gracenote's Virtual Medal Table forecast projects the United States to win the most medals overall at Paris 2024 (123). If Team USA meets this expectation, it would mark their eighth successive placement at the top of the final Summer Games medal table. Great Britain are set to finish third and beat their London 2012 medal haul with a predicted 66 medals, including 13 golds.  World Athletics has announced it will become the first international federation to award prize money at the Olympic Games. The global governing body said a total prize pot of $2.4m (\u00c2\u00a31.9m) has been made available for this summer's Olympics in Paris, with gold medallists receiving $50,000 (\u00c2\u00a339,400). World Athletics to award prize money at Olympics Russian and Belarusian athletes will be allowed to compete as neutral athletes. They will not take part in the opening ceremony at the 2024 Olympics in Paris, says the International Olympic Committee. Russia & Belarus athletes will not be part of opening ceremony Around 350 athletes are expected to compete for Team GB, with athletes already confirmed in swimming, canoe slalom, sailing and triathlon.

        "text": " Twenty-three Chinese swimmers tested positive for a banned drug before the Tokyo Olympics in 2021 but were cleared to compete after the country's anti-doping agency found the results were caused by contamination. The swimmers all tested positive for heart medication trimetazidine (TMZ) at a training camp seven months before the delayed Games. China Anti-Doping Agency (Chinada) determined they had unintentionally ingested the substance and would not face any punishment. The country's 30-member swimming team won six medals at the Tokyo Olympics, including three golds. Details of the case were revealed by the New York Times,, external who shared reporting with German broadcaster ARD. United States Anti-Doping Agency (Usada) chief executive Travis Tygart said it was \"crushing\" to hear of the positive tests before an Olympic Games. He said the World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada) and Chinada had \"swept these positives under the carpet by failing to fairly and evenly follow the global rules that apply to everyone else in the world\", while athletes \"impacted by this potential cover-up\" had been \"deeply and painfully betrayed by the system\". \"All of those with dirty hands in burying positive tests and suppressing the voices of courageous whistleblowers must be held accountable to the fullest extent of the rules and law,\" Tygart added. Britain's Olympic swimming champion Adam Peaty questioned why the information was not released earlier, adding: \"So disappointing from Wada.\" In response to Tygart's statement, Wada said it was \"astonished by the outrageous, completely false and defamatory remarks\" and his \"very serious accusations against Wada\", adding that it had referred his comments to its lawyers. \"Mr Tygart's allegations are politically motivated,\" Wada added, and \"the damaging comments have been delivered without any supporting evidence whatsoever\". Tygart has since accused Wada of \"threats and scare tactics\". Wada earlier confirmed to BBC Sport it was notified of Chinada's decision in June 2021. The world body said it \"carefully reviewed\" the case and consulted independent experts to \"test the contamination theory\" as well as external legal counsel. Wada concluded it was \"not in a position to disprove the possibility that contamination was the source of TMZ\", the athletes bore \"no fault\" and an appeal against Chinada's decision was \"not warranted\". Olivier Rabin, Wada's senior director of science and medicine, added: \"The contamination scenario was further supported by the combination of the consistently low concentrations of TMZ as well as no doping pattern with several athletes presenting multiple samples collected over the course of several days which fluctuated between negative and positive [and vice versa].\" Russian figure skater Kamila Valieva was ultimately given a four-year ban for doping after testing positive for TMZ in December 2021, shortly before competing in the 2022 Winter Olympics. Chinese Olympic swimming champion Sun Yang served a three-month ban in 2014 after testing positive for TMZ. He is currently serving a separate doping ban, which was reduced from eight years to four years and three months in June 2021. Swimming's governing body World Aquatics, then known as Fina, was also notified about the adverse analytical findings (AAFs) in 2021. World Aquatics said it was \"carefully considered\" by Fina's doping control review board. It added: \"World Aquatics is confident that these AAFs were handled diligently and professionally, and in accordance with all applicable anti-doping regulations, including the World Anti-Doping Code.\" Chinada told the New York Times it found the swimmers had not broken anti-doping rules and was not obliged to publish details about the case without their consent. Wada shared its conclusions with the International Testing Agency (ITA), which in 2022 raised issues regarding TMZ samples possibly being misreported. Usada contacted Wada in April 2023 saying it had received a tip that positive TMZ cases had been hidden. Wada said its intelligence and investigations department \"concluded that proper procedures had been followed and that there was no evidence of wrongdoing\". Gunter Younger, Wada's director of intelligence and investigations, added: \"The data held by us clearly showed that there had been no attempt to hide the positive tests as they had been reported in the usual way by the Chinese authorities.\" The ITA said it received \"confidential and anonymous information\" in summer 2021 about the positive tests. It added: \"In parallel to a full assessment of the information received that remains active, the ITA conducted many targeted follow-up testing missions in 2021, 2022, 2023 and up until today.\""

        "text": " Kenya's Eliud Kipchoge is confident he can win a historic third successive Olympic marathon gold medal in Paris this year. The 39-year-old, who was victorious in Rio de Janeiro in 2016 and at the delayed Tokyo Games in 2021, finished 10th in this year's Tokyo Marathon in March.  Ethiopia's Abebe Bikila (1964) and East Germany's Waldemar Cierpinski (1980) are the only other men to defend an Olympic marathon title. \"My huge expectation actually is to win the Olympics for the third time,\" said Kipchoge. Last week Kipchoge was named alongside two-time Boston Marathon champion Benson Kipruto, Timothy Kiplagat, Vincent Kipkemoi Ngetich and newcomer Alexander Mutiso on Kenya's marathon shortlist for the Paris Games, which begin on 26 July and end on 11 August. Kipruto won this year's Tokyo Marathon in a time of two hours, two minutes and 16 seconds, with Kiplagat and Ngetich completing the podium. Kipchoge finished over four and a half minutes adrift of Kipruto in Japan, but that result has not made him concerned about his chances in Paris on 10 August. \"I think I just got tired,\" he explained. \"I don't know what happened but it's life, it's sport. It's the beauty of sport.\" Kipchoge will turn 40 in November and he would not be drawn when asked if he could race at the 2028 Olympics in Los Angeles. \"In Kenya we say you don't chase two rabbits at a time, you will miss all of them. You chase one,\" he said. \"So the rabbit of the Olympic Games is what I'm chasing now. After that I go back to the drawing board, see what's in my bucket list and start again to chase the next.\" In the meantime, as questions persist over when he plans to retire, he has reiterated his commitment to inspire people of all levels to be active. \"If you can convince me that the moment I will be crossing the finishing line the whole world has become a running world then I will retire,\" he added. Kipchoge was in the French capital on Thursday as part of Kenya's kit launch for the Games, and he will also receive a financial reward should he defend his marathon title. In a first for the Olympics, World Athletics president Lord Coe has announced that all athletics gold medallists in Paris will earn $50,000 (\u00c2\u00a340,100) in prize money. Kipchoge believes the development will boost the sport in the long term. \"I don't run because of money but I run because I want to perform,\" Kipchoge said. \"It was a great idea for Seb Coe and World Athletics. For the young generations I think it's a good idea to develop - it makes sport more interesting.\""

Estanguet added he was \"very satisfied with where we stand at this moment\".  He told BBC Sport: \"My message is you can have confidence with this event.\" Amid mounting concerns over safety, Estanguet said \"I would like to reassure that it's non-negotiable. Security is the priority.\" \"It's the biggest event that France has ever organised, and we want to showcase the best of France. So definitely we are determined to be ready.  \"We are looking forward to welcoming the world in Paris.\" \"When I discussed this with [London 2012 chief] Seb Coe, he told me\u00e2\u0080\u00a6in the last 100 days, there will be more criticism, more people worried. It's exactly what is happening. My role is to remain calm, remain focused on what is very important to deliver.  \"The venues are ready, the budget is balanced. We have very good ticket sales, the level of ambition is very high.\"  All you need to know for Paris 2024 How is Paris preparing for the Olympics and Paralympics? Watch: Cloudy skies stop sun sparking Olympic torch journey The opening ceremony is set to be the first to be held outside a stadium, with more than 10,000 athletes expected to sail along a 6km stretch of the Seine on 160 barges. However, this week the French President Emmanuel Macron said it could be relocated to either the Trocadero square or the Stade de France if the security risk is deemed too high. There are concerns that wars in Ukraine and Gaza could increase the threat.  \"I trust in the system in place to secure this opening ceremony\" said Estanguet, the president of the organising committee.  \"It's the first time ever the objective is to have the maximum of people enjoying this moment. It's five times more than what happened in a stadium before\u00e2\u0080\u00a6So it's a great opportunity.\" Organisers had originally planned to accommodate some 600,000 people to watch the ceremony from riverbanks, but that has now been scaled down to 300,000. Tourists will not be given free access to watch the ceremony, as was originally planned. Instead, tickets will be by invitation only, not via open registration. France raised its security threat level in October, when a teacher was killed in a knife attack in a school in Arras. In December, a German man died and two others were injured in a knife and hammer attack on a street in central Paris. European security officials have warned of a growing risk of attacks by Islamist militants amid the Israel-Gaza war. Concerns have also been heightened following the threats by the Islamic State group (IS) to Champions League quarter-final football matches including in Paris. Last week, a post was shared by Al-Azaim Foundation, a media channel responsible for spreading messages from the IS-K branch of the Islamist militant group. IS-K also claimed responsibility for the  deadly attack on Crocus City Hall in Moscow last month. \"We should not be too naive\" said Estanguet.  \"We know that people would try to benefit from this international media exposure. But again, it's up to us to remain calm to and to promote and defend what is most important in this event. And for me, it's sport. \"We are working also with different countries around the world to make sure it will be a safe place during the games. And there is strong co-operation. So, we can be confident.\""

        "text": " A group of international sports federations say World Athletics' decision to award prize money at the Paris Olympics \"undermines the values of Olympism and the uniqueness of the Games\". Last week World Athletics announced it will become the first federation to offer prize money at an Olympics this summer. Gold medallists in athletics events will earn $50,000 (\u00c2\u00a339,400). In a statement, the Association of Summer Olympic International Federations (ASOIF), said it was \"neither informed nor consulted\", despite World Athletics being one of its members. It said that the federations it represents have \"expressed several concerns\". \"One cannot and should not put a price on an Olympic gold medal,\" it said. \"Not all sports could or should replicate this move, even if they wanted to. Paying prize money in a multi-sport environment goes against the principle of solidarity, reinforces a different set of values across the sports and opens up many questions.\" It added that \"there has been consensus that Olympic revenues should, at least for the more commercially successful and financially independent international federations, be invested as a priority into development and integrity matters\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 it appears that World Athletics' latest initiative opens rather than solves a number of complex issues. \"ASOIF will raise these concerns with World Athletics and will continue to promote dialogue amongst its members and the IOC.\" Given the Olympics' origins as an amateur sports event, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) does not award prize money but distributes funding through international federations, and national Olympic committees. World Athletics' move, which will be extended to silver and bronze medallists for the 2028 Games, was widely praised by former athletes when it was announced by its president Lord Coe. In response to ASOIF's statement, World Athletics said: \"Awarding this prize money to gold medallists in Paris 2024, and then extending it to all medallists in LA 2028, is about underscoring our unwavering commitment to empowering the athletes and recognising the critical role they play in the success of an Olympic Games. \"It is impossible to put a marketable value on winning an Olympic medal. But we think it is important to make sure some of the revenues generated by our athletes at the Olympic Games are directly returned to those who make the Games the global spectacle that it is. \"This is the continuation of a journey World Athletics started back in 2015, which sees all the money received every four years from the IOC's revenue share allocation (approximately $40m) go directly back into our sport.\" It added \"80% of all World Athletics' income goes directly back into the sport\". Earlier this week, David Lappartient, the head of cycling's governing body the UCI, said World Athletics' decision went against the Olympic spirit. Andy Anson, the head of the British Olympic Association (BOA), was also critical, saying he did not think it was \"particularly appropriate or helpful\", and risked creating a two-tier Olympics.  Some national Olympic committees offer financial rewards to their medallists, though the BOA does not. Prize money at Games \"against Olympic spirit\""

        "text": " The 2024 Olympic Games in Paris are 100 days away, but staging the world's biggest sporting event is a privilege Africa has never been afforded. That could be set to change, with Egypt preparing to table a proposal to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) for the 2036 Games. With construction on potential venues well under way - and some already completed - one Egyptian official has declared it is \"time for Africa\". \"We can't claim the IOC and the Olympic Games to be universal without hosting a Games on the African continent,\" Dr Kamilla Swart-Arries, an expert in sport, tourism, and events management, told BBC Sport Africa. But what would it take for the continent to host the Olympics for the first time? Africa has previously put on large sporting events, including the 1995 Rugby World Cup and 2010 Fifa World Cup in South Africa, while Morocco will co-host football's biggest tournament in 2030. Dakar in Senegal is preparing for the 2026 Youth Olympic Games, but the sheer scale and cost of hosting the Olympics presents the main challenge for any African bid to overcome. There will be 10,500 athletes competing in 329 events in Paris, with the Paralympics in August and September featuring 4,400 athletes in 549 events. Around 15 million tourists are expected to visit the French capital. How is France preparing for the Olympics and Paralympics? Everything you need to know about the Paris Olympics According to Sharif El Erian, the secretary general of Egypt's National Olympic Committee (NOC), there are \"very few countries in Africa\" which have the capability to host the Games. \"They were totally right not to come to Africa before,\" he told BBC Sport Africa. \"If you want me to pick three countries who are the best when it comes to facilities in Africa, I can pick easily: Egypt, South Africa and Morocco. The rest have no chance.\" Some facilities earmarked by Egypt for 2036, including a 90,000-seater stadium, are already in use at its yet-to-be-named New Administrative Capital, located some 40km east of Cairo. \"I think Egypt is ready now,\" El Erian added. \"The main support infrastructure - roads, security, airports and hotels - has been developed in the past seven or eight years very strongly.\" Egypt's NOC gained approval to bid from President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi back in September 2022 so, in short, the North African country needs to convince the IOC's executive board. Yet, amid competition, it may not prove straightforward. \"It's a dialogue process. The process for bidding has changed a lot,\" Dr Swart-Arries, an associate professor at the Hamad Bin Khalifa University in Qatar, added. IOC president Thomas Bach visited the New Administrative Capital in 2022 and toured the 92-acre sports complex that will be named the Olympic City. \"He saw for himself that we are very capable,\" El Erian said. A statement issued by the Egyptian cabinet, external said that Bach had \"asserted that Egypt's sporting infrastructure gives it an opportunity to host the 2036 Olympic Games\". \"The good thing is the whole continent is behind us through Anoca (the Association of National Olympic Committees of Africa),\" El Erian added. \"I hope that we are a strong contender. It will benefit the ideas and the legacy of the IOC.\" No official bids have been submitted for the 2036 Games, but several countries are already vying for position. India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi says his country \"will leave no stone unturned\" in efforts to secure the showpiece while Mexico and Indonesia have expressed interest in hosting. Turkey is also expected to bid again after several failed attempts by Istanbul, including to Tokyo for 2020. Another option in the long term could be a regional African bid. \"We've seen it more with the Fifa World Cup than in an Olympic Games but, potentially, maybe we should open ourselves up to that kind of thinking,\" Dr Swart-Arries said. \"Even if we look at Paris 2024, the surfing is in Tahiti. It's not out of the ordinary to consider a regional Games in the future.\" The Egyptians have previously mounted three unsuccessful Olympic bids. Alexandria missed out to Berlin for both the 1916 event (which was ultimately cancelled) and in 1936, while Cairo failed to make the IOC's shortlist for the 2008 hosts.  South Africa has come closest to bringing the showpiece to the continent, when Cape Town was eliminated in the penultimate round of voting for the 2004 Games, which ended up in Athens. Dr Swart-Arries worked on that bid and points to several reasons for its failure. \"A large part of it was in relation to geopolitics,\" she explained. \"At the time we were bidding it was 1995 to 1997, just post-apartheid. We were probably not ready from the perspective of Olympic sports. \"Also during that period, in terms of the bidding process itself, we know that the Olympic Games was fraught with corruption.\", external Hosting large sporting events brings scrutiny on human rights, which were under the microscope when Qatar hosted the 2022 World Cup. Human Rights Watch has highlighted \"nationwide repression\" since Egyptian President Sisi came to power in 2014 following a coup which overthrew the Muslim Brotherhood's Mohammed Morsi. Whether that has an impact on an Egyptian bid remains to be seen - but controversy is never far away when the Olympics are concerned. Muslim athletes from France are not expected to wear the hijab at the 2024 Games, adhering to the country's ban on women wearing headscarves. But the IOC has made it clear that its rules, with no restrictions on religious or cultural attire, will apply in the Olympic Village. \"For me, living in Qatar and also coming from South Africa, it's quite frustrating to see how these bids are questioned - particularly in the western media,\" Dr Swart-Arries said. \"In Paris, women are challenged by the current regulations. Every Olympics needs to question human rights. \"After Paris it is Los Angeles 2028. Why not look at the whole issue of gun violence in the United States as an example of where changes needed to be made? \"Any Games can be used to enhance and improve human rights or make significant positive contributions.\" Despite the cost of staging the Olympics, the prestige and subsequent attention - including a TV audience measured in the billions - is usually worth it. \"I think it (an Egyptian Games) will be profitable, because the main profit of any Olympic Games is the broadcasting,\" El Erian said. Sam Ramsamy, once president of South Africa's NOC and a former IOC member, says it is \"high time\" the Olympics comes to Africa and there would be benefits \"right across the board\". \"It encompasses economics, human rights, development in all aspects, and climate change, which is very important at this particular stage,\" he told BBC Sport Africa. \"Not too long ago, Cairo held the COP programme on the environment. \"Most importantly, it will inspire all of Africa. It [will show] that Africa is not just a sleeping giant, it is a giant that is awake.\""

        "text": " Sign up for notifications to Insight features via the BBC Sport app and read the latest in the series here. Resting next to the Seine river, the Cite du Cinema is best known for film-making. By July, though, its cavernous studio spaces will be refashioned into the heart of the athletes' village for the Paris Olympics. Athletes from all countries and cultures will be found at the dining hall sitting across from one another sharing meals and stories. It is a multi-cultural melting pot, in which people of all different creeds and colours meet every four years. Yet the dress code for the hosts is different from their guests. In September the International Olympic Committee (IOC) made clear that athletes in Paris can represent themselves and their faith, as well as their country. \"For the Olympic Village, the IOC rules apply,\" an IOC spokesperson told Reuters.  \"There are no restrictions on wearing the hijab or any other religious or cultural attire.\" The French team, though, have been told something different. \"The ban on the hijab [a type of headscarf that covers the head and neck, but leaves the face clear] is the consequence of two discriminations: it is islamophobia, but also gender discrimination,\" says Veronica Noseda, who plays football for Les Degommeuses, a Parisian football club set up to fight discrimination. Assile Toufaily, who moved to Lyon in 2021 having played football at international level for her native Lebanon, agrees. \"It's not really about the French society, it's the government,\" she says. \"There is a hate on Muslim people during these last few years in France and it's shown in sport.\" This summer and the arrival of the Olympics in Paris will be the clearest sporting demonstration of a distinctive and divisive French concept. Liberte, egalite, fraternite, which first appeared during the French Revolution, may be the most famous expression of what France aspires to. It appears at the front of the constitution, on coins, on stamps and on public buildings. Less famous, and harder to translate, is another key tenet of the French republic: laicite.  Most often translated as secularism in English, laicite does not stipulate that France's people should drop any religious customs or symbols, but, instead, that state and public institutions should be expressly free of them. It is an idea that is keenly contested in France, particularly in the wake of a raft of terrorist attacks over the past decade and a parallel resurgence in far-right politics. French President Emmanuel Macron has found himself defining the term again and again. \"The problem isn't laicite,\" he said in a speech in October 2020. \"Laicite in the French Republic means the freedom to believe or not believe, the possibility of practising one's religion as long as law and order is ensured.  \"Laicite means the neutrality of the state. In no way does it mean the removal of religion from society and the public arena. A united France is cemented by laicite.\" A 2004 law attempted to add some clarity to the concept, banning \"ostentatious\" religious symbols from state schools, without naming specific examples. While Sikh turbans, Jewish kippah and large Christian crucifixes have been interpreted as falling the wrong side of laicite, most of the debate has focused around head coverings among the largest Muslim population of any nation in Western Europe. In September, French sports minister Amelie Oudea-Castera - a former professional tennis player who lost to Martina Hingis in the Wimbledon juniors semi-final in 1994 - confirmed that the French Olympic team, as an institution representing and funded by the French public, is bound by laicite. \"It means absolute neutrality in public services,\" she said. \"The France team will not wear the headscarf.\" Athletes from other nations will be free wear religious symbols in the Paris 2024 athletes' village as they wish. However members of the French team, if they are to abide by their nation's rules, can't. The stance has been criticised by some international bodies. \"No-one should impose on a woman what she needs to wear or not wear,\" said a spokesperson for the United Nations Human Rights Office., external \"Prohibitions on the wearing of religious headscarves in public spaces violate Muslim women's rights,\" added human rights charity Amnesty International. In France however, the ban carries considerable support. \"It is a complicated and very, very sensitive issue,\" says Sebastien Maillard, an associate fellow at think tank Chatham House who has reported on French politics and society during his career. \"When I moved from Paris to London, that was one of the main differences. In the United Kingdom religion is displayed quite comfortably, whereas in Paris it is often seen as something more provocative.\" Maillard points to another, smaller, controversy involving Paris 2024's exclusion of religious symbols. In March the Game's official poster - a stylised image of Paris' landmarks coming together to form a stadium - was unveiled. The artist omitted the golden crucifix that stands on top of the Hotel des Invalides, sparking discussion as to how strictly the Games - which will the cost French taxpayers several billion euros - stick to the principles of laicite. \"The debate today more often focuses around a Muslim community, one that wants to be fully part of French society but also follow religion in its own way,\" says Maillard. \"We have this debate over and over about how that fits. \"The French republic was partly founded on a rejection of Catholicism and it feels threatened whenever religion impinges on it. There is a strong fear, particularly among older generations, of religion exerting influence over society and the state.\" The debate plays out in areas where those demographic differences are most pronounced - in education, but also sport. During last year's period of Ramadan - a month-long fast observed between sunrise and sunset by Muslims - the French Football Federation (FFF) sent out an edict to referees not to pause matches to allow players to break their fast, saying these interruptions \"do not respect the provisions of the statutes of the FFF\". This year, with Ramadan coinciding with an international break, the FFF confirmed that it would not alter the timing of meals and practices to accommodate Muslim players, effectively preventing them from fasting while in camp with France's age-grade and senior teams. Lyon midfielder Mahamadou Diawara left France Under-19s' get-together, reportedly because of the restrictions., external Another talented prospect in another sport, basketball player Diaba Konate, who has represented France at under-23 level, has left for the United States, saying the ban on her wearing the hijab has left her \"heartbroken\"., external Even in low-level local matches, female Muslim players are usually banned from wearing a headscarf, on the basis that the leagues are organised and run by public bodies. Protective scrumcaps - a work-around solution some players have attempted - have also been deemed incompatible with the rules by some referees. The application of laicite to sport's grassroots means that hijab-wearing athletes have usually compromised or dropped out before reaching the biggest stage. But this summer will set their dilemma in the starkest terms: choosing between wearing a national team kit at Paris 2024 and an expression of a personal faith. Elsewhere in sport, expectations have changed. Morocco defender Nouhaila Benzina made history at last summer's Women's Football World Cup. Following Fifa's 2014 rule change to allow the wearing of head coverings for religious reasons, she became the first person to wear a hijab at the World Cup when she took to the field against South Korea. At Rio 2016, fencer Ibtihaj Muhammad made headlines when she became the first American to compete at the Olympics while wearing a headscarf. She was later one of the athletes used to launch a hijab made specifically for sport by a global American sports brand. Another athlete to win a medal at those Games while wearing a head covering - Iran's taekwondo player Kimia Alizadeh - has since emigrated to Germany, where she criticised the Iranian government's policy of \"compulsory hijab\". She competed at the Tokyo Games in 2021 under the flag of the Refugee team and without a religious head covering. Iqra Ismail can speak only for herself, with a perspective from across the Channel in the United Kingdom, where laicite is a foreign concept. She is a director of Hilltop FC, the Female Refugee Football Project Coordinator at QPR Community Trust and a Muslim who has loved sport since she was a child. \"Wearing the hijab is a part of my identity. When it comes to playing, it's not something that I'll leave outside the lines of the pitch,\" she says. \"Football is a human right - everyone should definitely have the right to participate in it.\" Yasmin Abukar is the founder of Sisterhood FC, a women's Muslim football club in London. \"I was asking Muslim girls what made them stop playing football and the answers that they gave me were so sad to hear,\" Abukar says of the inspiration behind the club. \"Half of them stopped because they felt like they didn't belong. The other half felt like they didn't have access to football in a way that will cater to their religious requirements. \"I wouldn't know how I would feel as a young Muslim person being told by the government that I can't have the freedom of practising my religion. \"I'm very thankful that my parents didn't migrate to France.\" Facing disaster - the Forest fans at Hillsborough More than a fighter - how Ronda Rousey found peace Inside the ropes - life as a caddie Two brothers, one club and a 40-year wait 'I couldn't really speak about it' - the decision dividing the WSL"

        "text": " World Athletics' decision to award prize money at the Paris Olympics goes against the Olympic spirit, says the head of cycling's governing body. World Athletics will become the first federation to offer prize money at an Olympics this summer. Gold medallists in athletics events will earn $50,000 (\u00c2\u00a339,400). \"The Olympic spirit is to share revenues and have more athletes compete worldwide,\" UCI president David Lappartient said. \"Not only [to] put all the money on the top athletes but spread the money. \"If we concentrate money on top athletes, a lot of opportunities will disappear for athletes all over the world.\" Given the Olympics' origins as an amateur sports event, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) does not award prize money but distributes funding through international federations (IF) and national Olympic committees (NOC). World Athletics' move, which will be extended to silver and bronze medallists for the 2028 Games, was widely praised by former athletes when it was announced by its president Lord Coe. Asked at the time if prize money went against the Olympic spirit, Coe said: \"I don't see that making life a little easier for the athletes, allowing them maybe to stay on in the sport a little bit longer, to give them the financial independence to train, and maybe in a more sophisticated way is anything other than sitting behind good firm Olympic principles.\" But on Tuesday Lappartient said: \"We really believe that this is not the Olympic spirit. \"The proposal was not discussed.\""

        "text": " \"If I was young now, I would love to go back to running.\" Rose Amankwaah was once dubbed 'the fastest woman in Africa', and has been reflecting on her days representing Ghana on the track after almost 50 years of public service. The 72-year-old is the longest-serving nurse at London's Central Middlesex Hospital, but will retire from her role as a theatre matron at the end of the month. She has received recognition for her service, yet was breaking records before her nursing career began in 1975. \"I was the second-fastest woman in Africa. I took silver in the 100m at the All Africa Games in Nigeria [in 1973],\" Amankwaah told BBC Sport Africa. \"I also won gold in Mexico at the Afro-Latin American Games that year and a Commonwealth Games bronze [relay] medal in New Zealand in 1974.   \"And that will be there forever. Google, wherever you go, my name will be there. \"Being an athlete was wonderful. I really did enjoy it. I still watch athletics; the Diamond League, the World Championships, the Olympics. I even record it so I can watch it after work.\" Rose Asiedua, as she was known before her marriage in 1979, was born in Kumasi, Ghana, and was the youngest of nine children. While her parents worked in their shops in the city's market, as a youngster she found she had a talent for athletics, rising up through the school ranks - first in long jump and high jump, and then in the sprints. Following inter-schools competitions, her talent was noticed by Ghana Athletics. \"We had a coach called Mr Lawson and he told me I was wasting my time on long jump and high jump and that he wanted to train me in the sprints,\" she recalled. \"I then went on to represent the Ashanti region and I came first. That's how it all began.\" After travelling the world representing Ghana on the global athletics stage, Amankwaah followed one of her brothers to England in 1974 and was inspired to get into nursing by a neighbour. But her love of athletics remained, and as she embarked on her studies she began to mix with some of the world's biggest sprinting names.  \"When I came to London, I used to train at what is now called the Linford Christie Stadium,\" she said. \"It used to be the Thames Valley Stadium, and I used to train a little bit with Linford Christie.\" Such was Amankwaah's passion for running that her tutors and employers at the National Health Service (NHS) would rota her sympathetically, so that she could continue her training. She had set her heart on competing at the 1976 Olympics in Canada, but that dream was crushed for reasons beyond her control. \"I had permission from the nursing school to represent Ghana in the 1976 Games in Montreal but then African nations boycotted it,\" she explained. \"I was so disappointed. I'd done my training in the evenings while working in the daytime. And then suddenly we couldn't go.\" As her athletics career came to an end, Amankwaah's medical career began to flourish. After graduating as a nurse, she rose up the ranks in the NHS to become a theatre matron in west London. Her exemplary duty at Central Middlesex Hospital led to her winning the Silver Medal Award, a prestigious honour for outstanding service. But thousands of patients will have passed through Matron Amankwaah's wards without knowing they were being treated by a former international sprinter. For her hospital colleagues, her sporting background was also a surprise. \"I only found out recently - she'd kept it quiet all these years!\" said Linda Lonergan, a ward sister who has worked alongside Amankwaah for 29 years.  \"I was very shocked but very proud of her as well. She's done a lot of things in her life. \"She's a good friend as well as my boss - she's lovely. She's very competent and always very nice to patients. \"She's always smiling which puts them at ease.\" The ward's senior sister, Jayanthy John, credits Amankwaah for always encouraging staff to pursue opportunities for growth. \"It's fantastic to work under her, she always has a positive attitude,\" John said. \"She's always passing on her experience to other colleagues, she never keeps things to herself. Anyone who comes under her will go up and up and up and learn. \"She's like a mum to everyone. We're really privileged to work under her.\" After more than 49 years of service at the hospital, the former medal-winning athlete will leave a big legacy as she enters a new phase of her life. \"Oh we will miss her a lot,\" says Lonergan. \"She's one of the original staff and it just won't be the same without her.\" Amankwaah has four children and 10 grandchildren - with a fair share of sporting prowess sprinkled throughout her family. Her son Kevin recently retired as a professional footballer in the English lower leagues and is now a personal trainer. Three of her grandchildren are also excelling in sport, with one granddaughter a member of Great Britain's gymnastics team, another part of the GB dancing group and a grandson on the books of Tottenham Hotspur's academy. As Amankwaah opens up her treasure trove of pictures and medals, her daughter Lorraine watches on proudly and reflects on her mother's sporting past. \"I feel amazing when I look at my mum's collection and all her stories and pictures that she's shown me since I was younger,\" she told BBC Sport Africa. \"Sport has played a big, big part in this family. When I was younger, and my oldest brother Kevin started playing football, we've always watched it.  \"I'm very proud of my mum.\" Amankwaah says the one thing that links her two careers is complete dedication. \"For nursing you have to commit. You cannot get up in the morning and say you are not going to work,\" she said. \"It's the same as being an athlete. You have to be committed to your training and love the job you're doing. \"For my nursing, I love it. Same as being an athlete.\" After almost half a century of working at the same hospital, Amankwaah will finally hang up her gown in the coming days. So, what will she miss most? \"The staff. I'll miss coming in to work. I love my job. I'll really miss it,\" she said. \"I'm thinking 'When I retire, what will I do?'. But I know what I'll do. \"I'll look after my grandchildren and maybe have a little holiday, a rest. Not getting up at five or six o'clock in the morning!\" Amankwaah is still hoping that one member of her family will follow in her footsteps and become an athlete - with her expert advice on offer. \"One of my grandchildren is five, and I can see she likes athletics. So I hope I can train her to become an athlete one day,\" she added. And, when Amankwaah does finally retire, she looks forward to watching all her favourite sports - as they happen. \"Plenty of time to watch the sports,\" she said with a huge smile. \"I'm looking forward to the Olympic Games in France. I'm going to relax in my chair - not recording it, but watch it live.\"  Revealing the truth about the stories that matter: Meet the caravan park residents who have been mis-sold their properties There's a million ways to get it wrong: John Wilson presents a superbly strange guide to modern life"

        "text": " Jemma Reekie's initial disappointment at claiming silver in the World Athletics Indoor Championships illustrated the significant ambitions of Great Britain's athletes with five months to go until the Olympics. That breakthrough first major medal in the 800m for the 25-year-old was the hosts' fourth and final medal in Glasgow, where Josh Kerr and Molly Caudery starred with golds on home soil.  At the end of a weekend during which GB also won women's 4x400m relay bronze, World Athletics president Lord Coe expressed his excitement for the nation's Olympic prospects this summer. \"We are heading into Paris with the most exciting crop of young athletes I have seen for a few generations,\" he told BBC Sport. Reekie considers Rome diversion before Olympics Kerr's stunning 3,000m victory and Caudery's breakthrough pole vault triumph contributed to a sensational Saturday night for the hosts in Glasgow. And, following Sunday's relay bronze that marked an emotional milestone for twin sisters Laviai and Lina Nielsen, Reekie's hugely popular silver provided a fitting finale to a successful weekend for a small British team that finished fifth in the medal table. The early season promise shown by several global stars, including American sprinter Noah Lyles and Dutch record-breaker Femke Bol has already stirred up excitement for the Paris Games, where the athletics programme begins on 1 August. Before then, British athletes will target the European Championships in Rome in June then aim to secure their Olympic place at the UK Championships on 8 and 9 July. Asked before the championships for his response to reigning Olympic 1500m champion Jakob Ingebrigtsen's assertion that he could beat Kerr \"blindfolded\", the Briton replied \"no comment\". Kerr, who saw off the Norwegian to win world 1500m gold in Budapest last August, instead trusted his fitness to do the talking for him. It did just that as he kicked clear to win his second global title in little more than six months. The Scot has made no secret of his belief he will top the podium in Paris and he continues to justify that self-confidence. Focused on building endurance at the start of this Olympic year, Kerr's success over 3,000m, in which he displayed blistering finishing speed, came after he broke Sir Mo Farah's world indoor two-mile record. He has positioned himself as the man to beat this year. \"Josh [Kerr] has become physically intimidating on a track,\" said Lord Coe.  \"3,000m is a complicated distance indoors, but I thought physically and mentally he had the measure of everyone in that field. The opposition are thinking that as well.\" 'Commanding Kerr keeps head amid Saturday night bedlam' The expectation that accompanied Kerr's arrival in Glasgow is something team-mate Caudery might now have to become accustomed to. So far, though, the 23-year-old Englishwoman has shown she thrives on the biggest stages, taking gold at only her second global championships. Since producing a personal best to finish fifth on her world debut in Budapest, Caudery has emerged as the standout star in her event this year - setting three world leads, each a new lifetime best. Caudery, who beat a world-class field including reigning Olympic champion Katie Moon to take gold in Glasgow, has admitted she enjoys competing as an underdog. Those days, however, are now firmly behind her.  \"Coming into this I didn't think that I could win gold but I think it has reframed my mind and [I can] start believing in myself a little bit more, just thinking I do belong here,\" she told BBC Sport.  Caudery achieves 'dream' gold in 'emotional' final Scot Reekie said she had learned \"a good lesson\" before Paris 2024 after being denied the gold she desperately wanted in front of passionate home support. Despite achieving a breakthrough medal three years after missing out on the Olympic podium by 0.09 seconds, the lack of emotion she showed after crossing the line behind Ethiopia's Tsige Duguma was indicative of the high standards she has set herself. Rejuvenated by a coaching change, Reekie will now set her sights on challenging leading 800m trio Keely Hodgkinson, Athing Mu and Mary Moraa this summer. Fellow Scot Laura Muir had been clear before the event that Glasgow was a \"stepping stone\" in her Olympic preparations - the lure of racing in front of a home crowd being too strong to ignore even though the event didn't fit perfectly into her Paris countdown. The Olympic 1500m silver medallist, 30, was unable to deliver the 3,000m medal the Glasgow crowd hoped to see but her focus remains firmly on the bigger picture - specifically, finding a way to deny the seemingly unstoppable Faith Kipyegon. Kenya's two-time defending Olympic 1500m champion Kipyegon will again provide the greatest obstacle to Muir's bid for a first global title, but the Scot said she has never felt in better shape at this stage of a season. British team captain Laviai Nielsen, now a five-time world relay medallist, went close to her first major individual medal with fourth place in the women's 400m. That event was won by the seemingly unstoppable Bol in world-record time. However, the Dutch athlete will focus her attention on the hurdles in Paris as she aims to upgrade her Tokyo 2020 bronze. But it was the relay final and the chance to at last represent GB alongside her twin sister Lina that arguably meant far more to Englishwoman Laviai - especially when, alongside Ama Pipi and Jessie Knight, they made the podium. Elsewhere for GB, rapidly improving 1500m runner Georgia Bell narrowly missed out on a medal with fourth, while Morgan Lake - fourth at last summer's worlds - was left disappointed in her bid for a first major medal as she placed sixth. Lyles became the first man since Usain Bolt in 2015 to win a world sprint treble last year. In 2024, the American looks poised to launch a bid for a historic quadruple haul of Olympic sprint medals. The world 100m, 200m and 4x100m champion will look to add the 4x400m relay to his targets after a confidence-boosting winter that resulted in silver behind fellow American Christian Coleman over 60m - the event Lyles considers his weakest. He put that plan into action on Sunday, running the third leg of the United States' 4x400m quartet and collecting another silver. Many of his rivals, including Olympic 100m champion Marcell Jacobs and silver medallist Fred Kerley - who accused USA Track & Field of showing favouritism over Lyles' relay inclusion - did not compete in Glasgow, but Lyles has made clear his intention to be in world-record shape by August to stay ahead of them. One athlete already producing record-breaking times in 2024 is Bol. Although the 24-year-old's focus will likely remain the 400m hurdles, she lowered her own indoor 400m world record again in a statement performance. Sweden's Armand Duplantis is no stranger to world records either, but the Olympic and world pole vault champion has not yet hit his usual heights in 2024. Still, that did not prevent him winning his fifth global title in Glasgow. Britain sent a reduced squad of 25 athletes to Glasgow, with many choosing to miss the home championships as they continue to focus on their Olympic preparations. Among the nation's Olympic medal prospects to miss out were world heptathlon champion Katarina Johnson-Thompson and fellow Budapest medallists Hodgkinson, Matthew Hudson-Smith, Zharnel Hughes and Ben Pattison. Sprinters Dina Asher-Smith, the 2019 200m world champion, and Daryll Neita - part of GB's world bronze medal-winning 4x100m quartet - also did not compete but will hope to challenge in Paris. Jake Wightman, crowned 1500m world champion two years ago, is continuing his return to fitness following an injury disrupted 2023 in the hope he can be ready to fight good friend Kerr for gold. In the field disciplines, Olympic pole vault bronze medallist Holly Bradshaw and European indoor long jump champion Jazmin Sawyers are yet to compete this year.

World record holder Tigst Assefa, Megertu Alemu, also of Ethiopia, and Kenya's Joyciline Jepkosgei also beat the previous women's only record of 2:17:01, set by Mary Keitany in 2017. Kenya's Alexander Mutiso Munyao held off distance-running great Kenenisa Bekele to win the men's race in 2:04:01. The British duo of Emile Cairess and Mahamed Mahamed finished third and fourth. Cairess' time of 2:06:46 makes him the second-fastest British man of all-time over the distance and the first to finish on the podium since Sir Mo Farah in 2018. Both Cairess and Mahamed are now set to go to this summer's Olympics after finishing well under the qualifying time of 2:08:10.

Relive London Marathon live text coverage London Marathon photo gallery It was double success for Switzerland in the wheelchair races as Marcel Hug and Catherine Debrunner sealed comfortable victories. Hug, who has now won four successive London Marathons, finished 31 seconds ahead of USA's Daniel Romanchuk, with Great Britain's David Weir third. Debrunner led for a time and finished more than six minutes clear of compatriot Manuela Schar to win her second London Marathon.  Hug and Debrunner win wheelchair races at London Marathon The field for the women's race was considered one of the best ever assembled with three of the four fastest women in history competing. They were on track for women's only record - a record for a marathon run on a course without any male athletes in the race - throughout with the leading pack immediately putting distance between themselves and the rest of the field. When the lead group began to thin it was Jepchirchir, Assefa, Jepkosgei and Alemu left standing. They stayed together until Jepchirchir kicked for home in the last few hundred metres and the 30-year-old Kenyan was able to see off Assefa to win in London for the first time. \"I am feeling grateful. I am so happy for the victory. I was not expecting to run a world record - I knew it might be beat but I did not expect it to be me,\" Jepchirchir told BBC Sport. \"I knew the history and the ladies were strong. I was working extra hard. My time was lower but I've come good today and set a PB. \"I am so happy to qualify for the Olympics and I feel grateful. I'm happy to be at Paris and my prayer is to be there and run well to defend my title. I know it won't be easy but I'll try my best.\" Women's elite race results 1.

Mergutu Alemu (Eth) - 2:16:34 Tributes were paid to 2023 winner Kelvin Kiptum before the men's race. Kenya's world record holder died in a road accident in his home country at the age of 24 in February. That the race ended with another Kenyan winner was fitting but Munyao, 27, was pushed hard by the 41-year-old Bekele for much of the race. Bekele is a three-time Olympic gold medallist with five world titles to his name but has never won the London Marathon. The Ethiopian looked well placed to claim an improbable maiden win but Munyao upped the pace in the closing stages and powered clear to clinch his first win in London. \"At 40km I got some pressure from Bekele but I had a lot of confidence because I trained for this race,\" Munyao told BBC Sport. \"After 40km I thought I had enough energy to win. That's why I kicked and I knew I would win.\" Asked about Kiptum, he added: \"I think about him and let him rest in peace. He came here in London and he won. Let him rest in peace.\" Men's elite race results 1. Alexander Mutiso Munyao (Ken) - 2:04:01 2. Kenenisa Bekele (Eth) - 2:04:15 3. Emile Cairess (GB) - 2:06:46 4.

        "description": "Warning: This article contains references to suicide and mental health issues. ",
        "text": " Warning: This article contains references to suicide and mental health issues.  It all started with one life-changing phone call. In truth, Dave Lock had phoned - and then soon hung up - several times before he could bring himself to engage in any conversation. The 62-year-old was at \"rock bottom\" when he saw an advert for Samaritans on a bus shelter. On Sunday, he will run his 25th consecutive London Marathon in fancy dress for the charity, in the large green telephone costume which has become synonymous with his endeavours. That does not account for his remarkable lockdown-enforced 'patio-thon' in 2020, for which he decorated his patio with pictures of the capital's iconic landmarks and ran 2,175 laps to cover the 26.2 miles. Chosen as captain of the 500-strong team of runners raising money for Samaritans, the London Marathon charity of the year, Lock says it will be a \"dream come true\" to this time complete the event with his daughter, Isabella, as they run in memory of his younger brother Steven, who took his own life last year. \"Steven always used to come and watch the London Marathon and he always used to stand near mile 24,\" says Lock, known as 'Samaritans Running Telephone'. \"It was great to just run up in the telephone costume and high-five him. Then he would name a pub and we would meet after the race. \"Isabella and I know that Steven will be there. We will exchange a high-five with Steven at mile 24.  \"Steven's suicide has made me feel even more committed to doing whatever I can for Samaritans, whether that's running 26 miles or promoting mental health. I have already made a commitment to myself that this London Marathon will not be my last.\" Lock first contacted the charity after going through a divorce which left him with a feeling of \"self-loathing\", that caused him to close himself off from family and friends. Seeking help at his lowest point, the call paved the way for Lock's achievements since. He has completed more than 30 marathons, run almost 900 miles and raised nearly \u00c2\u00a350,000 for the charity. He became a listening volunteer for the charity, which answers a call every 10 seconds, before taking on his first London Marathon in 1999 dressed as children's TV character 'Big Ears' - in recognition of the service Samaritans provides. Since then he has gone on to run the distance as a birthday cake, a mobile phone, a computer, and the iconic green telephone which he will once again wear this weekend. \"I didn't like myself anymore. I got to a point where I couldn't really see any point in carrying on and I seriously considered taking my own life,\" Lock says. \"Now I realise my being here, being open, caring, compassionate, kind, is actually really important.\" \"When I called Samaritans, I was very scared. The voice at the other end was so kind, welcoming and warm and I immediately felt almost as though someone had put their arms around me as if to say 'it's OK, you're in a safe place'.  \"Back in 1999, I told myself I would run 25 consecutive London Marathons to support Samaritans. I'm so delighted that I'm nearly there.\" After losing their mother to cancer, Lock's brother Steven went on to pursue a career in acting and moved to Los Angeles. Unfortunately, the decision did not work out and his mental health deteriorated.  Lock flew out to visit his brother and offer support, but it would be the last time he would see him. \"Isabella has seen me running the London Marathon and she said she would love to run with me one day,\" says Lock. \"Because of what happened last year with Steven, she came to me and said: 'It's time - I want to run the London Marathon with you in memory of Steven'.  \"I will keep running for Samaritans as long as I'm physically able to. I feel so, so passionate that I don't want anyone to die by suicide and I'll do anything I can to stop that.\" If you, or someone you know, have been affected by any issues raised in this article, support and information is available at BBC Action Line."

        "text": " A group of international sports federations say World Athletics' decision to award prize money at the Paris Olympics \"undermines the values of Olympism and the uniqueness of the Games\". Last week World Athletics announced it will become the first federation to offer prize money at an Olympics this summer. Gold medallists in athletics events will earn $50,000 (\u00c2\u00a339,400). In a statement, the Association of Summer Olympic International Federations (ASOIF), said it was \"neither informed nor consulted\", despite World Athletics being one of its members. It said that the federations it represents have \"expressed several concerns\". \"One cannot and should not put a price on an Olympic gold medal,\" it said. \"Not all sports could or should replicate this move, even if they wanted to. Paying prize money in a multi-sport environment goes against the principle of solidarity, reinforces a different set of values across the sports and opens up many questions.\" It added that \"there has been consensus that Olympic revenues should, at least for the more commercially successful and financially independent international federations, be invested as a priority into development and integrity matters\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 it appears that World Athletics' latest initiative opens rather than solves a number of complex issues. \"ASOIF will raise these concerns with World Athletics and will continue to promote dialogue amongst its members and the IOC.\" Given the Olympics' origins as an amateur sports event, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) does not award prize money but distributes funding through international federations, and national Olympic committees. World Athletics' move, which will be extended to silver and bronze medallists for the 2028 Games, was widely praised by former athletes when it was announced by its president Lord Coe. In response to ASOIF's statement, World Athletics said: \"Awarding this prize money to gold medallists in Paris 2024, and then extending it to all medallists in LA 2028, is about underscoring our unwavering commitment to empowering the athletes and recognising the critical role they play in the success of an Olympic Games. \"It is impossible to put a marketable value on winning an Olympic medal. But we think it is important to make sure some of the revenues generated by our athletes at the Olympic Games are directly returned to those who make the Games the global spectacle that it is. \"This is the continuation of a journey World Athletics started back in 2015, which sees all the money received every four years from the IOC's revenue share allocation (approximately $40m) go directly back into our sport.\" It added \"80% of all World Athletics' income goes directly back into the sport\". Earlier this week, David Lappartient, the head of cycling's governing body the UCI, said World Athletics' decision went against the Olympic spirit. Andy Anson, the head of the British Olympic Association (BOA), was also critical, saying he did not think it was \"particularly appropriate or helpful\", and risked creating a two-tier Olympics.  Some national Olympic committees offer financial rewards to their medallists, though the BOA does not. Prize money at Games \"against Olympic spirit\""

        "text": " Sign up for notifications to Insight features via the BBC Sport app and read the latest in the series here. Resting next to the Seine river, the Cite du Cinema is best known for film-making. By July, though, its cavernous studio spaces will be refashioned into the heart of the athletes' village for the Paris Olympics. Athletes from all countries and cultures will be found at the dining hall sitting across from one another sharing meals and stories. It is a multi-cultural melting pot, in which people of all different creeds and colours meet every four years. Yet the dress code for the hosts is different from their guests. In September the International Olympic Committee (IOC) made clear that athletes in Paris can represent themselves and their faith, as well as their country. \"For the Olympic Village, the IOC rules apply,\" an IOC spokesperson told Reuters.  \"There are no restrictions on wearing the hijab or any other religious or cultural attire.\" The French team, though, have been told something different. \"The ban on the hijab [a type of headscarf that covers the head and neck, but leaves the face clear] is the consequence of two discriminations: it is islamophobia, but also gender discrimination,\" says Veronica Noseda, who plays football for Les Degommeuses, a Parisian football club set up to fight discrimination. Assile Toufaily, who moved to Lyon in 2021 having played football at international level for her native Lebanon, agrees. \"It's not really about the French society, it's the government,\" she says. \"There is a hate on Muslim people during these last few years in France and it's shown in sport.\" This summer and the arrival of the Olympics in Paris will be the clearest sporting demonstration of a distinctive and divisive French concept. Liberte, egalite, fraternite, which first appeared during the French Revolution, may be the most famous expression of what France aspires to. It appears at the front of the constitution, on coins, on stamps and on public buildings. Less famous, and harder to translate, is another key tenet of the French republic: laicite.  Most often translated as secularism in English, laicite does not stipulate that France's people should drop any religious customs or symbols, but, instead, that state and public institutions should be expressly free of them. It is an idea that is keenly contested in France, particularly in the wake of a raft of terrorist attacks over the past decade and a parallel resurgence in far-right politics. French President Emmanuel Macron has found himself defining the term again and again. \"The problem isn't laicite,\" he said in a speech in October 2020. \"Laicite in the French Republic means the freedom to believe or not believe, the possibility of practising one's religion as long as law and order is ensured.  \"Laicite means the neutrality of the state. In no way does it mean the removal of religion from society and the public arena. A united France is cemented by laicite.\" A 2004 law attempted to add some clarity to the concept, banning \"ostentatious\" religious symbols from state schools, without naming specific examples. While Sikh turbans, Jewish kippah and large Christian crucifixes have been interpreted as falling the wrong side of laicite, most of the debate has focused around head coverings among the largest Muslim population of any nation in Western Europe. In September, French sports minister Amelie Oudea-Castera - a former professional tennis player who lost to Martina Hingis in the Wimbledon juniors semi-final in 1994 - confirmed that the French Olympic team, as an institution representing and funded by the French public, is bound by laicite. \"It means absolute neutrality in public services,\" she said. \"The France team will not wear the headscarf.\" Athletes from other nations will be free wear religious symbols in the Paris 2024 athletes' village as they wish. However members of the French team, if they are to abide by their nation's rules, can't. The stance has been criticised by some international bodies. \"No-one should impose on a woman what she needs to wear or not wear,\" said a spokesperson for the United Nations Human Rights Office., external \"Prohibitions on the wearing of religious headscarves in public spaces violate Muslim women's rights,\" added human rights charity Amnesty International. In France however, the ban carries considerable support. \"It is a complicated and very, very sensitive issue,\" says Sebastien Maillard, an associate fellow at think tank Chatham House who has reported on French politics and society during his career. \"When I moved from Paris to London, that was one of the main differences. In the United Kingdom religion is displayed quite comfortably, whereas in Paris it is often seen as something more provocative.\" Maillard points to another, smaller, controversy involving Paris 2024's exclusion of religious symbols. In March the Game's official poster - a stylised image of Paris' landmarks coming together to form a stadium - was unveiled. The artist omitted the golden crucifix that stands on top of the Hotel des Invalides, sparking discussion as to how strictly the Games - which will the cost French taxpayers several billion euros - stick to the principles of laicite. \"The debate today more often focuses around a Muslim community, one that wants to be fully part of French society but also follow religion in its own way,\" says Maillard. \"We have this debate over and over about how that fits. \"The French republic was partly founded on a rejection of Catholicism and it feels threatened whenever religion impinges on it. There is a strong fear, particularly among older generations, of religion exerting influence over society and the state.\" The debate plays out in areas where those demographic differences are most pronounced - in education, but also sport. During last year's period of Ramadan - a month-long fast observed between sunrise and sunset by Muslims - the French Football Federation (FFF) sent out an edict to referees not to pause matches to allow players to break their fast, saying these interruptions \"do not respect the provisions of the statutes of the FFF\". This year, with Ramadan coinciding with an international break, the FFF confirmed that it would not alter the timing of meals and practices to accommodate Muslim players, effectively preventing them from fasting while in camp with France's age-grade and senior teams. Lyon midfielder Mahamadou Diawara left France Under-19s' get-together, reportedly because of the restrictions., external Another talented prospect in another sport, basketball player Diaba Konate, who has represented France at under-23 level, has left for the United States, saying the ban on her wearing the hijab has left her \"heartbroken\"., external Even in low-level local matches, female Muslim players are usually banned from wearing a headscarf, on the basis that the leagues are organised and run by public bodies. Protective scrumcaps - a work-around solution some players have attempted - have also been deemed incompatible with the rules by some referees. The application of laicite to sport's grassroots means that hijab-wearing athletes have usually compromised or dropped out before reaching the biggest stage. But this summer will set their dilemma in the starkest terms: choosing between wearing a national team kit at Paris 2024 and an expression of a personal faith. Elsewhere in sport, expectations have changed. Morocco defender Nouhaila Benzina made history at last summer's Women's Football World Cup. Following Fifa's 2014 rule change to allow the wearing of head coverings for religious reasons, she became the first person to wear a hijab at the World Cup when she took to the field against South Korea. At Rio 2016, fencer Ibtihaj Muhammad made headlines when she became the first American to compete at the Olympics while wearing a headscarf. She was later one of the athletes used to launch a hijab made specifically for sport by a global American sports brand. Another athlete to win a medal at those Games while wearing a head covering - Iran's taekwondo player Kimia Alizadeh - has since emigrated to Germany, where she criticised the Iranian government's policy of \"compulsory hijab\". She competed at the Tokyo Games in 2021 under the flag of the Refugee team and without a religious head covering. Iqra Ismail can speak only for herself, with a perspective from across the Channel in the United Kingdom, where laicite is a foreign concept. She is a director of Hilltop FC, the Female Refugee Football Project Coordinator at QPR Community Trust and a Muslim who has loved sport since she was a child. \"Wearing the hijab is a part of my identity. When it comes to playing, it's not something that I'll leave outside the lines of the pitch,\" she says. \"Football is a human right - everyone should definitely have the right to participate in it.\" Yasmin Abukar is the founder of Sisterhood FC, a women's Muslim football club in London. \"I was asking Muslim girls what made them stop playing football and the answers that they gave me were so sad to hear,\" Abukar says of the inspiration behind the club. \"Half of them stopped because they felt like they didn't belong. The other half felt like they didn't have access to football in a way that will cater to their religious requirements. \"I wouldn't know how I would feel as a young Muslim person being told by the government that I can't have the freedom of practising my religion. \"I'm very thankful that my parents didn't migrate to France.\" Facing disaster - the Forest fans at Hillsborough More than a fighter - how Ronda Rousey found peace Inside the ropes - life as a caddie Two brothers, one club and a 40-year wait 'I couldn't really speak about it' - the decision dividing the WSL"

However, Hug had enough left in the tank to drop his competitors in the second half of the race to win comfortably. \"It was a really amazing race but it was also really tough.

        "text": " \"Honestly, I just want to hug Anya in 2019. She just wasn't as happy as I am now.\" The Anya Culling of five years ago would certainly be forgiven for struggling to comprehend how much she has gone on to achieve so quickly. It took her more than four and a half hours to complete the London Marathon in 2019 but on Sunday she will take her place among the race's elite women, having reduced her personal best by two hours. The excitement in the 25-year-old's voice is infectious as she considers how she will feel on the start line. Often nervous pre-race, Culling admits her family would normally need to \"tread on eggshells\" around her. \"Instead I'm dancing around my flat with adrenaline,\" she tells BBC Sport. Culling had little interest in running prior to the pandemic. Her competitive streak had led her to throwing herself \"in at the deep end\" for her first - and still \"most painful\" - marathon. She had also overcome serious health issues to make the start line in 2019, having a benign tumour removed and undergoing radiotherapy to treat an over-active thyroid. \"I just lost a lot of my confidence,\" says Culling, a member of Best Athletics in London. \"I was on steroids and the natural thing is for you to gain a bit of weight. I had been in and out of hospital - I remember getting my GCSE results in hospital and it continued for quite a few years after that. \"Running was a way to be healthy and find that confidence again. I have never been a more confident person and it's not really because of the results but because of how it has made me feel.\" Watch the London Marathon on BBC It was during lockdown that Culling was able to use running to benefit her mental wellbeing. With her background in team sports, it provided a social activity as lockdown rules were relaxed. She has made remarkable progress since. Culling set five consecutive personal bests following her first marathon, culminating in her time of two hours 34 minutes 45 seconds on her England debut in Copenhagen last May. That streak of improvements ended when she ran just 57 seconds slower in Berlin in September - important in itself, Culling says, because it reminded her to \"enjoy the journey\". \"It wasn't until lockdown that I realised the peacefulness of running, and the simplicity of it. That really helped me get through lockdown and it was when I really started enjoying it. I just naturally progressed my training as that continued,\" Culling explains. \"If I'd started running when I was younger, I probably wouldn't enjoy it now. I could easily have taken it all far too seriously. \"For me to realise that, this soon into my journey, that I won't enjoy if it take it too seriously, is a big thing.\" It is an approach which Culling has harnessed as she prepares for her third London Marathon, and her first among the elites alongside runners such as Ethiopia's world record holder Tigst Assefa. Norfolk runner Culling admits she has felt more pressure as her performances have improved - and self-doubt has led to tears during previous preparations. But she has learned to \"take a step back\" and be proud of her achievements to date. \"I have taken a lot of the pressure off myself compared to previous races. I know I just need to keep going and not overthink everything. Hopefully that will pay off,\" Culling says. \"I just never considered I would be able to do this; it was never in my mind. The times and personal bests were always secondary. \"I am blown away whenever I think about what I've done. I still think it's beginner's luck, but then lockdown was a long time ago. \"I just think about myself in 2019, the difference between me then and now. My brother would join me on runs and he'd have to wait at every single corner for me to catch up. I used to walk in cross country at school.\" Now she is preparing to return to the race that has marked significant milestones in her career, having taken almost two hours off her 2019 time - when she was the 7,546th woman - in her most recent London Marathon to be the third British woman across the line in 2022.  Racing in the city which has been her home since 2018, Culling intends to keep that bigger picture sharply within view as she takes the next steps of her whirlwind journey on Sunday. \"It blows my mind when I get messages from people telling me I'm an inspiration to them, I don't really believe it,\" Culling says. \"But I think that motivation will get me through London because I'll be running with the elites and I am still bridging that gap between amateur and elite.  \"Before 2019, I thought the London Marathon was this race to come first but, really, the reason for most people running is bigger than that. They are doing it for someone, for a cause, in someone's memory. \"It was the first marathon I ever did, and the two times I've done it have been pivotal in my running career. I think it will be an emotional one but I will try my best to stay rational.\" Ambition, money and deception: Discover the scandalous true story of Elizabeth Holmes and Theranos Can a quick HIIT workout boost brainpower?

        "text": " Nicole Yeargin admits a disappointing indoor season left her considering her future in athletics - but says she is now fully focused on the \"dogfight\" of securing a place in Team GB's squad for this summer's Olympics in Paris. The 26-year-old Scottish athlete has won World, European and Commonwealth Games bronze medals in the 4x400m relay. But she endured a frustrating start to the year, with a disappointing showing at the British Indoor Championships followed by missing out on the World Indoor Championships in Glasgow. \"When I came off the indoor season I was a little bit like 'what is going on, shall we hang these [spikes] up? I don't know if I have got it in me',\" she told BBC Sport Scotland. \"But then I talked with my coach and realised what went wrong and if we can change it, I have full confidence I can make it back. \"One day you can be on top and one you can be on the bottom, athletics is very unforgiving. \"It sucks to know what I wanted to run and to know what I opened up with last year - 51.0 seconds. That was my goal this indoor season and it did not happen. \"I was a bit confused and it does kind of hit you in the heart - this is what you do, this is your career. \"So it was upsetting to run a slow time over and over again, when I know I could do better. I think that would go through anyone's head. \"I don't want to waste anyone's time, so if it was my time to go it was my time to go. But I came back to practice the next Monday and I was ready to train. I am still here.\" Yeargin, who only took up athletics eight years ago, made her Olympic debut at the last Games in Tokyo and competed in the women's 400m as well as the women's 4x400m and mixed 4x400m relays. Born and based in the United States, Yeargin - who qualifies to race for Scotland and Great Britain through her Scottish mum - believes she is now a more mature athlete. \"I feel like I am definitely an adult now,\" she added. \"I was fresh out of college and think I got hit down by life a couple of times. \"But I am still determined. This is my job now, we didn't just make the team for fun. This is a job - we are here to get paid and put our names in some [history] books. \"People have been waiting for me to take that next step and really dive into my talent. There is just more pressure now. I am not the youngster, I know everybody now - I know what time everybody is running. \"Obviously the 400m girls are my friends so I have just got to find that 'yes you are my friend but I am still going to beat you today' mentality.\" Exciting Team GB squad ready to shine in Paris Meet Britain's sprint twins Lina and Laviai The two-time British 400m silver medallist, who changed her coach towards the end of last year, believes the sprinting landscape in Team GB circles has altered since the Tokyo Games, but remains confident she can secure her seat on the flight to Paris. That depth was shown when Lina Nielsen, Laviai Nielsen, Ama Pipi and Jessie Knight set a new British record time as they claimed bronze in the 4x400m relay final at the World Indoor Championships in Glasgow earlier this month. \"We have got so much stronger in the last three years,\" Yeargin said. \"You have got Amber Anning running fast, you have got the collegiates, you have got the professionals - a lot of them running fast - so it is going to be a dogfight this year. \"I make my own schedule, that is the maturity of knowing what I can and can't do and when I should do something and I when I shouldn't. \"Last time in Tokyo it was all planned out for you, this year I plan out my schedule - when I want to race, what I want to do, how I can improve. That is helpful.\" Revealing the truth about the stories that matter: Meet the caravan park residents who have been mis-sold their properties There's a million ways to get it wrong: John Wilson presents a superbly strange guide to modern life"

        "text": " Born in Nigeria. Bred in Glasgow. Bound for the NFL?  Praise Olatoke has walked the unconventional path in life before, so when the opportunity arose to swap the running track for the American football field, the decision came quicker than a 100m sprint.  The 23-year-old finds himself in the final weeks of the NFL's International Player Pathway, in which 16 athletes from the around the world who may never before have known the brown leather of a football are given the opportunity to step on to the sport's biggest stage.  Some would be daunted by ditching their successful career in athletics to pursue a notoriously cut-throat and gruelling new discipline, going from short-distance sprinter to wide receiver.  What were the biggest deals of 2024's NFL free agency?  Rees-Zammit 'loving' NFL camp as he chases 'dream' But, when asked if he can envisage a scenario where he catches the winning touchdown in a Super Bowl, it is clear Olatoke has taken that Scottish gallus streak stateside.  \"1000%,\" he tells BBC Scotland. \"Crazier things have happened, so I wouldn't say this is out of the ordinary. I think it's bound to happen - and it will happen. It's only a matter of time.\" Bold. But this dream isn't one that recently sprung into the young man's mind. While he was representing Scotland in athletics, scorching out the blocks and climbing the world rankings, his finish line looked different.  American football has grown exponentially in the UK over the past decade. Yet still, there are probably not many kids kicking about the playgrounds of Glasgow's schools telling their pals they are going to play in the NFL one day.  Olatoke, on the other hand, told anyone who would listen.  \"You could ask my friends in high school - I would tell them I'm going to play American football,\" he says.  \"I don't know how, I don't know where. It's always been something since I was 15 I wanted to do. Now that the doors are open, I have to take it. \"It's been a grind, honestly, but I can definitely see improvement. From day one, I could barely understand which players go where. Now I'm able to visualise play concepts, so I'm seeing a massive improvement.\" On Wednesday, Olatoke will put that improvement to the test when the IPP's class of 2024 - which includes Wales rugby union superstar Louis Rees-Zammit - show their new skills in front of scouts from across the United States.  Impress them and a spot on one of the league's 32 franchises could be his. Not only would it be a proud moment for the former Ohio State runner as an individual but also as one of the few Scots to compete in the NFL.  \"I was born in Nigeria but moved to Scotland when I was five,\" Olatoke says. \"My family are still based there and I lived there until I was 18. I did all my schooling in Glasgow.  \"I grew up and represented Scotland in athletics, so it would be sick to represent Scotland in American football. It's definitely a goal of mine, to be one of the few people that means Scotland can say 'we have an NFL player'. \"Scotland has athletes. I don't see why American football can't come to Scotland and why Scottish people can't thrive and play American football at a high level.\" Despite the short list of names to go from Scotland to America's most popular sport, the saltire has been flown at the Super Bowl.  Greenock-born Lawrence Tynes kicked field goals in both of the New York Giants' 2008 and 2012 Vince Lombardi trophy successes.  If Olatoke can achieve his immediate goal of earning a jersey, it won't be long before he will seek to be the next Scot to slip one of those illustrious Super Bowl rings on to his finger.  \"That's every player's dream,\" he says. \"You don't work this hard for this long, and put yourself through all this, to not at least try and win a Super Bowl. \"It's definitely something I want to see for myself in the future.\""

Mnangat told the BBC that the trio ran as pacemakers.

After the race, the Chinese Athletics Association said it would seek to improve the organisation of road running events in the country. \"In general, the overall operation of road running events has been smooth,\" it said in a statement.  \"But problems in the organisation and management of the events have also been exposed, which has aroused widespread concern.\" China's He won marathon gold at the 2023 Asian Games in Hangzhou and is his country's record holder for the full marathon."

        "text": " Sweden's Armand Duplantis broke his own men's pole vault world record in the opening Diamond League meeting of the season in Xiamen, China.  Duplantis, 24, cleared 6.24m, one centimetre above the mark he set in last September's Diamond League final. It was the eighth time the reigning Olympic and world champion has broken the outdoor world record. The US-born athlete is aiming to win a second Olympic gold at the Paris Games this summer. Duplantis, whose stunning start to the outdoor track and field programme followed a second world indoor title in March, said it was \"exciting to get my season going\". He entered the competition in Xiamen at 5.62m and also cleared 5.82m and 6.00m before being roared on by the crowd at the Egret Stadium to set a new world mark at his first attempt.  American Sam Hendricks finished second with 5.82, while China's Bokai Huang was third with 5.72. He's got \"God's hand on his back\" said Hendricks of Duplantis, and added: \"I've seen him from a 14-year-old come all the way up and it makes me actually ever joyous to be even just second place behind the world record holder because I know he works so darned hard.  \"He goes all over the place and he's becoming the true champion we all want him to be.\" Watch Diamond League Xiamen on BBC iPlayer Diamond League 2024 season preview Elsewhere, Australian teenager Torrie Lewis shocked world 100m champion Sha'Carri Richardson in the women's 200m.  American Richardson, who took 200m bronze at the World Championships in Budapest last year, thought she had done enough to edge it in a blanket finish.  But 19-year-old Lewis ghosted through in lane nine to clinch victory by three hundredths of second, winning in 22.96 seconds. America's Tamara Clark was third in 23.01. Ethiopia's Gudaf Tsegay, the reigning Olympic women's 10,000m champion, produced the third-fastest time ever in the 1500m, clocking 3:50.30 to win, with compatriots Birke Haylom and Worknesh Mesele finishing well back in second and third. Women's world 400m champion Marileidy Paulino got the season under way with victory in the first event on the track. The 27-year-old, from the Dominican Republic, slowed in the closing stages but eased over the line in 50.08 seconds, ahead of Poland's Natalia Kaczmarek, with the United States' Britton Wilson in third.  Olympic champion Jasmine Camacho-Quinn overcame a poor start to edge a thrilling women's 100m hurdles, timing her charge to the line to perfection to win in 12.45 seconds, ahead of Bahamas' Devynne Charlton by four hundredths of a second.  Canada's Marco Arop won the men's 800m in 1:43.61, pipping Kenya's Wycliffe Kinyamal by just five hundredths, while Great Britain's Ethan Hussey was 10th.  Ethiopia's Lamecha Girma, Olympic silver medallist in the 3,000m steeplechase, won the men's 5,000m, dipping under 13 minutes to finish in 12:58.96 in his first completed elite race at the distance.  The night ended with victory for world 60m indoor champion Christian Coleman in the men's 100m, as he pulled away in the middle part of the race to win in 10.13secs, ahead of American team-mate Fred Kerley and Jamaica's Ackeem Blake."

        "publication_date": "2024-04-16T07:58:46.000Z",
        "description": "\"I reckon there were a few people looking around thinking 'who is this guy?',\" Ben Pattison says.",
        "text": " \"I reckon there were a few people looking around thinking 'who is this guy?',\" Ben Pattison says. \"I feel like I did surprise quite a few people. Some of them had probably never even heard of me. Now I know they definitely have.\" It took less than 105 seconds for Pattison, Great Britain's last-minute 800m qualifier, to propel himself from relative unknown to Olympic medal threat. At least in the eyes of his competitors, anyway. Achieving World Championship bronze in August was a moment of wide-mouthed disbelief long in the making for the then 21-year-old, whose setbacks include a potentially life-threatening heart condition. Nicknamed 'Fireball' by team-mate Matthew Hudson-Smith, Paris 2024 has been the target since the red-headed Pattison defied the odds to go agonisingly close to Olympic qualification for Tokyo as a teenager. A hard-earned, guilt-free off-season in the United States aside, he could not have hoped to set himself up any better for an attempt at becoming Britain's first Olympic men's 800m medallist since Sebastian Coe 40 years ago. \"I still don't think the fact I'm a world medallist has fully sunk in and I don't think it will until I look back on my career,\" Pattison, 22, tells BBC Sport. \"It has given me a lot more confidence in training, and in life really. I can push myself a lot harder now knowing I am one of the best in the world.  \"I want to push on by matching or even topping that at the Olympics. There will be a target on my back, because people actually know who I am, but I'm looking forward to the challenge. I feel like I can beat anyone on my day.\" The journey to becoming the first British man to win a world 800m medal since Peter Elliott in Rome, 36 years earlier, has been far from smooth for the Loughborough business analytics graduate. Pattison feared none of this would be possible when he was told to stop running at the age of 18 after being diagnosed with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome, the condition which caused his heart to beat up to 250 beats per minute in training. Initially annoyed that his brand new heart-rate monitor must be faulty, and having informed doctors that stopping running was not an option, he had successful surgery during the pandemic - which involved burning away a part of his heart. \"I have been fine ever since the operation but it is something that can come back,\" says Pattison, who continues to have regular check-ups. \"I remember my first race after the operation, I was pretty emotional because I didn't know if I'd make it back from that. I didn't know of anyone having that operation and making it back to the top level before, so it was all new to me.  \"A year later I was in the European under-23 final and I came fourth, which I wasn't very happy with, but that was almost exactly a year on from when I had my operation and I remember thinking 'OK Ben, think of the bigger picture, you could not be running at all'.\" He has certainly made up for what he perceives as lost time, with a rapid rise to global prominence since. The whirlwind experience of the World Championships in Budapest, three years after his heart scare, came 12 months after he took Commonwealth Games bronze in Birmingham at his first major championships. He qualified for the Worlds at the very last opportunity, running a personal best one minute 44.02 seconds on home soil at the London Diamond League, and could barely sleep after reaching the final five weeks later. Fortunately, Pattison is at ease when things are moving fast. And the relaxed nature in which he discusses his ambitions for a potentially career-defining date with destiny in Paris suggests little will faze him as he transitions from going under the radar to main contender status. Having already achieved the Olympic qualifying standard, Pattison's immediate priority will be to make the top two at the British trials in June to secure his Team GB place. Yet to win a British title, he says that is motivation in itself. \"It's about putting three or four years of missing out and not making teams into one and hopefully coming out on top,\" says Pattison. \"To be on top of the Olympic podium is definitely a goal for the future and I can't see why I don't do it this year. \"If I do get a medal, hopefully my parents will be able to stay and watch the podium ceremony this time. They didn't realise the medal presentation was the next day in Budapest, so their flight home was the evening of the final and they unfortunately didn't get to see that.  \"Hopefully they are planning for that this year.\" ABBA's definitive story: How much do you really know about Sweden\u00e2\u0080\u0099s biggest musical export?

        "text": " It was another unscripted moment of genius, another masterful flourish from a man approaching 20 years at the very top of his game.  LeBron James picked up possession in the corner during a mid-January meeting with the Houston Rockets. He looked to shoot - a three-pointer. As he did so, his Los Angeles Lakers team-mate Dennis Schroder teased from the bench behind: \"Bet you won't make it.\"  \"To make a bet official you gotta look a man in the eye,\" James later said. And that's exactly what he did; releasing the ball on its arc towards the net before quickly turning to face up the wager, his back to the court as the net rippled and bedlam broke loose.  James, in his 18th NBA season, had turned 36 two weeks earlier. Yet he appears to be having more fun than ever, and is still inflicting misery on the rest of the league.  Here, former coaches, team-mates and opponents chart the rise of this remarkable player; from teenage prodigy to fully fledged superstar and beyond.  Their analysis helps frame the ways in which this unique sportsperson has evolved through the years to remain not only relevant and successful but ahead of the pack. In the summer of 2003, James was putting in extra work before his rookie season. Aged only 18, he had long been regarded as basketball's next great hope.  He was the cover star of the prestigious Sports Illustrated magazine while still a junior in high school. For years it had been predicted he would be the number one pick in the 2003 NBA draft - and sure enough he was. Selected by his hometown team the Cleveland Cavaliers, rarely has a teenager carried such high expectations into their professional debut.  Throughout that summer, James travelled to the Cavaliers' practice facility - a 40-minute drive from where he grew up in Akron, Ohio - for intense one-to-one training with Bob Donewald Jnr, one of the team's assistant coaches. After one session, coach and superstar-in-waiting chatted during a cool-down routine. \"I wasn't great today,\" James said. \"It wasn't a great workout.\" \"You were alright. It's been a long week,\" replied Donewald, who had pushed the teenager hard across consecutive days of gruelling work in preparation for the 82-game season. \"LeBron, I just want you to be great. That's why I'm pushing you.\" \"I am great,\" James responded, a flat, serious expression washing over his face. \"If you want me to be the greatest ever, I'm with that.\"  No-one was more aware of the future that had been written for him than James himself. No-one better appreciated the work required to fulfil that promise. \"Every cut, every shot, every move he made - you'd have thought it was a Game 7 finals, the intensity with which he went,\" Donewald remembers of those early one-to-one sessions. \"I'm trying to crush this kid in a workout just to teach him a lesson, and he is bringing it and bringing it. \"Everybody was hard on him too - the players, head coach Paul Silas. They were friendly, but they weren't going to hand it to this kid, and he didn't want it handed to him.\"  James also understood the highest echelons of superstardom are only attained when the pageantry of elite sport is embraced; that you create your own myth before selling it to the world. At half-time in a pre-season intra-squad scrimmage, some of the Cleveland players decided to do battle in an impromptu slam dunk contest. James watched from the sidelines while established players entertained the crowd with an array of athletic jams. But those who'd stuffed the arena to capacity were really there to see one man. \"He looks at me and grins ear to ear,\" Donewald says of the moment James decided to take centre stage. \"He says, 'watch this'. I said, 'are you going to take over this place?' He said, 'I'm about to take over this place'.\" James proceeded to run through a sequence of stunning slam dunks. Showcasing his once-in-a-generation athleticism, he rose higher than any of his team-mates, his head above the rim as he stuffed the ball through the basket. He passed the ball between his legs and around his back as he ascended. The crowd had got what they came for. \"The place went wild,\" Donewald says. \"In the second half, he came out and just torched it. And from then on in practices, it was some next-level stuff.\" When it came time to dub the rookie with a nickname, the NBA's new showman chose appropriately.  \"I already have a nickname,\" James explained. \"The King.\"  \"Young buck, I ain't calling you King,\" Donewald objected. \"I'm an Elvis Presley fan, and The King is Elvis Presley.\" \"OK, then,\" James said. \"Call me Elvis.\" James' debut arrived on 29 October 2003. The Cavaliers travelled to face the Sacramento Kings for their season opener. Expectations were high, but the teenager still had more than his share of doubters. After all, he had skipped a step on the traditional route to the NBA, going professional straight out of high school - prep to pro - rather than using college basketball as a stepping stone.  On the cross-country flight to California, coach Silas turned to Donewald and asked: \"This fella gonna deliver? He is a rookie.\" \"Yeah,\" Donewald replied confidently. \"I think he is.\" \"I think he will, too,\" Silas smiled. Cleveland lost the game 106-92, The King outdone by the Kings, but James could hardly have impressed more in defeat. His 25 points set a record for a prep-to-pro player on debut, bettering the exalted company of Kevin Garnett, Tracy McGrady and Kobe Bryant. \"The expectations were just incredible,\" Donewald says. \"We weren't talking about 'he needs to be a good player'. We were talking about 'he needs to be one of the best rookies ever'.  \"Everywhere we went, there were crowds. Instead of going in the front door of the hotel, now we've got to go in the back door. Tickets are now hard to come by. Friends and cousins you haven't heard from in a while want to come to games.  \"It was nuts. It was everywhere we went, because of him, and he just handled it. Nothing ever fazed him in that way, which was just so strange to me. This was an 18-year-old kid. A kid who'd just got out of high school.\" James became the first player in Cavaliers history to be named NBA rookie of the year at the end of his maiden season. His per-game averages of 20.9 points, 5.5 rebounds and 5.9 assists were the bare stats of one of the all-time great debut campaigns.  There was one area of criticism: his jump shot.  In the final two seconds of his debut against the Kings, James launched a three-point attempt, the confidence of a sublime overall display coursing through him. But the ball sailed past the rim and the backboard, straight out of play.  James finished his breakout 2003-04 season with just a 41.7% success rate on field goal attempts, an average which plummeted further to just 29% on shots from beyond the three-point arc. Both figures were short of the league-wide averages of 43.9% and 34.7% respectively. LeBron v Zlatan: \"I will never shut up about things that are wrong\" Again, James got to work. \"Usually it's the coach having to teach the kid that, but not this one,\" says Donewald. \"He just wanted to work on it. Practice is at 10? Hey, let's meet at nine. Let's work. Let's work. \"Confidence in his shot was the biggest improvement. Not that he couldn't shoot - that was the biggest misconception. I thought he could shoot even then. It was just learning how to get into the shot and get his feet down. He had the jump shot, but he had to get the feet right. During the year, he developed that pretty quickly.\" The following season, James shot 47% from the field and 35% from three-point range. His field goal accuracy never again dropped below 47% in the rest of his career, reaching the 50% mark in the 2009-10 campaign when he was crowned the league's Most Valuable Player. By that stage, James had taken Cleveland to a NBA Finals (losing to the San Antonio Spurs in 2007), established himself as one of the league's most dominant scorers - averaging over 30 points per game in 2005-06 and 2007-08 - and its best all-round player.  Without a championship, though, he could not claim to have delivered on his potential. Donewald was on his way out of London's Olympic Stadium when he was tackled to the ground by \"what I thought was a bear\".  As coach of the Chinese basketball team for the 2012 Games, he'd led a procession around the track for the opening ceremony. As his players made their exit through the tunnel, Team USA were about to enter. \"Elvis!\" Donewald shouted, recognising the six-foot-nine 'bear' that had wrestled him to the deck.  \"We did it! We did it!\" James was shouting. A month earlier, James had claimed his first NBA title and was named Finals MVP as the Miami Heat overcame the Oklahoma City Thunder by four games to one. He'd also been named regular-season MVP for the third time.  James' move to Miami in 2010 was tinged with controversy. Many fans and league insiders felt announcing which team he'd join in free agency via a live television special, entitled The Decision, was in bad taste.  \"I'm going to take my talents to South Beach,\" James said on the air, paraphrasing a teenage Kobe Bryant's announcement that he was skipping college to join the NBA in 1996. Cavaliers fans were crushed. But James' decision - if not The Decision - was vindicated by his success in Florida, where he linked up with fellow perennial All-Stars Dwayne Wade and Chris Bosh to create one of the most-feared 'super teams' the NBA has ever seen.  The Heat reached four straight Finals, winning twice - in 2012 and 2013 - and James took his MVP haul to four, just two shy of Kareem Abdul-Jabbar's record of six, and one behind Michael Jordan and Bill Russell. James turned 28 midway through the Heat's 2012-13 championship-winning season. He was at his peak; the full realisation of his teenage promise. Orlando Johnson was part of the Indiana Pacers team that faced James and the Heat in the Eastern Conference Finals that year. A rotation player in the same position, Johnson knew the task of stopping the unstoppable would fall to him in the minutes he saw. \"He sees the court like no other and he could do it all,\" Johnson says. \"He could hit the mid-range; that's when his three-ball was really starting to take off. Just how strong he was; I think he might have been a little bit bigger then - 270, 280 pounds maybe. His passing ability, and just his speed. His speed was off the charts.  Black Lives Matter and basketball's role in discussion on racism \"Trying to keep this guy in front, it was like, man, this is a different beast. During that time especially, he might have been at peak athleticism. \"I think what I respected in him the most was the way he could lock in on a game when it's go-time. You hear about his Game 7 performances throughout his career. He doesn't really lose those games.\"  The series had been close, but the deciding game was a blowout. The Heat won by 13 points and James led all scorers with 32 while also contributing eight rebounds and a team-high four assists. They would face the Spurs in the Finals, and James would claim revenge for 2007's heartbreak thanks to a series-best 25.3 points per game in another 4-3 victory.  \"We saw the levels he could take it to,\" Johnson adds. \"At that time, I don't think any of us could reach it. When he locked in and took it to another level, it was different.  \"A guy like him, he's going to go down as one of the greatest to ever play the game.\" In 2014, James decided to reverse The Decision and take his talents back to Cleveland. In the Heat's fourth consecutive Finals appearance, just a few months before, they'd lost in five games to the Spurs. James opted out of his contract and returned to the Cavaliers as a free agent. In the four years he'd been away, Cleveland had compiled the worst overall win-loss record (97-215) in the NBA. They finished 10th in the Eastern Conference for 2013-14. In Miami, James was the centrepiece of a superstar ensemble. Continuing his quest for championships in Cleveland - who had no NBA titles to their name - would require an effort of leadership as much as skill.  With gifted young point guard Kyrie Irving already on the roster and All-Star power forward Kevin Love acquired from the Minnesota Timberwolves, James' Cavaliers were not without talent, but the group would need inspiration and winning nous. \"I think it's the balance of knowing how good you are and at the same time respecting your team-mates and knowing you need them to win,\" says Jose Calderon, who played for the Cavaliers during the 2017-18 season. \"Some guys forget about that. He doesn't. He's a great team-mate. He was amazing. He was the first one there, and he worked every day. There were no days off.\"  James led the Cavaliers to the NBA Finals in each of the four years of his second spell in Cleveland, taking his personal tally of consecutive Finals appearances to eight. Those around him noticed how he once again elevated his game during the playoffs, year after year. \"He was so ready for that,\" Calderon says. \"For some players, it's difficult to turn it on and off, but you could see he had one more level that was 1,000 times more of everything. More focused. More rest. More rehab. More of anything he needed to do to be ready.\" Had they not coincided with the Golden State Warriors team of Steph Curry, Klay Thompson, Draymond Green and, from 2016, Kevin Durant, the Cavaliers might have collected more championship rings. The one they did win, though, will be forever remembered among the greatest NBA upsets.  Trailing the Warriors 3-1 for the 2016 title, Cleveland fought back to claim a miraculous 4-3 triumph - a comeback on that scale had never been pulled off before in Finals history.  \"Cleveland, this is for you!\" an emotional James screamed at the end of his post-game interview on the court. He had delivered the city's first professional sports title. All was forgiven for his years in Miami. Alongside Irving's winning shot in Game 7, James' chase-down block on Andre Iguodala - sprinting to leap and swat away a lay-up attempt - was the iconic play of the series. It is telling that a signature play in the career of one of basketball's greatest and most complete offensive talents is a hustle effort on defence to snuff out what seemed a certain score for the opposition. \"That just showed the commitment,\" says Neal Meyer, an NBA executive who served as a video co-ordinator for the Cavaliers in 2009-10. \"Giving a little bit extra effort to get there and make that block, which changed everything.\" Calderon says: \"When people ask me about LeBron, I always say: he's maybe not the best scorer; he's maybe not the best rebounder; he's maybe not the best with assists. But all around, I think he's the best player. He's the most complete player.  \"He can play defence. He can see the floor; he can see his team-mates. He knows what he wants in every moment of the game. I think that's what sets him apart.  \"They can't do what he can do on the court.\" When his contract in Cleveland expired, at the end of the 2017-18 season, James decided to move on once again, albeit this time in less controversial fashion. At the age of 33, he signed with the LA Lakers.  One of the NBA's storied franchises, the Lakers boast some of the game's most illustrious names among their club legends and have won 17 championships - but they hadn't posted a winning record since the 2012-13 season. Returning the Lakers to their former glories would be a difficult task even for James, but one that would cement his legacy if he achieved it. \"He was still a leader, incredibly team-oriented,\" says Clay Moser, a former assistant coach on the Lakers who'd previously worked with James at the Cavaliers in 2010.  \"Quite frankly, that's the way he's been since he was a young man, probably before he even hit double digits as a person. He's obviously ageing, but his skill-sets are all still incredible. He works like no other. He's an early riser, keeps himself in impeccable condition. \"He's all about winning. And he's all about working to make sure you're in a position to win.\" In 2018-19, a groin injury meant James played only 55 of the Lakers' 82 regular-season games, the most he'd had to sit out in his career. LA finished with a 37-45 record. James missed the playoffs for the first time since 2005. \"I remember the game he got hurt,\" Moser says. \"It was Christmas Day and we were at Golden State. I was close enough that I heard his groin pop a little bit, and he heard it too. He knew he was hurt bad. But, in classic fashion, he worked hard at his rehab, he worked hard at his therapy, and he came back as quickly as he could. Unfortunately for us, it was a little bit too late.\" Before the next season, 2019-20, the Lakers completed a crucial trade to acquire Anthony Davis from the New Orleans Pelicans. LA gave up three young talents and a handful of future draft picks to acquire one of the most talented forwards in the game.  With an elite scorer now on his side, James adapted his game. While still averaging a healthy 25.3 points - rising to 27.6 in the playoffs - he became more of a facilitator, posting a league-high and career-best average of 10.2 assists per game.  James withdrew into the backcourt, effectively acting as the Lakers' point guard for the majority of possessions. He would instigate moves from deep, spring fast breaks with arrow-like passes or draw the attention of defenders before offloading to an open team-mate. \"I think he probably could've led the league in assists any year he wanted to,\" Moser says. \"But when they got Davis and they retooled the team in the manner they did, I think he set his mind to the fact Davis is going to be the primary go-to guy. LeBron was going to make sure everybody got easy looks at the basket, and that's exactly what he did.\" Interrupted by the coronavirus pandemic, 2019-20 ended with the final regular-season rounds and all of the playoffs taking place in a fan-less 'bubble' at Disney World, Florida.  It also ended with the Lakers collecting their first championship in a decade. It was a fourth ring for James and a fourth Finals MVP crown. Powered by James and Davis, the Lakers are favourites to repeat their 'bubble' success in 2021. James is now 36 but showing no signs of slowing. With the care he has paid to his physical shape and wellbeing throughout his career, and with Abdul-Jabbar's all-time NBA scoring record in his sights - 35,171 to the leader's 38,387 - he is as motivated as ever.  \"He's still one of the best players in the world,\" Moser says.  \"He doesn't have these ups and downs in terms of his conditioning. He's always in great shape. He's always ready to go. He's incredibly strong - like, incredibly strong. He's got north-south quickness. He's got great hand-eye coordination. All those sorts of things.  \"If he is declining, I'd hate to see guys that really are.\"  Supporting your immune system: Can eating certain foods help?

An NBA investigation found the 24-year-old disclosed confidential information about his fitness to sports bettors and limited his participation in games for betting purposes.  Porter also bet on NBA games using a friend's online account. NBA commissioner Adam Silver said Porter's \"blatant violations\" warranted the \"most severe punishment\". \"There is nothing more important than protecting the integrity of NBA competition for our fans, our teams and everyone associated with our sport,\" said Silver. \"Which is why Jontay Porter's blatant violations of our gaming rules are being met with the most severe punishment.\" The investigation found that Porter disclosed information about his fitness to someone he knew to be a sports bettor before a game against Sacramento Kings in March. Porter then claimed to be ill and only played for three minutes. Another associate of Porter had placed an $80,000 (\u00c2\u00a364,000) bet that he would under-perform in that game. But, because of Porter's actions and suspicious betting activity, the wager, which would have paid out $1.1m (\u00c2\u00a3880,000), was frozen and not settled. It was also found that Porter bet $54,000 on 13 NBA games using a friend's online account between January and March 2024. None of the games were ones Porter played in. NBA players are forbidden from betting on NBA games under league rules. \"While legal sports betting creates transparency that helps identify suspicious or abnormal activity, this matter also raises important issues about the sufficiency of the regulatory framework currently in place, including the types of bets offered on our games and players,\" added Silver. The NBA said the investigation remains open and may result in further findings."

        "text": " All eyes will be on Caitlin Clark when the Women's National Basketball Association season begins on 14 May. Clark, 22, will make her debut in the professional league after she was selected by the Indiana Fever as the first pick in the draft. She broke major records in college and has boosted the popularity of women's basketball. BBC Sport looks at the 'Caitlin Clark Effect'. Clark makes women's basketball the hottest ticket around Boosting profile of women's sport 'the coolest part' - Clark Clark, who is 6ft tall, was born in Des Moines, Iowa. She attended the University of Iowa, where she starred as a point guard for her college basketball team, the Iowa Hawkeyes. The Hawkeyes reached their first National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division I women's basketball championship game in 2023 and also made the final this year, but lost both. Clark is the all-time leading scorer in men's and women's college basketball, with 3,951 points, breaking the record held by Pete Maravich for 54 years. She averaged 28.4 points, 7.1 rebounds and 8.2 assists per game and also made a NCAA record 201 three-pointers this season, smashing the mark of 162 held by Golden State Warriors star Stephen Curry and former Liberty Flames guard Darius McGhee. Clark's performances led to record viewing figures in the USA, with 18.9 million people watching this season's NCAA final. The Hawkeyes have since retired her number 22 jersey. As expected, Clark was selected first in the WNBA draft by the Indiana Fever and is already having a major impact. The Fever will have 36 of their 40 regular-season games broadcast nationally, compared to one last year. They had the second-lowest attendance of the 12 WNBA teams in 2023, but that trend is unlikely to continue. Clark's Fever jersey is the top-selling jersey in history for a draft pick, according to retailer Fanatics., external Clark is expected to sign a contract with the Fever worth $338,000 (\u00c2\u00a3271,000) over four years. Last year's number one pick in the NBA draft, Victor Wembanyama, secured a $55m (\u00c2\u00a344m) four-year deal. US President Joe Biden and Pittsburgh Steelers quarterback Russell Wilson are among the notable figures to criticise the disparity. Clark is reportedly set to sign an eight-figure endorsement deal, external with Nike, including a signature shoe. Clark was called up to the USA team roster for a training camp on 3-5 April but could not attend because the Hawkeyes were still in the NCAA tournament. The USA, who are targeting an eighth consecutive Olympic gold at Paris 2024, have until 7 July to submit their team. The competition starts on 28 July."

It is the first time in NBA history there has been a three-way tie for top spot with one game left.

At the top, Oklahoma City beat the Milwaukee Bucks 125-107 while Minnesota were 109-106 winners against Atlanta.  Oklahoma City lead the Conference because of their superior head-to-head record between the other two sides, with Minnesota second and Denver third.

The Knicks recorded a 111-104 win over the Philadelphia 76ers, while the Cavaliers beat the Orlando Magic 97-83. Josh Hart and Jalen Brunson led the Knicks with 22 points each as the second seeds responded to Philadelphia's third-quarter surge by pulling in front late on to seal victory. The Cavaliers never trailed the Magic in an impressive showing, with Donavon Mitchell scoring 30 points. The Nuggets beat the Lakers in all of their regular season games but made a slow start before a 13-0 run in the third quarter put them in control. Anthony Davis hit 32 points for the Lakers and LeBron James added 27 as they threatened a late comeback, but Denver held firm. While the Suns won all three of their regular season games against the Timberwolves, the hosts turned the tables in game one of the play-offs as Anthony Edwards starred with 33 points. Suns star Kevin Durant hit 31 points but his side faded badly in the third quarter, with Edwards trash-talking Durant after hitting a three-pointer.

        "text": " As Jonathan Irons emerged from prison, Maya Moore fell to her knees. It took a moment for her strength to return. Then she got up and embraced him, a free man for the first time in over 23 years. Irons' first steps outside that building were also the last on a path the two had been walking together for more than a decade. Once she had regained composure, Moore turned to the phone filming the momentous occasion and said: \"OK guys. It's done. It's over.\" This is the story of their extraordinary journey. The 2020 WNBA season started on 25 July. The Minnesota Lynx are aiming for a fifth title but for the second season in a row they are doing it without one of their star players. Back in 2011, Moore was a first-round draft pick for the Lynx. Since then, she has helped them win four championships and was named MVP in the 2014 season. The 31-year-old also has two Olympic and two World Championship gold medals. Some would argue she is the best the WNBA has seen. But in early 2019 she shocked the sport by giving it all up because of a man she had met 12 years before. A man who had become like a brother to her. Although he was just 16 when the crime took place, Irons was tried as an adult. On 14 January 1997, someone entered the home of Stanley Stotler, situated in a white working-class suburb of St Louis, Missouri. When Stotler returned, the burglar shot him in the head. Stotler survived and was initially unable to identify the perpetrator in a line-up of six photos. According to the New York Times,, external a police officer asked him to make his best guess and he pointed at a picture of Irons and another one of a different African-American man. Later, at a preliminary hearing, Stotler identified Irons as the assailant. But there were no fingerprints connecting the teenager to the crime. No DNA or blood evidence. No corroborating witnesses. A public defender would not allow Irons to take the stand to proclaim his innocence, saying he was too young and uneducated. Prosecutors said Irons had admitted the offence, something he and his lawyers denied. The officer who questioned Irons was alone and did not record the interview. At the time of the trial, in October 1998, American politicians were running on tough-on-crime platforms. There were particularly harsh sentences for young offenders handed out. A prosecutor is quoted as saying about Irons:, external \"Don't be soft on him because he is young. He is as dangerous as somebody five times that age.  \"We need to send a message to some of these younger people that if you are going to act like somebody old, you are going to be treated like somebody old.\" In December 1998, aged 18, Irons was convicted of assault and burglary by an all-white jury and sent to prison for 50 years. In 2007, nine years into that sentence, an 18-year-old Moore travelled to Missouri to visit family and met Irons through the prison ministry they were involved with. Over the years that followed, she continued to return to Jefferson City - her hometown - to visit Irons. She sent him books by her favourite writers and spoke to him on the phone before big games. Eventually, she decided to press pause on her basketball career. Why? Because she always believed Irons was telling the truth. \"There's something about truth that makes you believe it's going to happen,\" Moore says. \"He just had to keep believing that if we could get the truth in front of the right people, who want to do the right thing, they'll do it.\" So in early 2019, when she was supposed to be preparing for the new WNBA season, Moore got to work with Irons and his lawyers to request a retrial. She dedicated herself to the cause. Some 21 years after Irons' conviction, state prosecutors were still not willing to admit defeat. They tried to prevent a review but were unsuccessful and, in October 2019, Irons was finally able to state his innocence in front of a judge. On 9 March 2020, Irons' conviction was overturned. Judge Daniel Green described the original case as \"very weak and circumstantial at best\". In his decision, the judge cited a fingerprint found inside a door in Stotler's home that matched neither Stotler nor Irons. It was evidence that could have proved someone else committed the crime, but it was never turned over to the defence team in the trial in 1998. Irons' story is not unique and it is rooted in systems and issues unimaginably complicated to unpick. The 2016 Netflix documentary 13th shone a light on statistics demonstrating how prisons in the United States are disproportionately filled with African-Americans. Perhaps the most eye-opening one was this: while a white male in the country has a one in 17 chance of ending up behind bars, for black males it is one in three. But sometimes for change to happen, statistics are not enough. It takes a real, human story. The death of George Floyd in Minneapolis, Minnesota sparked reaction across the world. People saw Floyd as a father, a brother, someone who called out for his mother in his dying moments. Just as Floyd's death has started a global conversation on race, Moore hopes Irons' story can lead to change in the American justice system. \"This is an issue of long-term dehumanisation that has been expressed intentionally through systems in our country,\" she says. \"The systems that were intentionally woven into the fabric of our home are still here and have been impacting us for generations.  \"George Floyd was a human being and all the other lives are human beings. When you dehumanise someone, you become dehumanised as well.\" At the click of a button, you can sign an online petition to ask for a wrongfully convicted person to be freed. But that is not how Moore operates. She is not asking every athlete to quit their job and join her. But she also does not care what your social media says. It is what people do when no-one is looking that matters. Moore fought against the dehumanisation she speaks of by playing checkers with Irons. She visited him on public holidays. When he was freed, she invited Irons into her home. Her whole philosophy can be boiled down into three words: keep showing up. \"If you have any sort of power or resources, you give it up and you power others,\" she says. Moore believes in sacrificing what she has to lift others up and in turn become a better person. It is a selflessness many of us would not have the strength to access. But selflessness is perhaps what the world needs to drive real change. And being so intertwined with one man's future means that, though she has been successful on this occasion, she knows exactly how hard the struggle could get. When asked what she has learned in the process of Irons' release, the list is lengthy and the scope of issues overwhelming. Should drug laws be changed? Are the police overfunded? Are they underfunded? What is better, punitive or restorative justice? How can voting procedures be changed? Prosecutorial reform has been the main focus of Moore's and Irons' fight. But she now knows the importance of criminal justice reform and of changing the USA's approach to imprisonment. \"It's so broad,\" says Moore. \"When I first started getting educated I was so overwhelmed - as we all are, those who have been having their eyes opened more recently.\" If there is an immense amount of work to do, Moore knows she cannot do it all and she is not alone in her fight. She has inspired other athletes to follow her lead. Former University of Connecticut team-mates Renee Montgomery and Tiffany Hayes are both taking this WNBA season off to help with voter registration and social justice reform. For now, Moore will be sticking to prosecutorial reform. Her campaign, Win With Justice, seeks to challenge a \"win\" culture that is considered to be \"eroding the trust our community must have in those charged with promoting public safety\". She says: \"I see such a connection between sports and the leadership that prosecutors have of winning and losing. What is a win and what is a loss? \"I will continue to try to help and share and empower others to do the same.\" It is not yet clear what form Moore's continued work will take, nor whether she will return to basketball. The release of Irons, who is now 40, may be the end of one journey for him and for Moore, but it will not be the end of their friendship. \"I can't,\" Irons says when Moore asks him to describe his emotions for the camera capturing the moment of his release. He shakes his head a few times before eventually muttering: \"Life.\" He pauses, then continues: \"I feel like I can live life now. I thank everybody that supported me - Maya and her family. I'm so grateful to have somewhere to be home.\" He wipes tears from his eyes before pulling up a face mask that was made for him by other inmates. It has \"hope\" written on it because that is what they need. That is what Irons and Moore have needed for the past 13 years. \"I'm not going to forget them,\" he says. \"And I'm going to help the ones that I can.\""

        "text": " Sign up for notifications to the latest Insight features via the BBC Sport app and find the most recent in the series here. Dressed in an all-white suit, sitting next to his father in a room full of hope and anxiety, basketball player Len Bias had been waiting for this moment his whole young life.  At the NBA draft of 1986, Bias was 22 years old. He was 6ft 8in and weighed 15st (95kg). Pundits had already labelled him the best prospect around - better even than 1984's third pick, Michael Jordan.  Bias duly went high and early. His name was called out second. The Boston Celtics, who had just won a second NBA Championship in three years but secured an early pick via a deal with the Seattle Sonics two years earlier, added him to their roster. The green Celtics cap thrust into his hand represented ambition and expectation for a side built around ageing champions.  As wild cheers rung out, he hugged his dad before striding up on stage to shake NBA commissioner David Stern's hand, cameras trained on his every move. Grainy film shows a glimpse of how Bias had built his reputation to this point. He had already mastered a silky-smooth jump shot other players spend years crafting. He was explosive, athletic, destined for superstardom - it should have been just the start of the showreel. Instead, short clips are all we have. Two days after being drafted to the Celtics, Bias died from a cocaine overdose. His death shook basketball, but the reverberations went far further, touching America's street corners, courtrooms and highest offices for years after. Bias drifts wide, unnoticed by the defence, and calls for the ball. His team-mate Jeff Adkins spots him and floats the ball towards the rim. One of North Carolina's finest, Brad Daugherty, a future NBA all-star, is under it. But Bias, still a freshman, is too strong, too explosive. Bias soars above Daugherty, seizes the ball and buries it through the hoop in a single, smooth movement. The Washington Post journalist watching in the stands described Bias \"defying physics by hanging in the air for about three seconds, and unleashing a 20-megaton dunk that sent the overflow crowd rocking in ecstasy\". It is perhaps the most memorable moment from Bias' most memorable game. It came in February 1983, when Bias, playing for University of Maryland, took on the University of North Carolina and their own phenomenon, Jordan.  Despite being a 19-year-old in his first year on the team, Bias struck the more impressive figure, bigger and more athletic than Jordan, and a potentially more dominant force on the court.  Jordan was already a certified star. He had landed the game-winning shot when North Carolina snatched a thrilling national title win the previous year.  Bias, on the other hand, was just a freshman. But, as Maryland secured a 106-94 win, it was clear Bias was going to bring Jordan trouble.    As the era of Larry Bird versus Magic Johnson was drawing to a close, could this be the next rivalry for a new generation of basketball fans? Little did spectators know that Jordan and Bias would never get the chance to renew their rivalry on the professional stage. Leonard Kevin Bias was born on 18 November 1963 in Landover, Maryland, a small town on the outskirts of Washington DC. He was one of four siblings who all attended the same elementary school, theatre school and high school.  \"He loved creativity and could see the beauty in things that most people couldn't,\" Bias' mother, Dr Lonise Bias tells BBC Sport. \"When he was in college, he loved interior design. He had that eye for putting things together and he was always meticulous about his appearance. \"He was the type of person who strived for perfection - he didn't like stuff halfway. He liked order. As he was developing, he was able to discover the hidden abilities within him.\"  You can see the creativity when you watch him on the court; inventive methods of getting the ball into the bucket, whether that was an assist to a team-mate through the legs of an opposing player, or shifting his body in awkward positions when flying to the rim. You could see Bias' creativity spilling out on the court. Bias had a growth spurt around the age of 13. Dr Bias says it was as if he had \"grown a foot overnight\". Playing on the junior high school team, he was known as 'the human eraser' because of the way he would block shots.  He had college offers from across the United States, but opted for Maryland to stay close to his home and family. As a freshman, Bias lacked discipline, relying on his natural talent and balletic agility that had fellow students compare him to Muhammad Ali. \"You couldn't talk to Lenny in his freshman year,\" team-mate Ben Coleman said in 1984. \"Criticism or advice would go in one ear and out the other. \"But that's changed as he's gotten older,\" Coleman continued. \"Len is going to be a helluva ballplayer.\" Coleman's prediction and Bias' potential was realised. During his four years at Maryland, Bias scored a mountainous 2,149 points, a school record at the time, and twice earned All-American honours, recognising the best young players in the country. \"He had a sweet jump shot,\" says team-mate Keith Gatlin, who arrived at Maryland a year after Bias.  \"He jumped so high when he left the air people would try to get to his elbow, but couldn't because he was such a freak of nature. \"People were just in awe when they saw him because he was just a down-home, regular guy. But his talent was enormous. \"He didn't know where he was going to go, but he was just excited to play and make basketball his profession.\" Gatlin saw Bias a couple of days before he set off for New York to attend the 1986 draft at Madison Square Gardens. Both men were overwhelmed by the idea that Bias was officially going to become an NBA player. Joining the Celtics was a dream. A team flooded with talent: Larry Bird, Danny Ainge, Kevin McHale to name a few.  \"They're a good team,\" Bias said in an interview immediately after he was picked. \"I can go there and sit on the bench. Whether I play or not, I'm going to learn a lot from the players there.\" When Bias and his father made it back home to Landover, Maryland, he was met with overwhelmed hugs from family members. But his mother was not at home - she was at a work meeting.  Bias decided he would head back to his university campus to celebrate. Gatlin bumped into him as he entered the dorms.  \"He was excited and really, really blessed,\" Gatlin says. \"He just smiled at the fact now he could do something that he's been doing all his life, but get paid for it.  \"He said 'Look, I'll see you in the morning. I'm going to get ready to see my mom and dad then I'm going to go visit a girl who I haven't seen in a while, so I'll see you in the morning and we'll get some breakfast.'\"  Gatlin agreed. And that was the last time he saw him. Bias did not go to see his mom and dad or visit the girl he had not seen for a while. Instead he decided to meet up with some other friends and make a quick trip to the liquor store. They bought a six pack of beer and a bottle of cognac and headed back to the dorm room next to Gatlin's. One of the group was Brian Tribble. Although Tribble had dropped out of the University of Maryland, he still hung around campus and had bonded with Bias over a shared love of basketball and music.  It is unknown whether that night was the first time Bias had tried cocaine. Certainly, many of those closest to him had no inkling. Just before the 1986 draft his Maryland coach, Lefty Driesell, was asked what Bias was like off the court.  \"All I can tell you,\" replied Driesell, \"is that Leonard's only vice is ice cream.\" Gatlin was similarly unaware of any drug use. \"I've been out with Lenny many, many times and the thing that hurts me the most is that I never saw him touch drugs before. Never,\" says Gatlin.   \"So, to 'know' him and then to see what happened was something that I've never been able to wrap my head around. I don't think I ever will because I never saw that side of him.\" Bias consumed alcohol and cocaine deep into the night, before he decided to lie down. The other three in the room thought he had passed out from partying. A couple of minutes later he started violently twitching. Bias was having a seizure.  The 911 call was made by Tribble at 6:31am, distraught with fear and disbelief.  \"This is Len Bias. You have to get him back to life. There's no way he can die,\" Tribble, himself heavily under the influence, said to the emergency operator.  \"It doesn't matter what his name is,\" the operator replied as Tribble repeatedly brought up Bias' name. Gatlin, in the dorm next door, was woken shortly after by the phone. \"My mother called and said that she'd had a dream, and something was wrong,\" he says.  \"I said 'Wow, well I'm glad you called me, I have a math class at 8am.' She said 'Are you sure everything is OK?' I said 'Yeah, I'm going to double check on my sister too.'  \"When I went into the corridor to call my sister, I looked into the other room and saw my team-mates. I saw Lenny on the floor and that's when I knew something had gone wrong.  \"I just spoke with this person last night, and now I look down and I see him on the floor. I don't wish on anybody what I saw right there. \"I just froze. I called his mother, woke her up and told her the wrong hospital he was being taken to because I was frantic. I woke up the rest of our team-mates and we followed the ambulance to the hospital.\"  By the time his mother and father could make it to the correct hospital, Bias had already been pronounced dead. \"I did not know who Len was,\" says his mother Lonise.  \"I knew that he played basketball, that he was my son, and he was doing well. I didn't know who he was as a man.  \"It wasn't until he died that I found out who he was.  \"People around the world were grieving over the loss of this man and this was just my son that I love. I didn't know the level of popularity he had until he passed.  \"We received flowers from the president and other personal cards from the vice president of the country, from the Senate leaders, Michael Jordan sent flowers, Larry Bird, and Magic Johnson's mother called.\"  Maryland's chief medical examiner attributed Bias' death directly to cocaine. He said it had \"interrupted the normal electrical control of his heartbeat, resulting in the sudden onset of seizures and cardiac arrest\". Tribble was put on trial on charges of supplying the cocaine that night, but was found not guilty. \"I love Lenny Bias,\" he said outside the courtroom. \"I always have, always will.\" In 1990, three years later, Tribble would be convicted for 10 years for large-scale cocaine dealing. Tribble's conviction was just one of millions in the wider 'War on Drugs' that dominated the policies of successive US governments.  Between 1980 and 2009, the adult arrest rate for drug possession or use increased by 138% in the United States,, external with the majority of the rise in the first decade of that 30-year period. Bias' death, at his physical peak, with a future laid out before him, was part of the justification for harsher sentences for smaller amounts of certain drugs. \"Len Bias, he was the man - he was going to be the next superstar,\" says historian David Farber, author of War on Drugs: A History. \"I grew up in Chicago, I grew up with Michael Jordan, but there were people saying 'he's going to take Jordan'. There was fear about Bias going to the Celtics, he was that good.  \"The speaker of the House of Representatives at the time of his death was Tip O'Neill, who could see there was a mid-term election coming up in November 1986.  \"He understood a whole lot of people were terrified that this superstar athlete, this extraordinary fit young man had fallen prey to a cocaine overdose. O'Neill represented Boston, was a Celtics fan. It was really good politics for him to pay attention to the specificity of Len Bias' death.\"  O'Neill, a Democrat, realised his party could not afford to be seen as weak on an issue that was seeping into the psyche of American voters. \"Time magazine and Newsweek were outlets that middle-class Americans would read at the time. They had massive circulations at this point and had begun to pump crack as the new American nightmare,\" says Farber. \"Crack was not something whites, the middle class and suburban youths were using either. But it was a great 'what if?'. \"Bias didn't use crack, he died of a powdered cocaine overdose, but that's not what people perceived at the time.\" O'Neill was the driving force behind the Anti-Drug Abuse Act that became more draconian the more it was discussed. \"This bill started to become a bidding war around who could punish drug dealers and drug users more,\" explains Farber.  \"Usually you negotiate - Labour and Capital, they find a way to fight and compromise.  \"But on this there was no negotiation, it was like, 'Let's put them away for five years? No, let's put them away for 10 years! Let's reduce the amount of crack that puts you in jail from 100g to 50g! Actually, how about 10g?' \"Len Bias was in the centre of all of this. Here's this superhero who becomes an emblem of what drug abuse can do to the best of us.\"  In October 1986, a little over four months on from Bias' death, President Ronald Reagan signed the Anti-Drug Abuse Act into law in the White House's East Room. The act specified amounts of certain drugs that would trigger a prosecution for possession. For crack cocaine, the level was set at 5g. For powdered cocaine - the more expensive drug that had killed Bias - it was set at 500g. The minimum sentence for a conviction in either case was five years without parole. It also set a minimum 20-year sentence for anyone convicted of dealing drugs that caused death or serious injury. \"This legislation is not intended as a means of filling our jails with drug users,\" Reagan told the press. But its effect was exactly that. In 1986, the US prison population stood at 522,064. Ten years later, it was more than 1.1 million., external \"It just started to take young people and throwing them into prison in massive numbers,\" says Farber. \"Poor communities - in particular poor black communities - were hit really hard. Crack was a drug that was tailor-made for poor people because it was cheap, it created a really strong and immediate high, and it was reproducible again and again.  \"In the United States, we talk about a carceral state, a state built around putting people in prison and that starts with the crack-cocaine hysteria.\"  Bias' death prompted two questions. One has been a source of fascination to basketball fans: what if he had a chance to play in the NBA? The second spread fear throughout America: what if this happens to our children?  Len's mother, Lonise, would be entitled to more. Less than five years after the loss of Len, his younger brother Jay was killed in a drive-by shooting. However, she has found meaning amid the starkest adversity.  \"My strength has been my faith,\" she says. \"The heartache of losing a child is a hundred times worse than a parent can imagine. My belief system and my faith in Jesus Christ is how I have made it.  \"For me, Len and Jay were two seeds that went down into the ground to bring forth life. They weren't buried, they were planted, to bring new information and insight to another generation and encouragement to those that need it.\" Dr Bias now speaks around the world about healing, self-discovery and the power of community. And when she thinks the last time she saw Len in person and in life - the day before he travelled to New York for the draft - she remembers only his enthusiasm.  \"He was excited, excited, excited,\" she says. Excited for a future cut so cruelly short."

I am going to be racing for quite some time still so it is good [Alonso] is still around,\" Hamilton said. \"Fernando is one of the best drivers we've had in the sport so for him to continue to be here and continue to have the output he's had just shows what is possible. And shows the new era of athlete, what the human body can do and continue to do if you nurture it.\" How to follow the Chinese Grand Prix F1 Q&A: Ricciardo, Albon, Alonso & Chinese Grand Prix Speaking before this weekend's Chinese Grand Prix, the seven-time champion added: \"I never thought I would be racing into my 40s. I'm pretty sure I said I wouldn't. But life is such a crazy trip. I don't feel 40. I generally feel great.\" McLaren driver Lando Norris said Alonso's achievements in competing for so long at the highest level in Formula 1 might never be seen again. Norris said: \"He is one of the oldest guys competing at the top in any sport.  \"And to be able to do that at the level he has done and continues to do, you could potentially never see that again in F1. And if you do, it is going to be extremely rare.\" Norris, who races for McLaren, said he had \"a lot of respect\" for Alonso's ability to continue to perform at the highest level for so long. \"It takes a lot of dedication,\" the 24-year-old Briton said. \"I don't think anyone thinks Fernando lacks that in any way. He shows that in every part of his life. It is rare that you see someone commit for so long in any sport.\" Frenchman Esteban Ocon, who was Alonso's team-mate at Alpine in 2021 and 2022, said: \"His dedication is an example for all of us.\" Alonso's commitment to and longevity in F1 is setting a new standard - he will be the first driver to race at the top level into his mid-40s since three-time world champion Jack Brabham, who scored his final win aged 44 in 1970. Two-time champion Graham Hill continued in F1 until he was 46 in 1975, although - unlike Alonso - he was considered to be well past his best in the final stages of his career. The Chinese Grand Prix returns to the calendar for the first time since 2019, after a break for the pandemic, China's handling of the disease and the effects of Covid lockdowns in the country. It also marks the first 'sprint' weekend of the new season, being run to a slightly different format than last year. This season, the new approach is to have qualifying for the 'sprint' event on Friday afternoon. The 'sprint' - a shorter race about one-third the distance of a grand prix - runs on Saturday morning, at 04:00 UK time (11:00 local in Shanghai).  This is followed by qualifying for the grand prix on Saturday afternoon before the main race as normal on Sunday. World champion Max Verstappen said the new format \"makes more sense\" than last year's, when the sprint events were separated out on the Saturday and qualifying for the grand prix was on Friday. Another rule change this year allows teams to change their cars after the sprint if they are unhappy with the set-up."

        "text": " Red Bull's Max Verstappen fought off a challenge from Ferrari driver Carlos Sainz to take pole position for the Australian Grand Prix.  Sainz was quickest in the first two parts of qualifying but the world champion bounced back in the top 10 shootout to take pole by 0.27 seconds. Lando Norris will start third ahead of Ferrari's Charles Leclerc after a grid penalty for Red Bull's Sergio Perez. Mercedes' George Russell was seventh while Lewis Hamilton only 11th. No transparency and accountability in F1 - Hamilton Wolff takes legal action after conflict of interest inquiry How to follow the Australian Grand Prix on the BBC Norris' team-mate Oscar Piastri made it a four-six for McLaren while RB's Yuki Tsunoda and the Aston Martins of Lance Stroll and Fernando Alonso completed the top 10. Verstappen and Red Bull had looked comparatively out of sorts for most of the weekend, there or thereabouts but not topping any of the practice sessions on the way to qualifying. And when Sainz was fastest in both first and second qualifying, the Spaniard looked a favourite for pole, just 15 days after having an operation for appendicitis that forced him to miss the Saudi Arabian Grand Prix. But two exquisite laps from Verstappen in the final session were too good for the Ferraris and the Dutchman took his third pole position in a row this season, one he has started in even more dominant style than his record-breaking 2023. \"A bit unexpected in qualifying today but very happy with Q3,\" Verstappen said. \"Both of those laps felt very nice. Bit of a tricky weekend but we managed to be there at the end.\" Red Bull typically have an even greater advantage in the race than in qualifying but Ferrari's long run in second practice looked strong and Verstappen said he was expecting a challenge in the race. \"They seem very quick also in the long runs so a bit of a question mark also for tomorrow but that makes it interesting,\" he said. It was a momentous performance from Sainz, in remarkable form considering he was just two weeks out from abdominal surgery. He said: \"It has ben a tough couple of weeks, a lot of days in bed, waiting to see if I could be here today. To make it this weekend and put it on the front row after leading all the way through qualifying, I almost could not believe it.  \"Very happy to be here. I was a bit rusty yesterday but I got up to speed and feeling good with the car. \"I am not going to lie, I am not in my most comfortable state when I am driving out there but I can get it done. A lot of discomfort and weird feelings but no pain so it allowed me to push flat out.\" Perez took third in qualifying, 0.359secs slower than team-mate Verstappen, but was later given a three-place grid drop for impeding the Haas of Nico Hulkenberg in the first part of qualifying. Leclerc had looked competitive on Friday but he said he felt the car had gone away from him on Saturday, developing understeer, and he had a \"messy\" qualifying as a result, adding too much front wing for the final run and generating oversteer instead. Norris' fourth place was McLaren's best result of a year after they have started a little bit behind where they expected to be. Mercedes, meanwhile, continued to struggle in Australia after a difficult weekend in Saudi Arabia last time out. Lacking pace in the high-speed corners in Jeddah, the team have spent the time between the two races trying to understand why their car was not behaving as expected. But little progress appears to have been made. Last year, Russell was on the front row with Verstappen, but this time he was more than 0.8secs off the pace. And Hamilton did not even make it into the top 10, losing out to his team-mate in the second session by 0.059secs. Both drivers insist the car has potential, but after three races it remains stubbornly elusive and Mercedes still have plenty of work to do.

        "text": " Lando Norris confirmed his elevation into Formula 1's elite with an exceptional drive to second place in the Chinese Grand Prix. The winner was inevitable - Max Verstappen's Red Bull was out of touch of everyone else as usual. But Norris was the class of the rest of the field in his McLaren. It more than made up for his mistake at the start of the sprint race on Saturday, which threw away the advantage he had gained through an outstanding performance in qualifying to take sprint pole position by more than a second in the wet. Norris tried to sit it out around the outside of the first corner with Lewis Hamilton's Mercedes after the seven-time champion made a better start, but succeeded only in sliding off the track and down to seventh place. Verstappen wins in China with Norris second  How Chinese GP unfolded Andrew Benson Q&A: Send us your questions  Norris being Norris, he was still beating himself up about that - in a humorous way - even after holding off Verstappen's team-mate Sergio Perez to seal the runner-up spot in the main grand prix. \"I didn't make a mistake in Turn One and go off,\" he said, with a smile. \"It's a good start. And got past the Aston [Martin of Fernando Alonso] and then you can just control the race. And that was very different to yesterday.\" He added: \"Whenever I finish behind Max, I feel like it's a win. A great day, really a surprise, was not expecting a day like today. So very happy for myself and for the whole team, more importantly. Definitely exceeded our expectations but a lot of things went our way.\" This is Norris in a nutshell. He is not one to big himself up. His natural persona tends to look for the negatives, ways to improve.  So it was in keeping with that approach that he had bet his engineers that he would finish the grand prix 35 seconds behind the Ferrari of Charles Leclerc, despite the Monegasque starting in seventh place, three places behind Norris. \"Happy to be wrong with myself,\" Norris said afterwards. Norris' day turned on the two safety cars mid-race. Before that, he was in a battle with Leclerc for third place behind the two Red Bulls, and it looked as if Norris on a two-stop strategy would be chasing down Leclerc on one-stop in the closing laps. Leclerc did not have the pace to catch Norris in the first stint on medium tyres, but he was doing a good job of looking after them and so Ferrari decided to extend to give them a shot at a podium. But the timing of the caution periods forced Perez to make a second pit stop, and put Norris also on a one-stop. The Mexican dropped behind both Norris and Leclerc. What was impressive about Norris' race from then on was that, after passing Leclerc within seven laps, Perez could not catch the McLaren. In fact, Norris was faster. Again being modest, Norris put that down to Perez having probably overworked his tyres in passing Leclerc. But that would be to diminish his own achievement. This was a Red Bull, after all, a car that looks poised to challenge last year's achievements, when the team and Verstappen produced the most dominant season in F1 history. McLaren Formula E driver Sam Bird, working with BBC Sport as co-commentator on 5 live, noticed that Norris had been employing clever driving to maximise his tyre life. At the end of the long, long Turn One into Turn Two combination, Norris was slowing the car at the apex of Turn Two, and taking a much shallower, straighter exit, in contrast to the sweeping, wider normal line.  This might be slower through the middle of the corner, but it saves a lot of tyre energy. Over 50-odd laps, this sort of clever driving pays dividends, as Norris' pace in the late part of the race demonstrated. McLaren team principal Andrea Stella identified this as one of the steps Norris has made towards completeness from last year to this. \"In the race,\" Stella said, \"he seems to be become more and more consistent and more and more capable of understanding what is going on, what is going on with the tyres, which axle is going, how long can the tyres go.  \"What we call the race-craft seems to be becoming larger and larger and more and more accurate.\" Stella said Norris and the team had worked hard over the winter on identifying weaknesses in his game last year - such as a propensity for making errors in qualifying - and tried to iron them out for 2024. \"What Lando had done this year,\" Stella said after the race, \"he has been able to capitalise on a lot of points and opportunities that we identified last year. For instance, one is qualifying performance: how do you put together clean laps in qualifying?  \"Last year, he was quick but we have had several situations like in Qatar when he could have been on pole position but he had both laps in Q3 deleted. There was a lot to take from there and from other situations. \"So he has done a really good job on working on the opportunities together with his engineers and the support of the factory to make some small adaptations to be able top exploit the potential of the car to a greater extent. This is credit to him.\" The result is a driver becoming a complete performer, and everyone in the paddock now recognises him as being part of the elite group also featuring Verstappen, Hamilton, Alonso and Leclerc. Norris was asked by Nico Rosberg on Sky television after the race whether he felt he was driving as well as anyone in F1 and whether a long-awaited win might be coming. \"I feel like it, but that's F1,\" he said. \"Max is doing a good job, Red Bull are doing an amazing job. I can't fault them and I can't be too annoyed at that.  \"I feel like I am getting a lot out of the car, especially on Sundays. So I have to be happy with the job I'm doing and one day, I think it's coming. I am not overconfident in saying it. I think we can get a win this year. It is going to be difficult, we have a lot of work to do but we're working hard.\" A win against Red Bull is going to require an upgrade to the McLaren car and some luck. A first significant upgrade is coming - at the next race in Miami - but the team do not expect it to make them winners on its own.  Stella said: \"I have a lot of admiration for what Red Bull are achieving. Winning so consistently is not easy. There are so many reasons things can go wrong even if they make it look easy. Even if it looks ordinary, it's not. We do look at how they do things. But my thoughts are, how do we get there?\" Stella pointed out accurately that McLaren have made more progress more than any other team over the last 12 months - but then after a weak start to last year, they had a lot of room for improvement. He also said that they, like everyone else, were suffering from the major step forward Red Bull had made with this year's car, after stopping developing last year's dominant model early to focus on 2024. \"We lost some ground because we gained so much ground before while they were not developing,\" Stella said. \"That's why we have to look at things over the long period and over that long period we are on a strong trajectory.  \"If we keep this strong trajectory for the next 12 months, why not? We may reach Red Bull.\""

        "text": " The woman who complained about Red Bull team principal Christian Horner's behaviour is \"very upset, angry, scared, intimidated and lonely\", a family friend has told BBC Sport. The woman lodged a complaint in December that contained allegations of coercive, abusive behaviour and sexual harassment by Horner. She \"struggles to understand\" how Red Bull dismissed the complaint following an investigation, the friend added. Horner has always denied the claims. Red Bull dismissed the complaint on 28 February after an internal investigation and cleared Horner, 50, of any wrongdoing. Until now, the complaint has been described as one of inappropriate and controlling behaviour. Red Bull said they could not confirm it also included allegations of sexual harassment, but BBC Sport has seen evidence to that effect. The woman is unable to talk about her claims, having signed a legal undertaking not to discuss the matter with anyone other than her father and brother, the friend said. \"It's impossible for people to understand what it's like for her,\" said the friend, who was talking to BBC Sport exclusively and on condition of anonymity. \"She can't talk and she won't talk. \"But I can tell you what it is doing to her. Every time I have asked her something, she breaks down in tears and says she's got no-one to talk to because she's not allowed to talk. \"She is very upset, very angry, very scared, very intimidated, very lonely. And I think it's impossible for people to understand without being in her shoes what it's like for her.\" A Red Bull spokesperson said: \"Both [parties] signed a confidentiality agreement on it so they both can't discuss it.\" The day after the complaint was dismissed, a cache of messages purporting to involve Horner was leaked to nearly 150 senior F1 personnel and media. The following week, the complainant was suspended by Red Bull. BBC Sport has previously reported that the reason given to the woman by Red Bull was she had been dishonest. Horner has described the leak as \"anonymous, speculative messages from an unknown source\" and refused to comment on its contents. BBC Sport has not verified whether the messages are genuine, and attempts in early March to ask Horner to confirm it were shut down by a Red Bull PR handler.  However, the friend claimed the messages were a genuine exchange between Horner and the complainant. The friend said: \"We can all read the WhatsApps and anybody can come to their own conclusion whether that was an appropriate relationship between a CEO and a PA. \"As Christian has said, he wants to draw a line under this. Well, if this has been a fair and independent process and there has been no wrongdoing found, then why isn't that being brought forward in a transparent way and why isn't Christian denying that those WhatsApps are real? \"I do feel like you had some people who feel it takes two to tango, but that's unfair. That is trying to divert. The issue here is, should Christian have done what he did as a CEO?\" Red Bull have said they cannot comment further on the report and its findings because of confidentiality issues regarding employment law. The friend said the woman has been badly hit by Red Bull's response to her complaint. \"She struggles to understand how, given the information, an independent process can have come to the conclusions it has, and the actions that have followed,\" her friend said. \"It's shocking but not surprising how upset she is. There have been multiple financial offers [to sell her story], none of which she has had any interest in even engaging on. \"The fact she can't talk to her friends, is only allowed to talk to her direct family members\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 you have a single female who has followed the right process and feels like she is unheard and it has been a totally unjust process. \"It takes a pretty brave woman to do what she has done. And unfortunately it is a very poor state of affairs.\" The complainant has appealed against Red Bull's decision and has made F1's governing body the FIA aware of the situation and asked it to investigate. The friend added: \"It is registered to go to an employment tribunal, which is public. As a friend, I can tell you I would assume that Horner, like he has done every step of the way, will do everything he can to make sure that the employee tribunal is not public. \"Unfortunately, the date is a long time away. She has been threatened with legalese every step of the way, as has the media. \"She has now been suspended and it's clear that's Red Bull following a process to eventually fire her.\" A Red Bull spokesperson said: \"Christian has not made attempts to [make sure the employment tribunal is private]. And she has not been suspended with the intent of firing her.\" The friend said the woman would keep pursuing her case. \"She is determined for the truth to come out,\" they said. \"She just wants to work in the sport and is very concerned about her reputation and ability to get hired by anyone. \"She has been in motorsport her entire life, so on one hand she is very concerned and scared for her future, on the other hand very determined for the truth to come out. \"Because she can't talk to her friends openly, I think she has all this bottled-up fear and concern that she is not able to openly communicate with her friends and family to support her and give her advice, because she is being respectful of the terms and conditions that have been placed upon her. \"It's pretty clear she has not been able to say a word or even identify herself and yet Christian is able to give enough commentary because he has got a position of power and influence to effectively give his side of the story and she has been completely muted.\" Do the Germans always win?

        "text": " Fernando Alonso's passion for Formula 1 shone like a blinding light as he announced his decision to race on with Aston Martin until at least the end of 2026. The Spanish two-time world champion will be 43 in July, and his new contract will mean he will be racing in F1 until at least the age of 45. Alonso is rewriting the sport's rule book, and the remarkable thing about it is that he does not even seem to consider it extraordinary. \"I felt I love too much driving that I cannot stop at the moment,\" said Alonso. \"The sacrifices you have to make are smaller than the passion I have for driving. \"I breathe F1, I live for F1, I train to be fit to drive F1, I eat to be fit to drive F1. It didn't arrive the moment I felt the need to change lifestyle. I love what I do. I will not be happy sitting at home watching F1 because at the moment I still feel I should be there.\" On the performance front, there can be little doubt about that. Alonso was one of the outstanding performers of last season, as Aston Martin made a remarkable leap from the middle of the pack to the front at the start of the year. Six podiums in the first eight races followed, including some outstanding drives. And although the team's performance level dropped in the second part of the season, Alonso's did not.  His drive to third in Brazil at the end of the season, holding off Sergio Perez's Red Bull for 16 laps and then re-passing it on the final lap after the Mexican had finally got by, was a masterpiece. Alonso has made great play so far this season of saying he wanted to spend some time working out whether he wanted to carry on racing before deciding where to do that if the answer was yes. It has not taken that long. Retirement, he added, \"never went to my mind\". Alonso said he decided after the third race of the season in Australia that he wanted to keep going. After that, staying with Aston Martin was the \"natural decision and the logical thing to do\". Aston Martin had offered him a new contract even before they had arrived in Melbourne. It did what Alonso wanted - offered him a long-term commitment, with a tidy salary, that underlined their commitment to him as a driver.  After a season like Alonso had in 2023, when he was arguably the second most impressive driver of the year after world champion Max Verstappen, they did not need any more convincing. And it provided Alonso the backing he had not felt at Alpine, a management failure which led to his decision to leave the French team and join Aston in the first place back in the summer of 2022. The driver market is in flux at the moment, following Lewis Hamilton's decision to move to Ferrari, and the internal ructions at Red Bull caused by allegations about team principal Christian Horner's behaviour towards a female colleague. Alonso had spoken to other teams, he admitted. He would not name them, but it's no secret he meant Red Bull and Mercedes.  But, as he had said he would just a few weeks ago, Alonso made his own decision in his own time, not waiting for, or being rushed, by others.  \"I felt the most wanted in Aston Martin,\" said Alonso. \"The other conversations were just light and maybe more time was needed, whereas in Aston there was a clear desire to work together and it was the same I had.\" He said the new contract was \"the longest project I ever signed - it will keep me linked with Aston for many years to come. Let's see how long I keep driving.\" Time was when it was felt that the late 30s were as long as a driver could go before he lost his edge. Now, Alonso will still be out there in his mid-40s, something that has not happened for a top driver since five-time world champion Juan Manuel Fangio in the 1950s. \"Yes, it is true,\" he added. \"I will be 45 and keep racing. If one day I feel not motivated, or feel I'm not fast, or not sharp, I have a relationship with Aston very honest and I will be the first one to raise my hand and say, 'I have maybe lost here or there', and we will find solutions.  \"I don't see that coming for the next few years.\" As evidence, he reiterated the point he made after Sunday's Japanese Grand Prix that it was \"one of my best races ever\". And it took place five days ago. Alonso even found time for a joke about the constant questions about his age as he added: \"Lewis will have 40 years in January so maybe I will not be the only one 40-plus you will be talking about.\" The decision whether to stay in F1, he said, was more about whether he could still put up with the second-order aspects outside racing that he has never enjoyed. \"It was not the racing,\" Alonso said. \"Looking at the calendar, I was a little bit afraid that this would be heavy for me. There are all the commitments pre-season with the photo-shoots, car launch, all these things are quite demanding for drivers in general and. for me, in particular at this time in my career. \"So I said, 'Let me go through that tough period as I call it, of marketing and media and things like that, and then that tough period of travelling and time zones and big plane (flights). If I feel I am not enjoying what I am doing, it is better to not keep racing. If I go through that and I love racing and all the rest is not heavy on me, I want to continue. Why not?' \"That was the first thing I wanted to clarify with myself.\" After that, Aston Martin's relative competitiveness, its steady stream of upgrades so far this season, continuing growth as a team - with a new wind tunnel at their new factory coming on stream later this year - and the prospect of working again with Honda when the Japanese company becomes their engine partner in 2026, were enough to convince him it was the right place to be. \"My biggest concern or the bad side of driving was missing my family and not having a normal life or my own family at one point or whatever,\" added Alonso. \"But in this regard I said, 'OK, let's see year by year, month by month'. \"I spoke with my family. They will come more often to races. All of them are coming to Miami [in early May] now, my mother, my sister and my two nieces.   \"We decide and plan to make some changes for the things I miss or the things that maybe worry me about keeping racing. \"F1 takes all your time. You have to give up everything in life for racing and I wanted to speak with myself to make sure I wanted to do so.  \"Once I had done that, I sat with Aston and it was not too difficult. We both wanted the same, I wanted to keep racing with Aston Martin and they wanted to keep me, and when two parties want something at one point you reach an agreement. \"I am extremely excited to keep racing. I feel at home. It was also a sense of loyalty that I wanted to express to my team [who I joined] one year and half ago.  \"We started together and we achieved so many things, so many highs in such a short period of time and I thought this was just the beginning.\""

        "text": " The Australian Grand Prix will return to its traditional position as the first race of the new season in 2025. Melbourne, which will host the race weekend from 14-16 March, had held the first race virtually every year since it made its debut in 1996. But it has not done so since 2019 after the Covid-19 pandemic led to Bahrain taking over. The timing of the holy month of Ramadan means the races in Bahrain and Saudi Arabia have had to be delayed in 2025. Melbourne will be followed by races in China and Japan before the two events in the Middle East. This is the first of four times when Melbourne is contractually guaranteed to host the opening race until 2032.  The 2025 calendar features the same 24 races as this year's record-breaking season, in a very similar order other than the opening events. The British Grand Prix at Silverstone will be on 4-6 July and the season will end in Abu Dhabi on 5-7 December. F1 chairman and chief executive officer Stefano Domenicali, whose responsibility it is to organise the calendar, said: \"2025 will be a special year as we celebrate the 75th anniversary of the FIA Formula 1 World Championship, and it's that legacy and experience that allows us to deliver such a strong calendar.  \"Once again, we'll visit 24 incredible venues around the world, delivering top class racing, hospitality, and entertainment, which will be enjoyed by millions of fans worldwide.\" 14-16 March Australia 21-23 March China 4-6 April Japan 11-13 April Bahrain 18-20 April Saudi Arabia 2-4 May Miami 16-18 May Emilia-Romagna 23-25 May Monaco 30 May-1 June Spain 13-15 June Canada 27-29 June Austria 4-6 July United Kingdom 25-27 July Belgium 1-3 August Hungary 29-31 August Netherlands 5-7 September Italy 19-21 September Azerbaijan 3-5 October Singapore 17-19 October United States (Austin) 24-26 October Mexico 7-9 November Sao Paulo 20-22 November United States (Las Vegas) 28-30 November Qatar 5-7 December Abu Dhabi "

        "text": " The woman in the Christian Horner controversy has lodged an official complaint about his behaviour with Formula 1's governing body, the FIA. BBC Sport has learned the complainant, who accused Red Bull's team principal of inappropriate behaviour, has registered a grievance with the FIA's ethics committee. Horner, 50, has always denied the accusations made against him. The woman's actions follow two previous whistleblower complaints registered with the FIA in the past few weeks. BBC Sport has learned that one was made to the FIA ethics and compliance hotline on 2 February, and made direct reference to Horner's behaviour towards a female employee, asked the FIA to look into it, and expressed a fear that Red Bull could try to cover it up. The second complaint on 6 March referenced the first and warned that the whistleblower would next inform the media. In a statement, the FIA said: \"Enquiries and complaints are received and managed by the compliance officer, and the ethics committee where appropriate. \"Both bodies operate autonomously, guaranteeing strict confidentiality throughout the process. \"As a consequence, and in general, we are unable to confirm the receipt of any specific complaint and it is unlikely that we will be able to provide further comment on the complaints that we may receive from any parties.\" A Red Bull Racing spokesperson said it was not aware of the complaint and did not want to comment further. The official complaint made by the woman to the FIA follows her decision to appeal against Red Bull's dismissal of her complaint. Red Bull's decision was made after an investigation conducted by a lawyer. Last week, Red Bull suspended her from her role with the team. The accusations against Horner came to light in early February, but the investigation into his behaviour had started almost a month before. It lasted 10 weeks, according to Red Bull. Red Bull appointed an external lawyer to investigate the claims. After his report was submitted to the company's board, it decided to dismiss the complaint. The following day, a cache of messages purporting to involve Horner was leaked to nearly 150 senior F1 insiders and media. Horner has said it is \"time to draw a line under\" the controversy. Red Bull has refused to give further details of the case, citing confidentiality. BBC Sport has previously reported that the reason given by Red Bull to the employee was that she had been dishonest. Horner said at last weekend's Saudi Arabian Grand Prix: \"The reality is that there was a grievance raised, it was dealt with in the most professional manner by the group, that appointed an independent KC, one of the most reputable in the land. \"He took time to investigate all the facts. He looked at everything and he came to a conclusion where he dismissed the grievance.  \"As far as I'm concerned, as far as Red Bull is concerned, we move on.\" The controversy is at the centre of a power struggle inside Red Bull, involving Horner, the motorsport adviser Helmut Marko, the team's three-time world champion Max Verstappen and his father Jos, Verstappen's manager Raymond Vermeulen and the two owners of the company. Last weekend, an intervention by Max Verstappen was instrumental in keeping Marko from being dismissed.  Chalerm Yoovidhya, the 51% shareholder, has backed Horner and forced 49% shareholders Red Bull Gmbh in Austria to back down in wanting to force him out.

        "text": " Four-time world champion Sebastian Vettel says he has been thinking about coming out of retirement but it is not his \"number one priority\". The 36-year-old German, who won consecutive titles for Red Bull between 2010 and 2013, retired in 2022. With Lewis Hamilton moving to Ferrari, Mercedes has a vacant seat in 2025 and Vettel is aware of the F1 landscape. \"I'm having thoughts that are crossing my mind and thinking about [a return],\" Vettel told BBC Radio 5 Live. \"But at this stage, my mindset generally hasn't changed so it really depends on what's coming up.\" Asked specifically about Mercedes, Vettel added: \"I'm following the sport and at the minute there's quite a lot of movement when it comes to drivers, driver market and so on. \"I'm obviously in contact with a lot of people still. I'm speaking as well to Toto [Wolff] every now and then. \"It depends I guess but at the minute it's not the number one priority.\" Watch: Sebastian Vettel: 'I'm thinking about returning to F1' Verstappen expected to dominate Japanese Grand Prix Hamilton and his Mercedes team-mate George Russell both gave their approval for Vettel's potential return. \"I would love for Seb to come back and I think he would be an amazing option for the team,\" Hamilton told a news conference at the Suzuka Circuit before the Japanese Grand Prix. Fellow Briton Russell added: \"Sebastian's a great person. For sure, his personality is missed on the grid.  \"I'm really happy and open to have anybody as my team-mate, whether it's a world champion or a rookie, it doesn't change how I go about my business.\" Vettel raced for Red Bull from 2009 to 2014, where he worked with team principal Christian Horner. In February, Horner was cleared by an internal investigation into his behaviour towards a female colleague. Allegations of inappropriate and controlling behaviour had been made against the 50-year-old, who denies wrongdoing. Vettel acknowledged he was still in contact with Horner but \"doesn't know what did happen and didn't happen\" and \"you never know what source to trust\" with correspondence between the pair kept to sporting matters. He said: \"There were two races at the beginning of the season and they did great so I sent him [Horner] a message and congratulated [him], like other people in the team as well. \"From a sporting point of view, the team is doing amazing.\" Vettel said he is uncertain what the future holds for world champion Max Verstappen at Red Bull and did not rule out him leaving the team. Verstappen said last month his father Jos was \"not a liar\" after the latter's claim that the controversy around Horner was \"driving people apart\". The 26-year-old Dutchman dismissed claims in the media that he could be tempted to leave Red Bull for Mercedes in the wake of the Horner controversy. \"So many things happened in the last couple of months. I didn't think there was any chance Lewis [Hamilton] leaves Mercedes and we were all taught wrong,\" Vettel added. \"Exciting for the sport that he [Hamilton] does and as for what Max is doing you'd have to ask him, but it seems like anything can happen.\" Vettel also said it was \"exciting\" that F1 has worked to develop a synthetic sustainable fuel to be introduced in 2026, as part of its programme to be net-zero carbon by 2030, but it was long overdue. He said: \"I think it's important we demonstrate there are solutions and there are options we can take, alternatives, because you cannot hover around on based on fossil fuels forever. \"I felt it's a bit late because the technology has been around for way longer, but anyway here it is so it's good to do that step finally and it's an absolute must.\""

        "text": " Fernando Alonso has signed to stay with Aston Martin in Formula 1 for at least the next two seasons. Alonso, 42, who was out of contract at the end of this season, has a new deal that will extend until at least the end of 2026, Aston Martin said. It means Alonso will be driving in F1 at least until he is 45, and possibly beyond. He said retirement \"never went to my mind\", adding: \"I felt I love driving too much to stop at the moment.\" Staying at Aston Martin was a \"natural decision\", once Alonso had made up his mind that he was prepared to make the life sacrifices that would be required by staying in F1.  Team principal Mike Krack says the two-time world champion \"is hungry for success, driving better than ever, is fitter than ever\". \"He is completely dedicated to making Aston Martin a competitive force,\" Krack said. \"Securing Fernando's long-term future with Aston Martin is fantastic news. We have built a strong working relationship over the last 18 months and we share the same determination to see this project succeed. \"We have been in constant dialogue over the last few months and Fernando has been true to his word: when he decided he wanted to continue racing, he talked to us first. Fernando has shown he believes in us, and we believe in him.\" The decision takes Alonso out of the equation for potential seats at Red Bull and Mercedes next season. Alonso said he had talked to other teams, but added: \"I felt the most wanted in Aston Martin. The other conversations were just light and maybe more time was needed, whereas in Aston there was a clear desire to work together and it was the same I had.\" Alonso joined Aston Martin at the start of the 2023 season and the pairing became one of the star attractions of last year. Aston Martin made a remarkable leap to the front, and not only was Alonso able to return to the podium for the first time since 2013, but he also scored podiums in six of the first eight races. He was widely regarded as one of the outstanding performers of the 2023 season, with a series of impressive drives before the team slipped from competitiveness. Had the team made the right choice of tyres in a late-race rain shower, he would have beaten world champion Max Verstappen's Red Bull to victory in Monaco. The driver market is in flux this season following Lewis Hamilton's move from Mercedes to Ferrari for 2025 and amid unrest at Red Bull, because of the controversy over allegations about team principal Christian Horner's behaviour towards a female employee. Horner has denied any wrongdoing. Alonso was of interest to both teams, so choosing to stay at Aston Martin is a big vote of confidence in the team as they seek to move towards the front of the grid. It also buries claims that Honda's role with Aston could be a problem for Alonso, who upset the Japanese manufacturer with some public complaints about their engine when they were working together at McLaren from 2015-17.

        "text": " Toto Wolff has again discussed the prospect of signing Max Verstappen for next season, saying \"everyone is waiting to see what he is going to do\". But Red Bull team principal Christian Horner criticised Wolff, asking why the Dutch driver would leave his team to drive for struggling Mercedes. Wolff said: \"There are so many factors that play a role for a driver joining. \"Clearly, from the most rational point of view, that's the quickest car in the hands of the quickest driver,\" he said.  \"But I don't think this is the only reason you stay where you are.\" Verstappen wins in China with Norris second  How Chinese Grand Prix unfolded  Andrew Benson Q&A: Send us your questions Wolff alluded to the ongoing controversy around allegations involving Horner, who a female employee has accused of sexual harassment and controlling behaviour. Horner has always denied the allegations. An internal Red Bull inquiry cleared the 50-year-old in February, but the woman has appealed and a second internal inquiry is under way. She has also lodged her case with a UK employment tribunal, which is expected to hear her complaint next year. Wolff said: \"For simple minds, [performance] might be the only reason you stay in a car. But maybe there is more depth to some people that considers other factors, too, and Max has more depth.  \"In that respect, are we able to convince him? It is not a matter of convincing.  \"Max knows motor racing better than anyone and he will take decisions that he feels are good for him. A few factors play a role but he's the one who is going to trigger some more domino stones to fall afterwards, but everyone is waiting to see what he is going to do.\" Wolff said Verstappen and his management team - comprising his father, the ex-F1 driver Jos Verstappen and manager Raymond Vermeulen - would decide on his future based on a holistic view of the situation, and said the chassis and engine regulation changes for 2026 would also be a factor. \"It is a question of how they feel the future, how they feel where the future is best for them, considering a lot of factors,\" Wolff said.  \"We are in a very good position for 2026. We are ambitious with the targets we set ourselves for the power units, batteries and fuel and if we are able to produce a decent chassis, we are a good-value proposition, but who knows.\" But after another difficult race for Mercedes, in which George Russell and Lewis Hamilton finished sixth and ninth, Horner was dismissive of Wolff's comments. He said Verstappen, who is contracted to Red Bull to the end of 2028, was unavailable, adding: \"Why would you want to leave this team? Mercedes are third team behind their customers [McLaren and Aston Martin]. His time would be better spent perhaps focusing on the team rather than the driver market. \"I can assure you that there is no ambiguity about where Max Verstappen will be next year.\" Asked about his future in Shanghai on Thursday, Verstappen said: \"I signed a long-term deal with the team. The only thing I said from the beginning is we want to have a peaceful environment. Lately we have been talking about the car. I am happy about that. I am happy with the team and there has never been a reason to leave.\""

        "text": " Mercedes have signed former Ferrari designer Simone Resta as their new strategic development director. The recruitment of the 53-year-old is a key part of Mercedes' restructuring process as they seek to return to competitiveness. Resta previously worked with the team's technical director James Allison when the Briton was at Ferrari from 2013-16. The Italian will join eight-time constructors' champions Mercedes at an unspecified date in 2025.  In addition, Enrico Sampo will also join the Silver Arrows from Ferrari to become head of performance software applications. Mercedes have also moved to replace performance director Loic Serra, who was poached by Ferrari last year. David Nelson has been appointed internally to that position. F1 Q&A: Your questions answered before the Australian Grand Prix  Resta was made Ferrari chief designer in 2014 under Allison, who was then the Italian team's technical director, by then chairman Sergio Marchionne. He was in that role when Ferrari created their 2017 and 2018 cars, the most competitive F1 designs to have come out of Maranello in the past decade. Both started the season as the fastest car in F1 and Sebastian Vettel led both championships for much of each season, before the team's campaigns collapsed late in both seasons as a consequence of reliability problems and errors from both team and Vettel. Resta then moved to Sauber in May 2018, returning to Ferrari in August 2019 and then joined Ferrari-affiliated Haas for 2021, where he stayed until the departure of team principal Guenther Steiner over last winter. The moves come as Mercedes continue to struggle for competitiveness under the technical rules introduced into F1 in 2022, since when Red Bull have dominated. And they are aimed at ensuring the team who won eight consecutive constructors' titles from 2014-21 are in a strong position for the new technical regulations that will come into force from 2026. These include revised power-units, with the hybrid part of the engine increasing its proportion of the total output to close to 50%, as well as major changes to the aerodynamic rules.

        "text": " Lando Norris beat Lewis Hamilton to take pole position for the sprint race at the Chinese Grand Prix in a hectic wet session. The McLaren driver had his fastest lap time deleted and then reinstated in the final minutes of the session as he beat Hamilton by 1.261 seconds. Hamilton's Mercedes headed Fernando Alonso's Aston Martin by 0.714 seconds as Max Verstappen managed only fourth. The Red Bull driver made errors on two laps before sneaking in at the end. How to follow the Chinese Grand Prix F1 Q&A: Ricciardo, Albon, Alonso & Chinese Grand Prix How Chinese GP sprint qualifying unfolded Red Bull's Sergio Perez in sixth split the Ferraris of Carlos Sainz and Charles Leclerc, who took seventh despite a crash on his first lap that required a pit stop to replace a damaged front wing and left him with bent steering. McLaren's Oscar Piastri was eighth ahead of the Sauber of Valtteri Bottas and, delighting his home fans, Zhou Guanyu. Norris said: \"I got a bit nervous. They were conditions where you have to risk a lot and push. I was quick but I kept catching the Ferrari and had to keep backing off.  \"I got a good final lap and it was enough for pole. Sad it's not a proper qualifying but good enough. \"To end up on top is exactly what we wanted and it's a nice surprise. \"Good day, tricky conditions, always nice to do it like this. Tough, especially with the rain in Q3. Conditions I've always loved and always done relatively well in.\" The sprint race will take place at 04:00 UK time on Saturday in a tweak to the scheduling of these weekends for this season. Norris added: \"The pace is good whether it's wet or dry. The car is feeling good and so am I, and it's paying off. \"Even in the dry we were pretty good. I don't think we maybe have the pace of the Red Bull in outright conditions, especially in the dry, but in the wet surprisingly very quick. I could get good tyre temps and push hard.\" Hamilton's lap was a pleasant surprise for Mercedes, who were struggling for pace in dry conditions.  The seven-time champion managed to just sneak through into the top 10 shootout in ninth place before the rain started and team-mate George Russell failed to do so in 11th place. \"Tricky conditions,\" Hamilton said. \"Not a lot of grip as you saw for everyone.  \"But so happy. As soon as I saw the rain coming, I was getting excited because in the dry conditions we're not quick enough, so when the rain came I thought I would have a better opportunity and that's when it all came alive.\" The conditions made for a helter-skelter session with drivers clearly struggling for grip on a track where F1 has not held a race for five years. Verstappen would have been expected to be on pole - the Red Bull is the fastest car and he is usually so impressive in the wet. But he mad errors on his first two laps, which led to his times being deleted, and he had to string one together just as the session was ending. Even so, 2.088secs off pole position is unfamiliar territory for the man who has dominated F1 for the past two years. Starting fourth, though, Verstappen may still be tough to beat over 19 laps in the sprint. \"It was incredibly slippery,\" the world champion said. \"I struggled a lot to get the temperature in the tyres. That's why it was just very difficult to keep the car on track and it never really switched on for me.  \"It was like driving on ice and that's why it's deserved, where we are in qualifying. It was not really working for me in the wet even though in the dry it looked quite good.\" Andrew Benson Q&A: Send us your questions "

        "text": " Max Verstappen annihilated the competition to win the Chinese Grand Prix. The Dutchman was in a league of his own again - even over his team-mate Sergio Perez - in a race punctuated by two mid-race safety cars in quick succession. Safety cars broke up Red Bull's cruise to a one-two finish, shuffling Perez behind McLaren's Lando Norris and Ferrari's Charles Leclerc. The Mexican soon picked off Leclerc but Norris drove an exceptional final stint to hold on to second ahead of Perez. Full race results How Chinese GP unfolded Horner criticises Wolff over Verstappen comments Verstappen underlined his superiority over everyone, including Perez, with a crushing first stint of the race. The world champion converted his pole position into a lead at the first corner while Perez was passed around the outside by Fernando Alonso's Aston Martin, which started third. It took Perez until lap five to pass Alonso, by which time Verstappen was five seconds up the road. And over the eight laps before his pit stop, Verstappen lapped at least 0.5 seconds faster than Perez to extend his lead to 10 seconds by the time he stopped for tyres for the first time on lap 13, a gap large enough for Red Bull to pit both cars on the same lap without losing any time. The next demonstration of Verstappen's superiority came three laps later when he caught and passed Leclerc - he had made up a pit stop's worth of race time over a man battling for the final podium place in just 16 laps. After that, he calmly navigated the rest of the race, well clear of the rest of the field, to take his fourth win in five races this year - victorious in all the events he has finished. Perez looked to be cruising to a comfortable second place behind Verstappen, but the safety cars, which came in quick succession, changed the complexion of the race for the remaining podium places. First, Valtteri Bottas pulled off with an engine failure at Turn 11 on lap 20, and there will be questions as to how long it took the race director to deploy first the virtual safety car and then the safety car with marshals on the track trying to remove the car. Leclerc had dropped to eighth on the first lap after a jink to hold off an attack by team-mate Carlos Sainz at the first corner allowed Mercedes' George Russell and Haas driver Nico Hulkenberg both past. But as the first stint developed, and Leclerc found his tyres in good shape but his pace not special, Ferrari began to think about a one-stop strategy in an attempt to beat Norris, who was initially planning two. The Bottas incident allowed first Leclerc and then Norris to pit and save time compared to Perez, leap-frogging them in front of the Red Bull. And when a second safety car immediately followed the first because of two incidents on the restart on lap 27, Norris also switched to a one-stop, and the race came down to whether Perez could catch and pass both Leclerc and Norris to reclaim the one-two.  Leclerc succumbed relatively quickly, but Norris was more than able to match the Red Bull's pace, and he held on to take an excellent second place ahead of Perez. Behind Leclerc, Sainz nursed older tyres to make it a Ferrari four-five ahead of Russell, while behind them Alonso provided some late entertainment. Unusually, Aston Martin chose soft tyres for the veteran Spaniard when they stopped under the safety car, which meant another pit stop on lap 44, with 12 to go. The stop dropped Alonso to 11th place, but he used his fresh medium tyres to carve through the field, passing Esteban Ocon's Alpine, Hulkenberg, Lewis Hamilton's Mercedes and McLaren's Oscar Piastri, whose car was also damaged in the Stroll/Ricciardo incident, to take seventh. In the course of it, he rescued a wild moment at the final corner while chasing Hamilton, dipping his right rear wheel onto the gravel in exactly the same way as Sainz had when crashing in qualifying on Saturday, but saving the huge slide with remarkable skills and reactions. Piastri's car had been damaged in a concertina effect at the hairpin at the first restart, when Lance Stroll's Aston Martin cannoned into Daniel Ricciardo's RB, which then rammed Piastri. On the first restart lap, Haas driver Kevin Magnussen collided with Ricciardo's team-mate Yuki Tsunoda and the two incidents led to the safety car being deployed again. Magnussen and Stroll were both penalised 10 seconds for the incidents. It was a low-key day for Hamilton, who spent the first part complaining about lacking pace, but with the help of the safety cars managed to haul himself up into the points in ninth, even if sixth and ninth amounted to another chastening day for Mercedes.

        "text": " Max Verstappen fought past Lewis Hamilton and Fernando Alonso to win the Chinese Grand Prix sprint race. Pole-sitter Lando Norris slid wide at the first corner trying to fend off Hamilton's Mercedes. Verstappen took a few laps to find his feet in the Red Bull but soon homed in on his rivals ahead. Alonso hung on until late on when Ferrari's Carlos Sainz overtook him before Red Bull's Sergio Perez took advantage to pass both for third. Sainz then fought with team-mate Charles Leclerc, the two Ferraris touching wheels at the hairpin before an unhappy Leclerc prevailed to take fourth ahead of the Spaniard and a disappointed Norris. Alonso, after pitting to change a tyre punctured in his clash with Sainz, was told within a lap to retire the car because of damage. How to follow the Chinese Grand Prix F1 Q&A: Ricciardo, Albon, Alonso & Chinese Grand Prix How Chinese GP sprint race unfolded Verstappen said: \"The first few laps were quite hectic. They were pushing quite hard up front and I had Carlos behind with new tyres and it was very difficult to keep him behind. \"Then as the race went on we became stronger and I felt more comfortable with the balance of the car and could look after my tyres. Very pleased with that.\" The win gave him another eight points towards a fourth championship that already appears inevitable. Verstappen's win had an easy certainty about it as he clinically went about his business of dispatching his rivals from fourth on the grid, achieved in a hectic wet qualifying session on Friday. He pulled out a 13-second advantage in just 10 laps, leaving little hope for the grand prix on Sunday.  Hamilton's second place was by far his best result of a season that has started in a difficult fashion for a Mercedes team struggling with their new car. Hamilton: \"That's the best result I've had in a long time so I am super-happy and grateful, this is a huge step and improvement.  \"The race was tough and if I was further back I would have struggled to progress, I found a lot about this car through this short stint so I am excited about tomorrow.\" It was behind the two men who fought out a bitter title fight in 2021 where all the action took place. Heading into the second half of the race, Alonso was leading a train of cars involving Sainz, Perez, Leclerc and Norris. The veteran Spaniard, who last week signed a new two-year contract with Aston Martin that will keep him in F1 until at least 2026, looked to have the measure of Sainz. But as Alonso's tyres began to fade into the closing laps, Sainz attacked, attempting to go around the Aston Martin through the fast Turns Seven and Eight with three laps to go. As the two Spaniards fought wheel to wheel, the cars appeared to touch, which may have been where Alonso sustained the damage that forced his retirement and Perez managed to sneak ahead of both to take third place. Behind him, Sainz then immediately came under attack from Leclerc, who drew alongside down the long back straight and tried to pass around the outside of the hairpin at the end of it. Sainz ran wide and the two cars touched wheels as an unhappy Leclerc was forced off the track, but the man who is staying at Ferrari at the end of this season passed the one who is leaving at Turn One at the start of then next lap to take fourth.

        "text": " Mercedes team principal Toto Wolff painted a bleak but realistic picture of the Formula 1 season after the Japanese Grand Prix. \"No-one is going to catch Max this year,\" he said, following Max Verstappen's success at Suzuka.  \"His driving and the car are just spectacular. You can see it by the way he manages the tyres. This season is [about] best of the rest. That is the fight that is on.\" It was not exactly news. Verstappen's win on Sunday was exactly what was expected, and exactly what he achieved in two of the three races preceding it. And may well have done in the other had a brake problem not eased a path to victory for Ferrari's Carlos Sainz in Australia two weeks before. Still, for a person with pretensions of being a rival for Red Bull, Wolff's was a pretty bleak assessment after the fourth race, getting on for the quarter-way point of the championship. Most of Verstappen's rivals expected this season to be like this, if perhaps not quite to such an extent. After all, the Dutchman and Red Bull have dominated F1 since about the halfway point of the 2022 season, when a brief challenge from Ferrari at the start of a new regulation set finally expired in a bonfire of strategy errors and reliability failings. How Japanese Grand Prix unfolded  Verstappen wins in Japan after crash delay  Verstappen went into this season on the back of the most dominant year in F1 history. It simply doesn't happen in F1 that one team and driver have such an advantage one year and don't retain at least some form of edge into the following one as well. So predictions of a close season were thin on the ground over the winter.  There was, though, some hope that Red Bull's rivals might catch up. So far, although the chasing pack has moved around a bit, that has not really materialised. But both Verstappen and the team that has become his closest rivals this year - Ferrari - believe that it still might yet. \"Melbourne felt like a bit of a hiccup,\" said Verstappen. \"But what we did today, that's what we want to do, and that's what we aim to do every single weekend. \"It's still a very long season. I don't want to think about the rest of the season too much. I really want to approach it race by race.  \"I know there will be tracks coming up that might not be so favourable for us. When we do get to tracks where we know that we can be quick, we have to really take advantage of it and score the maximum amount of points as a team, and that's what we'll continue to try and do.  \"And then, of course, I think we know that we get to tracks where maybe it's a bit more difficult we have to try and maximise that as well, where maybe other teams can win as well.\" Where could those tracks be? After Red Bull's struggles in Singapore last year - the only time they were beaten in all of 2023 - Verstappen has his ideas. \"Looking at the history so far, street circuits are in general a little bit more difficult for us,\" he added. \"I do think that our car has improved a bit, you know, in the low speed.  \"But of course, on a street circuit, it's not only low speed, it's drivability, it's kerb riding, riding over the bumps. So general ride of a car. So these things are still a little bit unknown at the moment of how well we have improved on that.\" Andrew Benson's Q&A: Send us your questions Behind Red Bull, a pattern is emerging, and one that has rendered all of the races this year, frankly, a bit dull. Ferrari are clearly best of the rest. McLaren are the third fastest team, and there is a debate to be had over the order of Mercedes and Aston Martin in fourth and fifth. The performance of all four of these cars over one lap on tyres with maximum grip that hide some of the machinery's weaknesses is close enough that the grid order can be jumbled. But in the race the true pace of the cars comes through. Charles Leclerc was outstanding in recovering from a difficult qualifying, which left him lining up eighth. He used the fact he was the only frontrunner to try a one-stop strategy - slower on paper than two, but allowing him to run at his own pace for longer - to finish an impressive fourth behind his Ferrari team-mate Carlos Sainz. But Leclerc could do this only because of the giant strides his team have made since last year. Ferrari had the second fastest car by the end of 2023 as well - although they certainly did not start last year in that position - but in terms of overall competitiveness they have taken a step closer to Red Bull this season. This is not so obvious in qualifying, but it certainly is in races, where their consistency and tyre management has improved exponentially. And there are hopes of more to come, enough even to put them in the fight with Red Bull by perhaps mid-season. \"Very satisfying,\" said Sainz. \"We exactly improved the car in the places that we wanted to improve it, and Suzuka proves it. Still, places like Suzuka, we are not as quick as the Red Bull, which is the target. But as soon as we bring a good upgrade to the car that goes in the right direction, hopefully it can get us closer.  \"We've improved everywhere, and especially in the race pace. It also allows us to have more strategic flexibility, that last year we didn't have. \"I think they are definitely going to have an advantage in the first third of the season until we bring one or two upgrades that makes us fight them more consistently. \"But by that time maybe it's a bit too late with the advantage that they might have in the championship.\" The effect of team principal Frederic Vasseur, employed to clean up the mess the team was in at the end of 2022, is plain to see, and there appears to be a positive forward momentum at Maranello.  Vasseur said: \"We made a huge step on the high-speed [corners] compared to last year and Suzuka is a good example and on the tyre management. But now we have other weaknesses. It is always a compromise; you improve somewhere and you lose somewhere else.  \"Overall, if you compare with Red Bull on the last four races of last year to this year, to the first four events this season, we have made a decent step forward.  \"For sure they are still a little bit ahead. The target is to be be able to put them under pressure and with pressure you do more mistakes. It was not the case today but I hope it will be the case in the future.\" McLaren were the team that made the most progress in 2023, with an impressive leap from close to the back to close to the front. But while Lando Norris scored more points than anyone other than Verstappen in the second half of last year, their forward progress has stalled somewhat this year. Norris and team-mate Oscar Piastri finished second and third behind Verstappen in Japan last year; this time around they were fifth and eighth. So much for closing on Red Bull at the start of this season.  \"Seventeen seconds behind the win last year and today I am 29,\" Norris said. \"Facts are facts.\" Like Ferrari, though, McLaren can see better things on the horizon. Team principal Andrea Stella said after Japan that he was pleased that they had consolidated their position as the third best team. And the first of a series of upgrades is due in Miami in two races' time. Stella, though, also offers little prospect of McLaren catching Verstappen. For Lewis Hamilton, Ferrari's progress may well be underlining the wisdom of his decision to leave Mercedes for Italy at the end of this season. But that is little consolation to the seven-time world champion or team-mate George Russell right now. Seventh and ninth in qualifying - with Hamilton ahead - became seventh and ninth in the race - with Russell ahead.  \"To finish ninth was really bad,\" said Hamilton. \"It's where our car is at the moment. I don't know if you can take many positives from the weekend.\" After qualifying, Hamilton had professed himself happier with the balance of the Mercedes than at any point since the start of 2022. But any hope that this car can be what Mercedes wanted it to be - a strong baseline on to which they can pile more performance over time - is tempered by the fact they are still publicly admitting they are a little bit lost. Wolff said: \"We are measuring with our sensors and pressure table and it is saying we have 70 points more downforce in a particular corner in Melbourne, but on the lap time it is not 1km/h faster. So it doesn't make any sense. And we wanted to tick a few boxes to understand - 'Is there a limitation we haven't spotted?' And I think there is. \"The downforce is there but we are not able to extract the lap time that we should and the simulations show us. I see you looking at us, like, 'What the hell?' Imagine what we think.\" Do Mercedes have a better car than Aston Martin? The average qualifying lap times say no - the Aston is 0.036secs quicker over four races so far. Mercedes are one point ahead of Aston in the constructors', which also points to the green car being faster. For whatever your position on the relative merits of Hamilton, Russell and Alonso as drivers, few would put the Spaniard's team-mate Lance Stroll in their bracket, and he has just one point fewer than Hamilton so far. Alonso, though, said after finishing sixth in Japan, ahead of both Mercedes drivers, that he believes he is outperforming his car. \"My best weekend - or in the top five - ever for me,\" said Alonso. \"P5 yesterday in qualifying, that lap, and P6 in the race is completely out of position.  \"I think we are the fifth fastest team by a good margin to the fourth and a good margin to the sixth. We are quite established there, there is no way to compare us to the Ferrari, McLaren, Red Bull and Mercedes.  \"So that's why to finish P5 and P6 is completely unusual. We did it in Australia as well, we finished P6 again. We are executing very well the races and the others are experimenting a little bit with strategy and so on. \" Many will see this as what some see as typical Alonso self-mythologising. Except that Stella happens to share his view. \"If you look at the order it goes in the order of car competitiveness,\" said Stella, who worked with the two-time champion for nine years at Ferrari and McLaren. \"Considering that Fernando, he has done a very good job, like he normally does. He is a little special in that respect and outdoes a little bit the potential of the cars.\""

        "text": " Russian racing driver Nikita Mazepin has overturned European Union sanctions imposed as part of the response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Mazepin, who drove in Formula 1 for Haas in 2021, and his father had assets frozen and were given a travel ban. His father, billionaire businessman Dmitry Mazepin, was deemed a close associate of president Vladimir Putin.  But the EU's general court said the link to his father is not enough for the driver to remain on sanction lists. It said the \"association\" criteria used in the sanctions require the existence of a link beyond a simple family relationship. The 25-year-old was also sanctioned by the UK and Canada in March 2022 - sanctions which remain in place. He is also challenging those rulings in the hope of returning to F1. Mazepin was sacked by Haas as a result of the invasion.  He owed his seat to sponsorship funding from the Russian chemicals business Uralkali, which is part-owned by his father through his company Uralchem."

        "text": " Max Verstappen was in imperious form as he took pole position for the Chinese Grand Prix, leading Sergio Perez to a Red Bull one-two. Fresh from winning the first sprint race of the season earlier, Verstappen was 0.322 seconds clear of Perez. The Mexican pipped Fernando Alonso's Aston Martin by 0.166secs with McLaren's Lando Norris and Oscar Piastri next. Lewis Hamilton had a dire day, qualifying 18th. His Mercedes team-mate George Russell was eighth behind Ferrari's Charles Leclerc and Carlos Sainz. How to follow the Chinese Grand Prix Full qualifying results Verstappen beats Hamilton to sprint race win Hamilton - who made a mistake in the hairpin, running wide and costing himself some time - said he had made \"massive\" set-up changes to his Mercedes after finishing second to Verstappen in the sprint race. \"I'll give it my best shot - 18th is pretty bad,\" Hamilton said. \"When I was making the set-up changes, I was like: 'It can't get any worse, surely.' And it did!\" Red Bull looked in a world of their own all day, even though Perez came close to being knocked out at the end of the first session after being caught up with traffic. The surprise was Alonso, whose Aston Martin has not looked a match for Ferrari or McLaren generally this season, but third was an impressive outcome for the veteran Spaniard. Alonso had run third for much of the sprint before damage from a collision with Sainz forced his retirement, but he made amends with a strong performance in qualifying for the grand prix. Alonso said: \"I had a moment in Turns One and Two and I was thinking about whether to abort or not, but we kept going and I set a good lap time. The car improved since this morning and we made a few changes.\" Sainz crashed at the end of his first lap in second qualifying but managed to get the Ferrari back to the pits minus its front wing, where Ferrari discovered it was otherwise undamaged. Stewards later dismissed a protest against Sainz. Aston Martin argued that, on the basis of a rule that says a driver whose car stops on track will not be permitted to take any further part in qualifying, he should be disqualified. Stewards ruled that he was permitted to continue because he had not received outside assistance to restart his car. He and Leclerc were Red Bull's closest challengers in the second session, albeit more than 0.3secs off their pace, but they fell away in the final session allowing Alonso and the McLarens to start ahead. Leclerc said: \"We set up the car on my side mostly for the race, however we did not expect McLaren and Fernando to jump us.  \"It is a bit further back than we would have liked but we have good race pace and tyre management which gives me confidence we can come back to third.\" Behind Russell, Haas driver Nico Hulkenberg and Sauber's Valtteri Bottas completed the top 10. At RB, Daniel Ricciardo had his best performance of the season in 12th, on the race the team changed his chassis in an attempt to find a solution to the Australian's struggles so far this season. Team-mate Yuki Tsunoda was a mystified 19th, unable to explain his sudden lack of pace. Andrew Benson Q&A: Send us your questions How Chinese GP qualifying unfolded"

        "text": " The woman who made accusations about Christian Horner's behaviour is to appeal against Red Bull's decision to dismiss her complaint. The woman, who Red Bull last week suspended from her position, accused the team principal of inappropriate and controlling behaviour. She will ask Red Bull to reconsider their decision, which was made after an investigation conducted by a lawyer. Horner, 50, has always denied the accusations made against him. The accusations against Horner came to light in early February but the investigation into his behaviour had started almost a month before. Red Bull appointed an external lawyer to investigate the claims. After his report was submitted to the company's board, it decided to dismiss the complaint. The following day, a cache of messages purporting to involve Horner was leaked to nearly 150 senior F1 insiders and media. Horner has said it is \"time to draw a line under\" the controversy amid continuing speculation about the independence of the inquiry and Red Bull's reasons for making the decision. The complainant's decision to fight back against Red Bull's actions is a further indication that the controversy is likely to continue for some time. If Red Bull again dismisses the woman's case, she has the option to take legal action against both Red Bull and Horner. Red Bull has refused to give further details of the case, citing confidentiality. BBC Sport has previously reported that the reason given by Red Bull to the employee was that she had been dishonest. Red Bull's engine partner Honda has called for more details about the matter. Horner said at last weekend's Saudi Arabian Grand Prix: \"The reality is that there was a grievance raised, it was dealt with in the most professional manner by the group, that appointed an independent KC, one of the most reputable in the land. \"He took time to investigate all the facts. He looked at everything and he came to a conclusion where he dismissed the grievance. \"As far as I'm concerned, as far as Red Bull is concerned, we move on.\" The controversy is at the centre of a power struggle inside Red Bull, involving Horner, the motorsport adviser Helmut Marko, the team's three-time world champion Max Verstappen and his father Jos and manager Raymond Vermeulen, and the two owners of the company. Last weekend, an intervention by Max Verstappen was instrumental in keeping Marko from being dismissed.  Chalerm Yoovidhya, the 51% shareholder has backed Horner and forced 49% shareholders Red Bull Gmbh in Austria to back down in wanting to force him out."

        "text": " Sign up for notifications to the latest Insight features via the BBC Sport app and find the most recent in the series. Sometimes a small detail marks a big step forward. By 2002, an event called the Australian Open Wheelchair Tennis Championships had been running for a few years in Melbourne. It had a big draw - 45 players in the men's singles, 22 in the women's and an accompanying quad competition - ranking points and prize money. It took place at Melbourne Park, which also hosts the Australian Open. The only thing it lacked was timing. The Australian Open Wheelchair Tennis Championships took place a few weeks after the Australian Open, when the crowds, media attention and associated glamour had drained away. The Classic 8s was a far smaller event - eight players in men's and women's singles - with minimal prize money and ranking points. It attracted little more than a brief mention in the mainstream press. But, crucially, in 2002 it was staged alongside the Australian Open, in the midst of Lleyton Hewitt's attempt to reel in a home Grand Slam, Kim Clijsters' run to the semi-finals and Jennifer Capriati's final major title. It was the first time an official wheelchair tennis competition had been part of any of the big four annual events. \"There was a bit of 'wow, we're at a Grand Slam' but to be honest, it didn't feel huge,\" says Jayant Mistry, now 57 and the only Briton to compete at the event in 2002. \"It didn't feel huge because we'd already been doing exhibitions and everything else, and we weren't really sure where this was actually going.\" Where it was going was forwards, and at some pace - within five years, the other three Grand Slams had also incorporated wheelchair competitions. The Australian Open paved the way again in 2017 with the staging of a wheelchair final on a Grand Slam centre court, with all the majors now putting finals on show courts. By 2019, all four Grand Slams also had a quad competition.  The Classic 8s wasn't the first time wheelchair tennis players had played alongside the best of the non-disabled game. \"It was very prestigious to be invited to that,\" says Mistry of playing at the Miami Open in Florida, which had staged a wheelchair tennis tournament for more than a decade before 2002. \"I remember a few times we would be like: 'We're in the same lounge as the Williams sisters, Andre Agassi and Pete Sampras!' We were absolutely in awe of those guys.\" But the Classic 8s was the first time wheelchair tennis had appeared at a Grand Slam - a piece of scheduling that turbocharged the sport's development. Wheelchair tennis was only invented in the late 1970s. Pioneered in the United States by Brad Parks, a former freestyle skier paralysed in an accident, and Jeff Minnebraker, a therapist who had custom built his own manoeuvrable wheelchair, it reached Europe a few years later.  In 1988, the International Wheelchair Tennis Federation was formed and a decade later it was fully integrated into the International Tennis Federation (ITF), making it the first disability sport to enter such a union at a global level. Mistry believes these developments paved the way for integrated Grand Slams. \"The biggest thing that happened was that in the early 1990s the ITF decided they wanted to have somebody [former top player Ellen de Lange] representing wheelchair tennis sitting in the organisation itself. That was a massive coup for us,\" he says. \"Rather than being on the outside looking in, you're on the inside and can influence the bigger chiefs.\" Wheelchair tennis had been a big success since it was introduced into the Paralympics in 1992, with huge crowds enjoying the competition in Sydney in 2000. \"Part of the reason wheelchair tennis at the 2002 Australian Open came about was not only did we have great buy-in from the ITF, but also they had had the 2000 Paralympics in Sydney as well,\" says Mistry.  \"That was a much bigger stage, and I think once you're in those kind of areas other people are noticing the sport.\" Mistry first noticed it in 1986 when he saw a demonstration while playing wheelchair basketball at Stoke Mandeville. Before long he had won the national title and was selected to play international events.  Nowadays, an elite performance sports chair designed for tennis can cost upwards of \u00c2\u00a34,500. \"In the very old days, we only had one wheelchair so you'd use it for tennis, for basketball and for everything else,\" Mistry recalls. Making a living in such a fledgling industry was no easy matter. Japanese teenager Tokito Oda collected \u00c2\u00a360,000 for winning his wheelchair singles title at last year's Wimbledon, but when Mistry was first playing the financial rewards were almost non-existent. \"Prize money didn't come in until the mid-1990s. The winner of a tournament maybe got $500-$1,000 (\u00c2\u00a3395-\u00c2\u00a3790) and the vast majority of the money seemed to be in the United States,\" he says.  That meant lots of travel, which was tricky to combine with a full-time job.  \"I played for 20 years but 13 of those years I worked as well, so all my holiday was always taken up by playing tournaments,\" says Mistry, who was a leisure centre attendant for Leicester City Council before moving into a career in sports development.  \"When I was working 9-5, I used to get up at five in the morning to fit in training. Once I flew back from Japan, landed at 6:30 in the morning and was at my desk at 1pm because I only had so much annual leave. \"Another time I was playing a tournament in Japan and the next week I was playing in Atlanta. Because of the cost involved, my travel agent decided to send me back to England first and then fly over to the States. In total it was 38 hours and four different flights. When I finally ended up in Atlanta the person who was supposed to be picking me up didn't turn up.\" Meanwhile, holidays were a luxury afforded neither by money nor time.  Help arrived in the form of National Lottery funding before the 2000 Paralympics in Sydney - that year Mistry stopped working and committed to tennis full-time. Even so, the financial rewards were still scant - Australian quad wheelchair tennis legend Dylan Alcott famously described prize money in the sport's early days as having been \"a firm handshake and a cold Powerade [drink]\".  At that landmark Classic 8s event at the 2002 Australian Open, Mistry reached the semi-finals of the singles and won the doubles with Dutch partner Robin Ammerlaan.  \"We got a little toy kangaroo and a trophy,\" he remembers. \"It was amazing and wonderful to be part of, but the prize money wasn't great. I think I got about 1,000 Australian dollars so \u00c2\u00a3400 or so.\"  In 2005, Mistry and Frenchman Michael Jeremiasz won the inaugural wheelchair competition at Wimbledon, for which they earned \u00c2\u00a31,300 each. Fast forward to 2023 and the wheelchair doubles champions at the All England Club, Alfie Hewett and Gordon Reid, picked up \u00c2\u00a313,000 each. Mistry says he would not change a thing about his career, during which he travelled the world and made life-long friendships. Those times may not have been flush with cash, but they were rich in experience - including a locker-room chat with Agassi before a US Open final. \"When you entered a tournament in those days you'd pay an entry fee, say \u00c2\u00a3200, and that would include accommodation, food, entry into the tournament,\" Mistry, a four-time Paralympian who won 68 titles and who was a top-10 player in singles or doubles for over 12 years, remembers.  \"I was playing the French Open once and sharing with a French guy. I didn't know him, they just put us in a room. His snoring was so bad that I actually had to take my pillow and my duvet and sleep in the hallway. \"Today everyone's got individual rooms, they've got their coaches with them, they're flying first class. It's a different world. I think in an average year, even towards the end of my career, I was probably earning \u00c2\u00a320,000 for the year and I would have done 20 tournaments.\" When it was announced in August 2001 that the following year's Australian Open would feature a wheelchair competition, Tennis Australia president Geoff Pollard said: \"This new initiative gives us a chance to continue to grow the sport by showcasing the world's best.\" Staging the wheelchair game in the same time and space as a Grand Slam changed perceptions, integrating wheelchair tennis into the non-disabled game in a way that is, as Mistry puts it, \"built in, not bolted on\".  He adds: \"It's not only it being at the Grand Slams which gives it a sort of credibility, but the exposure of being part of the event too.  \"It adds a great deal towards the inclusive nature that wheelchair tennis brings.\"  The exposure has helped the likes of Alcott, all-conquering Dutch legend Esther Vergeer, and Mistry's compatriot and eight-time Grand Slam singles champion Hewett - who was on the shortlist for the 2023 BBC Sports Personality of the Year - become genuine stars. These days it is common for a wheelchair event to run within an ATP or WTA event - the prestigious Queen's Club tournament in London is among those to stage one - and this trend looks set to continue.  Vergeer, who runs a tournament in Rotterdam, told the ITF in 2020:, external \"The regular standalone wheelchair tennis tournaments need to exist and they are very, very important for the development and the growth of the sport.  \"But to raise the profile of wheelchair tennis and getting it seen by more and more public I think it is important that we are integrating more and more tournaments throughout the year.\" Combining with the non-disabled game has helped wheelchair tennis' continued growth. By last year, the Wheelchair Tennis Tour, which began in 1992 with a handful of events, had expanded to a circuit of 169 tournaments in 40 countries.  The tour encompasses seven tiers, as well as a junior series. Its popularity is also booming.  A 10,000-strong crowd witnessed Hewett and Reid win last year's Wimbledon men's wheelchair doubles title on Court One. Mistry is proud of the sport's huge progress and growing popularity.  He says: \"In 2002 at the Australian Open, we played on the outside courts and it was decent from what I remember. They were good crowds and very appreciative. Some people came and said, 'Oh, what's this going on?' - I don't think they knew it was a competition, I think maybe they thought it was an exhibition match or something.  \"It was decent, but when I look at where wheelchair tennis is now... I commentated for the final at Wimbledon with Gordon and Alfie last year and that was amazing.  \"To be on Court One with that many people in, especially with the roof closed, it was just a phenomenal atmosphere and showed how far things have come.\""

The government's stance comes despite the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport Lucy Frazer saying last year that \"any plans to allow Russian and Belarusian athletes to participate in Paris are not credible\". Frazer also chaired a summit of 36 countries that released a joint statement pledging their support for a ban on Russian and Belarusian athletes competing in international sporting events. But officials deny that the move represents a U-turn, with a government spokesperson saying: \"Russian and Belarusian athletes representing their country should not be permitted in domestic or international sporting competition. That position still stands.\" The government is said to have been satisfied by the effectiveness of what it regards as stricter and aligned neutrality conditions adopted by both the IOC and IPC. The Olympics take place from 26 July to 11 August and the Paralympics from 28 August until 8 September."

        "text": " Two-time Paralympic champion Lora Fachie says becoming a mother has challenged her as an athlete in new ways. Fachie, who is married to fellow Para-cyclist and Paralympic champion Neil, gave birth to son Fraser in November 2022, and told BBC Sport that motherhood is the hardest thing she has ever done. \"Pushing your body to the limit in training is hard and painful, but you are the one in control,\" said the 35-year-old.  \"As a parent, you aren't necessarily in control and babies don't come with a manual so you are constantly having to adjust and reassess and change plans.  \"I was an athlete who likes a plan and sticks to it and I am quite a logical thinker and babies don't do that, so it tests you, especially in the early days.\" Both Lora and Neil will be hoping for more success at the Para-cycling Track World Championships which start on Wednesday in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, where they will be watched by Fraser. They will be part of a 27-strong British team, which also includes Jody Cundy, Kadeena Cox and Jaco van Gass with all of the riders bidding to put in strong performances to help earn selection for this summer's Paris Paralympics. The Fachies, who both have visual impairments, provided one of the memorable moments of the Tokyo Games in 2021 when they both won gold within the space of an hour - first Neil and sighted pilot Matt Rotherham claimed victory in the B 1,000m time trial before Lora and Corrine Hall won the B 3km individual pursuit. But those celebrations seemed a long way away in the early days of parenthood with challenges around Fraser's birth and struggles around breastfeeding which prompted Lora to speak out - a move which helped open up a wider conversation around the subject. \"I wish I could go back to me of 12 months ago and say it will all be fine, but when you are living with it and caught up in it, it's very hard, but things are definitely much better now,\" she reflects. \"I don't deal with failure very well, I know that, so it was just one knock after another and it took me to take a complete step back from it and change how we fed Fraser. Sometimes change is good and after that both of us started to thrive.\" Neil says: \"For Lora to speak out was incredible. It was really heart-warming to hear all the stories from others who got in touch, some who were struggling, others who had gone through it but it was a community coming together. \"We thought it was a really important message to put out there. It was raw, it was hard but I think it helped Lora to process it. It certainly helped me to speak about it.\" As well as motherhood, Lora also had to deal with returning to training and competition and she made her comeback to action at last year's World Championships in Glasgow, just eight months after giving birth.  She won a silver medal in the B individual pursuit with Hall, but was critical of British Cycling's treatment around her return, saying she felt, external she had been \"punished\" for having a baby and had been left \"isolated\" and with a \"lack of support\".  The organisation referred itself to an independent investigation, but before this year's events in Rio and Paris, Lora says she has seen positive changes. \"British Cycling have supported me around travelling out to Rio so I can stay close to Fraser and I can still see him whenever and help out if necessary,\" she says. \"It is with the aim of preparing both of us - me more so than Fraser, because he will be with his grandparents and will have a great time - for Paris where I might not get to see him as much as I would like because of security. \"The Paralympics is a very different experience and I want to make sure if I go to Paris, I am in the best shape I can be. \"Sometimes you have to be a little bit selfish. But knowing that he is happy and thriving with my parents is important so I can focus and do what I need to do. \"I would love to win gold in Rio but I just want to make sure I secure my place on the team for Paris.\" The couple are awaiting an official diagnosis to confirm that Fraser has a visual impairment. Lora says that there is no guarantee that he will follow his parents on to the back of a tandem in the future. \"People ask me if we have got Fraser a bike yet. We have got him a trike but I don't want him to be a cyclist - I want him to be his own person,\" she says. \"I don't want him to have to live in the shadow of Neil and I. I want him to find his own way. If it is cycling I will support him but I would rather he found his own thing - sport or music or whatever it is that makes him happy. \"He is becoming his own little person and developing his own personality. He is so funny and having that to come home to is so refreshing. I've never laughed as much as I do now, even when you are doing the most stupid things just to get a laugh from him. \"It is the best drug in the world.\" Revealing the truth about the stories that matter: Reporter Rory Carson meets the caravan park residents  There's a million ways to get it wrong: John Wilson presents a superbly strange guide to modern life"

        "description": "For Jack Eyers, choosing to have his right leg amputated at just 16 was \"the best decision I ever made\".",
        "text": " For Jack Eyers, choosing to have his right leg amputated at just 16 was \"the best decision I ever made\". It is a decision that has given him a modelling career, and a Mr England crown. It is also a decision that has led to him winning two World Championship titles in Para-canoe. But for the 35-year-old, the best is yet to come.  Having missed out on the Tokyo 2020 Paralympics, Paris 2024 is an opportunity Eyers is refusing to let pass him by, determined to tick off his biggest achievement yet. \"I'm massively grateful and proud of being a two-time world champion, but to call myself a Paralympian... those are the people that I started to look up to, especially when I first had my leg amputated,\" he told BBC Sport. \"To reach a level of a role model that you've looked up to, in my eyes, is success.\" Born with a condition called proximal femoral focal deficiency (PFFD), which affected his hip, knee and femur, a teenage Eyers was \"very embarrassed\" and \"very ashamed\" of how his leg looked. Initially advised to wait until he was 18 and had stopped growing, he convinced doctors to amputate above the knee at 16. \"I'm able to put a positive spin [on it] because my situation before amputation was far worse, in my opinion, than living life as an amputee,\" he said. After his amputation, Eyers - from Bournemouth - played wheelchair basketball for GB juniors but later quit the sport to focus on his fledging career as a personal trainer. He had his own business, working with other amputees and people with physical impairments, when he was contacted by Models of Diversity, a charity that campaigns for a greater diversity of models in the media and on catwalks. Initially starting out in fitness modelling, he noticed a \"grey area\" in the lack of disabled models being used in the fashion world. \"My goal was to challenge a perception of disability,\" he said. In 2017, he became the first amputee to be crowned Mr England, and since then has modelled at London and New York Fashion Weeks. \"I'm quite happy to say that I was one of the first amputees to really step into that world and it wasn't a very common thing,\" Eyers said. \"Now it's quite common to see disabled models on the catwalks, whether that be in a wheelchair or amputee. \"It was very nerve-wracking because you don't know what people are going to think. Some of the able-bodied models, you could tell they weren't too happy about it.  \"Before New York, I went to Italy. Fashion designers and catwalk producers just weren't happy with the idea because they were talking about the catwalk being like the ballet, there needs to be classic same shape models, same height models. We were changing that, we were changing the mould I believe for the better and it has been for the better.\" As well as his Mr England title, 2017 also marked the year in which Eyers joined the Great Britain Para-canoe programme. His VL3 category made its Paralympic debut at the Tokyo 2020 Games - rearranged to 2021 because of the Covid-19 pandemic - and Eyers had been hoping to do the same, but was left \"absolutely devastated\" when he wasn't selected. \"I honestly thought that I was going to achieve it,\" he said. \"I had to do a lot of work on myself to channel that into something good.\" 'Something good', it turned out, was just around the corner. Just weeks after the Paralympics ended, Eyers won his first World Championship gold medal in Copenhagen. \"I believe that's why I came out on top, because I figured out a way of using my emotions and I channelled them into success,\" he said.  Eyers retained his world title the following year, while 2022 also brought him a maiden European crown. He will go for a third World Championship title in Szeged, Hungary, in May. But it is September that is circled on his calendar, his second shot at the Paralympics, and Eyers says competing in Paris would mark the \"creme de la creme\" of his career. \"It would make my career, it would be absolutely an overwhelming experience. It would be the pinnacle,\" he said.   \"I'm in the best position that I could possibly be in. I am a completely different athlete than I was going for the Tokyo Games.  \"My race plan has grown and developed, my physical ability has grown and developed, my resilience is there as well and I'm feeling really happy.\"   Reduce stress levels and make peace with imperfections...: Escape the noise of daily life with the ultimate therapeutic podcast Frank Skinner's baffling take on online reviews: If you reviewed Ben Nevis online as 'very steep and too high', this show salutes you!"

        "text": " English wheelchair curler Stewart Pimblett has an eye on history as he prepares for the World Championships in South Korea. Pimblett will be taking part in the mixed doubles event in Gangneung from 11-16 March. His ultimate aim is to be part of the Great Britain team for the 2026 Winter Paralympics in Milan-Cortina. If the 54-year-old is selected, he would be in line to become the first non-Scot to represent Britain in the sport at a Paralympics. \"I've done really well to get to where I am, but I'm not there yet,\" Pimblett told BBC Sport. \"I've always wanted to go to a Paralympics but not just to make up the numbers. I want to bring back a medal - that is my goal. \"Milan is there in the back of my thoughts, but I don't want to become complacent. I feel like I am in a good place mentally and physically with two years to go and I hope I am doing the right things - but all of us on the Great Britain squad are working hard. \"I will do everything I can and hopefully make it hard for the selectors to leave me out of that Paralympic squad. If I don't get there, it won't be for the want of trying.\" Before taking up wheelchair curling, Pimblett, who was paralysed in a road accident when he was nine, played wheelchair basketball, representing Great Britain, although he never made it to a Paralympics. After watching coverage of wheelchair curling from the 2010 Winter Paralympics in Vancouver and seeing some of his former wheelchair basketball team-mates taking part, he gave the sport a try. He fell in love with it, going on to launch the Northern Ice club in Northumberland, where he lives, and setting up the first England team, raising money to attend the first World B Championship in 2015. But raising the profile of the sport has not been easy, with Pimblett and his club-mates needing to travel at least two hours in order to train on a suitable ice sheet. Pimblett also makes regular journeys to train with the rest of the British squad at the National Curling Academy in Stirling. \"Traditionally, wheelchair curling has been a Scottish sport and it has been challenging to develop it in England,\" he said. \"But we are an ageing sport and we have to look further afield to try to get more players from all over the country involved. \"I'm very proud to be involved in that and hopefully driving the sport forward. \"If I'm honest, I wish I had stopped playing wheelchair basketball and taken up wheelchair curling 10 years earlier. \"It's a very hard sport and is mentally challenging, but it is brilliant. I loved wheelchair basketball more than anything but now wheelchair curling has taken that place.\"  The sport made its Paralympic debut in 2006, where Britain won silver, before earning bronze in Sochi in 2014. For Milan-Cortina, the programme will also feature a mixed doubles event alongside the team competition. In South Korea, Pimblett will partner newcomer Karen Aspey, who made her international debut in the team event at last year's World B Championships. Scotland, who accrue Paralympic qualification points on behalf of Great Britain at major championships, will be represented by Charlotte McKenna and Gary Smith.  Pimblett narrowly missed out on the semi-finals last year, when he played alongside Commonwealth Games bowling gold medallist Rosemary Lenton, but is excited about the new pairing with Aspey as they gear up for round-robin games against Canada, Finland, Italy, Slovenia, Switzerland and the United States. \"I don't know how we will do but with a bit of luck, who knows?\" he says.  \"We would like to get to the play-offs. After that, anything is possible. I want to go there and enjoy it and not push pressure on ourselves.\""

        "text": " Olivia Newman-Baronius equalled the S14 100m butterfly world record in her first major event to all but confirm her place at this summer's Paralympics. The 17-year-old said the Games were not on her radar three weeks ago before she swam at a World Series event in Italy. But on Saturday she put in the joint-fastest time in history in her classification - one minute 3.33 seconds - to win the British title. \"I couldn't really believe it,\" the teenager said. \"I couldn't see the board, I just heard it.\" Newman-Baronius won four medals on her Great Britain debut in Italy in March, but the Aquatics GB Swimming Championships are her biggest championships to date. She has met the Paralympic nomination time in four events at the London Aquatics Centre - the 200m freestyle, 100m backstroke, 200m individual medley, plus the 100m butterfly - and her first title effectively rubberstamps her place for this summer's European Championships and the Paralympics that follow. \"I didn't get diagnosed with autism until October last year,\" she said. \"This [racing at the Paralympics] hadn't occurred to me until I was in Italy that it was possible.\" In the battle for Olympic qualification, Ben Proud put in the third-fastest 50m freestyle title of his career to give him a shot at an elusive Olympic medal in Paris. The 29-year-old has won medals at every major championships bar the Olympics, including world bronze this year and the 2022 world title. He finished in 21.25 seconds in London, with Matt Richards also under the qualification time after winning the 100m freestyle earlier in the week. \"Clearly I would love to have the whole collection but I have put myself through hell trying to get that Olympic medal,\" Proud said. \"You have to dream, you have to want it. But you don't have to need it.\" In the final race of the night, Abbie Wood produced a personal best in the 200m individual medley to comfortably clear the qualification time for Paris.  Her effort of 2:08.91 would have won bronze at this year's world championships in Doha. \"I just want to be as competitive as I was at the last Olympics because it is always more fun when you are in the mix,\" said the 25-year-old, who reached the final of the event in Tokyo three years ago. Elsewhere, Toby Robinson, who will compete in the open water events in Paris, swam a personal best to win the 800m freestyle title but was outside the required time for Olympic qualification. Similarly, James Wilby won the men's 200m breaststroke and Keanna MacInnes the women's 100m butterfly but missed times for Paris, although MacInnes has already qualified in the 200m event. Tully Kearney swam a British record in the women's para 50m backstroke and, along with silver medallist Ellie Challis, made the nomination time to put herself in contention for the Paralympics. Brock Whiston won her second event of the week, the para 200m medley. The S8 swimmer made the nomination time, as did S6 Paralympic champion and world record holder Maisie Summers-Newton and S14 swimmer Poppy Maskill. Scot Stephen Clegg won his fourth title of the meet in the para 50m freestyle. He did not make the nomination time for Paris but is already all but confirmed to travel to the Paralympics thanks to his other events."

However, Hug had enough left in the tank to drop his competitors in the second half of the race to win comfortably. \"It was a really amazing race but it was also really tough.

        "text": " Oliver Morgan capped a remarkable rise by breaking the British 100m backstroke record to qualify for the Paris Olympics. Morgan, 20, was not on the radar at the elite level until he won three titles at the British Championships last year. He defended his 100m crown on Wednesday in a time of 52.70 seconds to better Liam Tancock's record from 2009. \"If you asked me two years ago if I would be in this position I'd have said there's no way,\" Morgan said. \"I can't put it into words.\" Elsewhere, 14-year-old Amelie Blocksidge defended her 1500m freestyle title but her effort of 16 minutes 13.39 at London Aquatics Centre was outside the Olympic qualification time. Scotland's Kathleen Dawson, a relay gold medallist from the Tokyo Games, did qualify for Paris by winning the 100m backstroke after three years dogged by injury. Alice Tai impressively won a hotly-contested 100m Para-backstroke event to put herself in a strong position for qualification for the Paralympics.   Morgan, from Ludlow, did not start competing nationally until the age of 16, with his rise beginning after he began to take the sport more seriously while training at the University of Birmingham. \"It proves you don't have to be there as a youngster,\" he said. \"I did what I enjoyed when I was young. I played football and mountain biked. \"We didn't have the facilities [at Ludlow compared to major swimming centres] and the pool time. You have to adapt.\" Morgan went under 53 seconds for the first time in the morning heats with a time of 52.87 and bettered that in a stacked final. Jonathon Marshall was also under the Olympic qualification time of 52.73 but had to settle for second, although that should be enough for him to qualify for the Games, while Tokyo bronze medallist Luke Greenbank finished third. Dawson won gold in the mixed 4x100m medley relay in Tokyo while competing with a back injury. That turned out to be a bulging disc which caused sciatica and in the period since she has \"questioned whether I wanted to be in this sport any more\". Her time of 59.81 in the heats was her first time under 60 seconds since 2021 and a 59.74 in the final secured her Olympic return. \"I am so unbelievably grateful for the people who have got me back to this point,\" she said. \"It has been a big test of my mental character. There have been a lot of times I could have chucked it in.\" Tai competed at the Rio Paralympics in 2016 but missed Tokyo because of injury. Since then she has had her right leg amputated to improve her quality of life.  She is targeting five events at the Paralympics with Wednesday's backstroke win her first event of these championships, back at the venue where she won six world titles in 2019. \"In the pool I am proud of myself but outside of the pool this is the first time in my life since my amputation that I have had my independence,\" she said. \"It [her amputation] was a big decision to make and I am proud I went through with it. I am the happiest I have been outside of the pool.\" Poppy Maskill finished second and Olivia Newman-Baronius third and they, like fourth-placed Megan Neave and fifth-placed Georgia Sheffield, also made the Paralympic nomination time in the S14 category to put themselves in contention for the Games. Tai on Paralympic hopes and drive to 'destigmatise' disability Teenager Blocksidge looks to be one of the future stars of British swimming having successfully defended the title she won on her 14th birthday last year. She required a new personal best to make the Olympic time of 16 minutes 01.95 - her own best stands at 16:10.04 - but she finished just over 11 seconds adrift. Elsewhere, Stephen Clegg won the men's 100m Para-backstroke title and finished well inside the Paralympic time. Kara Hanlon won the women's 200m breaststroke and Joshua Gammon the men's 200m butterfly but both were outside of the Olympic marks."

Asked if he is back to his best, the three-time Olympic champion, 29, said: \"I think so.\" He added: \"A 57.9 is very good, still not where I want to be, but the first solid result where I am like, 'Oh not many people can do this'.\" Faith has helped deal with mental battles - Peaty MacInnes amazed at 'incredible' GB title upset World-record holder Peaty was unbeaten over 100m for eight years from 2014, but he has experienced more difficult times since becoming the first British swimmer to successfully defend an Olympic title in Tokyo. He finished fourth in the 2022 Commonwealth Games after breaking his foot and stepped away from the sport for much of 2023 to prioritise his mental health, saying he had been in a \"self-destructive spiral\". On his return to major championships in February he had to settle for world bronze in Doha but a time of 58.53 seconds in the heats on Tuesday would have been enough for gold in those World Championships, and he went even faster in the evening's final. It was the quickest 100m breaststroke since China's Qin Haiyang, who is expected to be a rival for Peaty at this summer's Olympics, won the 2023 world championships in a time of 57.69. \"I felt so light in the water,\" he said. \"This is a real win for my team, my family and myself. We have come through the past three years of hell.  \"I didn't want to see a pool again. The sport had broken me. \"I didn't know what route to go down and so many things got in my way, but now I am waking up each day and enjoying my job.  \"Who knows what the ending is going to be but I am having fun along the way. \"It may not end up as a fairytale, but it might...\" The winner of each event at this week's championships effectively secures one of two Olympics places for each event, as long as the swimmer matches the qualification time. Commonwealth champion James Wilby took silver behind Peaty but his time was 0.02secs outside the Olympic qualification time. Elsewhere, Keanna MacInnes produced a shock in the 200m butterfly by pipping 2024 world champion Laura Stephens to secure her place. She won the title in a Scottish record time of two minutes 7.24secs, but with Stephens also under the qualification time 0.13secs behind both are likely to compete in France.  Freya Colbert won the 200m freestyle but said she is unlikely to race the event in Paris because of a clash with the 400m individual medley - which she won at the World Championships earlier this year. Colbert's win secured her a place on the 4x200m relay team while Abbie Wood was also under the qualification time in second, meaning she is likely to race the event at the Olympics. Kieran Bird swam a lifetime best to win the men's 400m freestyle but his effort of 3:45.63 was an agonising 0.2secs outside the Olympic qualifying time. The British championships are also fully integrated with the Para events, though Paralympic qualification takes a different format. Swimmers compete in mixed-classification races, then they are ranked in relation to their times to select a full squad. In a competitive women's 200m Para-freestyle race, five swimmers - Poppy Maskill, Olivia Newman-Baronius, Louise Fiddes, Jessica-Jane Applegate and Suzanna Hext - were all under the qualification time. Maskill took the title to put herself in pole position for a place in Paris. Elsewhere in the Para-swimming events, Sam Downie won the 400m freestyle title, Grace Harvey the 50m butterfly, Lyndon Longhorne the 150m individual medley and Harry Stewart the 100m breaststroke, although all four were outside the initial qualification time for the Paralympics."

        "text": " After missing the Tokyo Paralympics, Para-swimmer Brock Whiston says she wants to put the tough times behind her and secure her place at the Paris Games. The 27-year-old goes in this week's British Swimming Championships at the London Aquatics Centre - a special venue for her - hoping for performances to put her in line for selection.  Not only does Whiston do one of her weekly training sessions in the pool, back in 2019 she made her Great Britain debut there at the World Para Swimming Championships, bursting on to the scene by winning golds in the 100m breaststroke and 200m medley - both in world record times - and helping GB to two relay titles. Issues around her eligibility and category meant the Londoner was unable to compete in the Tokyo Paralympics in 2021 and the 2022 Commonwealth Games in Birmingham. \"I couldn't even watch the Games on television,\" she said. \"I considered giving up but I love swimming and the challenge. \"It has made me a stronger athlete and more determined to get the qualifying times and go to Paris to thank all of those who supported me on the way. \"If it had been an easy journey it wouldn't have made me who I am.\" As a youngster, Whiston was frequently accused of being 'lazy'. She struggled with her co-ordination, crawling with just her right leg while her left leg dragged and she would trip over it when she was tired. As she got older she started to struggle more with her physicality and also suffered frequent shoulder dislocations, puzzling doctors before eventually being diagnosed with hemiplegia - which causes weakness and paralysis - on her left-hand side. \"It was a relief when someone finally explained why I was finding some things hard,\" she says. \"As you are growing, you can compensate for things - and that is what I did - but it is harder to adapt as you get older.\" The dislocations still happen on a regular basis - with one even occurring during one of Whiston's finals at last year's World Championships in Manchester.  \"It happens in most of my training sessions, I could be lying-in, watching television, and it will happen,\" she explains.  \"My mum knows how to put it back in place now, so do I, so does my boyfriend and my coach. Sometimes it just will keep sliding in and out, it depends how fatigued I am.  \"Everyone on the British team knows I love napping and can do three or four hours at a time. But that is what I need to be able to perform in the pool. \"At one point I considered having my arm amputated but I was told that was too dangerous an operation. \"Doctors also tried to fix it in place but when they put the shoulder in the position it should be in, it caused me so much pain that I couldn't cope.\" Swimming was always part of Whiston's life and she took part in non-disabled competition throughout her younger years. Back in 2012, she was among the crowds at the London Paralympics, cheering on Ellie Simmonds to gold before she realised that she too could follow in Simmonds' footsteps as a Para-swimmer. She obtained her international classification in 2018. Her coach, Stewart Nicklin at the Barking and Dagenham club, has been key to her success and they are constantly learning from each other to get the best results. \"We work hard together - sometimes when I think I can't do it, he just tells me to get on with it,\" she says.  \"There are times when my hands won't work properly at the end of a session and I am exhausted, and my coach has to take my goggles and hat off and give me my drinks bottle.\" Whiston started her career in the S8 category before being moved to the S9 category, where she competed against less-impaired rivals. After going through classification again earlier this year, she is back as an S8., external Despite the changes, she says she remains focused on her own race and performance and starts her bid for Paris with the 400m freestyle on Friday, the 100m butterfly and 200m medley on Saturday and the 100m breaststroke and 100m freestyle on Sunday. \"There are some greats in both categories but at the end of day you are just there to do what you can do and race your own race,\" she says. \"Classification is done on observation and what the classifiers perceive you to be, and you are scored in and out of the pool. \"People can agree with it or disagree with it but it is the system. There will always be a variation of impairments within a class but you just have to get on with it and be grateful that you are in a position where you can still swim.\" Who are the new Posh & Becks?

The Commonwealth Games marathon silver medallist triumphed in a time of one hour 35 minutes 11 seconds. She is the first British woman to win the wheelchair race and the first Briton to win any of Boston's elite races since Geoff Smith in 1985. \"I really can't believe this,\" said the 22-year-old. \"I was was just focusing on my own race. I had absolutely nothing left at the end, but the crowd carried me through.\" Rainbow-Cooper won the women's wheelchair race at the Great North Run in September 2022 and has been improving over the marathon distance, coming second in Berlin last September and in Tokyo in March. She is set to continue her preparations for this summer's Paralympics in Paris by competing at the London Marathon this Sunday.

Ethiopia's Sisay Lemma won the elite men's race for the first time in 2:06:17 - 41 seconds ahead of compatriot Mohamed Esa Lemma, 33, hit the front early and led by more than two minutes at the halfway mark, while Esa made a late surge to overtake Kenyan pair John Korir and Evans Chebet and finish a second ahead of two-time defending champion Chebet. Kenyan Hellen Obiri pulled away in the final mile to claim a second straight women's title in 2:22:37. The 34-year-old finished eight seconds ahead of compatriot Sharon Lokedi, while veteran Edna Kiplagat was third to complete a Kenyan podium sweep."

        "text": " As the six-month countdown to the Paris 2024 Paralympics begins, we've put together a guide to everything you need to know about the Games. Paris will be hosting the Paralympics for the first time in 2024 in what will be a sporting spectacular. About 4,400 athletes from across the world will take part in 22 sports cheered on by crowds again after the rescheduled Tokyo Games in 2021 was held behind closed doors. As well as the performances, the competitors will also be aiming to help change attitudes and lead the way in driving social change in France and further afield. The Paralympic Games will begin on Wednesday, 28 August with the opening ceremony. For the first time, it will be held outside a stadium and during the ceremony athletes will parade by some of the French capital's most iconic landmarks, located along the route between the Champs-Elysees and the Place de la Concorde. Organisers have placed inclusion at the heart of the Games and spectators will be able to watch along the route before the official parade and formalities take place in front of ticket-holders at the Place de la Concorde. A total of 23 gold medals will be decided on the opening day of competition, Thursday, 29 August. The final day of the Games will be Sunday, 8 September and, as well as the closing ceremony, will feature medal events in wheelchair basketball, powerlifting, Para-canoe and the Para-marathon events in the athletics. Many of the venues being utilised at the Olympics will also stage Paralympic events. Wheelchair tennis will be hosted at Roland Garros, the picturesque Chateau de Versailles garden will be the venue for the Para-equestrian events while the Stade de France will host the Para-athletics programme. The Grand Palais, normally a venue for art and sport events, will host wheelchair fencing and Para-taekwondo while the blind football competition will be in a specially built stadium at the foot of the iconic Eiffel Tower. And the Para-triathletes will be competing through the centre of Paris with the swim element due to take place in the River Seine. Channel 4 will show the Games in the United Kingdom. There will also be extensive coverage on BBC Radio 5 Live and the BBC Sport website. Unlike the past two editions of the Games where Para-triathlon and Para-canoe (Rio) and Para-taekwondo and Para-badminton (Tokyo) made their debuts, there are no new sports included in the Paris programme. However, the badminton and taekwondo programmes have been expanded and there are also a record number of medal events for women.  549 gold medals will be up for grabs across 22 sports. ParalympicsGB will compete in 19 sports in Paris having failed to qualify in blind football, goalball and sitting volleyball. No-one has yet been officially named on the GB team but it is expected that it will feature about 220 athletes. In Tokyo, Great Britain finished second in the medal table behind China with 124 medals, including 41 golds. Athletes from Russia and Belarus will be allowed to compete at the Games as neutrals.  Both nations had been suspended from Paralympic competition since Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. At the following month's Winter Paralympics in Beijing, competitors from both countries were not allowed to take part as neutrals after the International Paralympic Committee (IPC) was criticised for originally saying they could. In September 2023, the IPC voted to lift the full ban and partially suspend the national Paralympic committees of Russia and Belarus. It means competitors from both nations can take part in Paris as neutrals. The decision was criticised by a number of international federations, including ParalympicsGB. Previously, Russian athletes had been barred from the 2016 Rio Paralympics over historic doping allegations before athletes were able to compete under a neutral flag and using the initials of the Russian Paralympic Committee at both the 2018 Winter Games in Pyeongchang and at Tokyo 2020."

        "text": " Frankie Dettori rode six consecutive winners at Santa Anita in California on Saturday evening. The victories came at cumulative odds of more than 77,000-1.  Dettori famously rode a 'Magnificent Seven' of all winners on the card at Ascot in September 1996 at odds of over 25,000-1. \"I adore this place and to be able to say that I won six races on Derby day is beyond my wildest dreams,\" said the 53-year-old Italian. \"I don't know how to put it into words. Is it real? Am I dreaming? Is this really happening? It's incredible. I just don't know what to say.\" Dettori, who has ridden more than 3,300 career winners after being based in the UK for much of that time, delayed his retirement plans last year to ride on in the United States. His six winners won at odds of 9-4, 6-1, 12-1, 9-2, 10-1 and 10-3. The biggest success came in the Grade Two Santa Anita Oaks aboard 10-1 shot Nothing Like You. Dettori had 11 rides in all, missing out on victory in his first race, before six consecutive wins. He was then second on 5-4 favourite Imagination in the Grade One Santa Anita Derby. \"He's just a phenomenon,\" Nothing Like You trainer Bob Baffert said of Dettori. \"He is world-class and has brought his talent to every stage.\" The record for most wins for a jockey on one US card was set in 2005 when Eddie Castro won with nine of his 11 rides. Santa Anita's record for most victories by a jockey at one meeting is seven - for Laffit Pincay Jr in March 1987. Leading jump jockey Aidan Coleman has retired aged 35 on medical grounds. He suffered a serious knee injury when his mount Ascension Day ran out and crashed through the wing of a hurdle at Worcester last June. Coleman had a long association with the popular racehorse Paisley Park, and won the Stayers' Hurdle at Cheltenham with him in 2019. The Irishman also won the Champion Chase with Put The Kettle On in 2021, although he missed out on 100-1 Grand National winner Mon Mome in 2009 after choosing to ride stablemate Stan. The incident at Worcester left him with a shattered tibia and a complex recovery process has led him to quit the sport.  Speaking on Racing TV's Luck on Sunday programme, the jockey said: \"The prognosis early was quite bleak about returning to ride. Around September I was kidding myself that I could get back from this, then around Christmas I had another operation and the progress has really plateaued. \"I can do the gym, but I can't run or jump. I can't ride a horse really. A lot of people would say I couldn't anyway so what's the difference but every time I've tried to ride a horse since Christmas it's not gone well. I just can't really do it or ride in a race or anything.\" Coleman rode more than 1,200 winners in Britain and Ireland, including top-level Grade One victories with Jonbon and Epatante."

Surrey Quest (20-1), ridden by Toby Lawes, was just pipped on the line following a late push.

The Irishman is now in pole position to be named champion jumps trainer with one week of the season remaining.  Macdermott's jockey Danny Mullins, Willie's nephew, timed his charge perfectly, overtaking pre-race favourite Mr Vango four fences out before holding off Surrey Quest in the closing straight.

Willie Mullins eyes British title Jamie Snowden's Git Maker - the lowest-priced finisher at 8-1 - came third while Mullins-trained Klarc Kent (50-1), Ontheropes (66-1) and Spanish Harlem (12-1) finished fourth, fifth and sixth respectively.  Ballygrifincottage (16-1), trained by Dan Skelton, Mullins' closest challenger for the champion trainer title, was seventh.  Despite picking up so many places in the biggest remaining race of the jump season, Willie Mullins was not ready to celebrate victory just yet as he bids to become Ireland's first British champion trainer in 70 years.  \"I am delighted Danny did it, it's fantastic,\" he said. \"[There is a] bit to go yet, but we are involved in it and it looks very good.\"  Danny Mullins was equally circumspect about his uncle's chances, adding: \"It's far from over.

Eldorado Allen, from the Somerset-based trainer, is one of only five English entries out of the 34 runners in Saturday's race.

It's as simple as that and there are a lot of them in Ireland.  \"It's swings and roundabouts, it's something that as English trainers we're conscious of and everybody's looking at it.\" He told BBC Radio Somerset: \"If you look at the Cheltenham results and what horses ran there and what horses ran in the stay and chasers there I think next year the tide will turn a little bit.  \"I wouldn't say it's an immediate thing, there'll still be a lot of Irish horses, but I think there'll be more British horses next year.\" Tizzard finished fifth in the Grand National during his 18-year career as a jockey and his horse Fiddlerontheroof finish fifth in the race in 2022. Eldorado Allen won the Denan Chase in 2022 and finished fourth in the Coral Gold Cup in December but pulled up at Cheltenham Festival last month. \"It's a race we've talked about with Eldorado Allen all season,\" Tizzard said.  \"If he gets a bit of luck and running and he hunts away and creeps into it then who's to say when they cross the Melling Road he won't be there with a chance.  \"It would be unbelievable - I feel privileged to be part of this huge race, I feel privilege that we've got a horse good enough to run in it.\""

        "text": " Jonbon completed a treble for owner JP McManus on day two of the Grand National meeting at Aintree. The win in the Melling Chase came after earlier victories for Inothewayurthinkin and Mystical Power. Jonbon, trained by Nicky Henderson, had been withdrawn from last month's Cheltenham Festival amid concerns over the stable's form. \"It has been two months of hell,\" jockey Nico de Boinville told ITV Racing. \"We have had to sit and suffer but I'm delighted the yard have bounced back to something this week.\" Jonbon had been a leading fancy for the Queen Mother Champion Chase but was one of several Henderson runners who were pulled out of Cheltenham after a disappointing start to the meeting for the Seven Barrows trainer. But the 11-10 chance, running over two and a half miles for the first time, got the better of his rivals to follow stable-mate Sir Gino's victory on the opening day of the Liverpool meeting. Grand National runners and riders Corach Rambler seeks repeat National win Impaire Et Passe survives stewards inquiry Conflated had led taking the second-last but Jonbon rallied and edged ahead at the last and although Conflated and Protektorat tried to chase him down, he held on. \"He had to be brave,\" said De Boinville. \"He jumped great, apart from the last. He is a classy animal and very versatile.\" Jonbon has been the mount of Aidan Coleman in recent seasons. De Boinville stepped in after Coleman sustained what proved to be a career-ending knee injury last June. \"I'd like to give a special mention to Aidan because it would have been his ride this season. I wish him all the best in his retirement,\" De Boinville added. \"Days like these are very special so you've got to celebrate and enjoy them,\" said McManus, who has five runners in Saturday's big race - the well-fancied trio of I Am Maximus, Limerick Lace and Meetingofthewaters along with Capodanno and Janadil. \"Jonbon winning meant a lot because it has been a trying time for Nicky over the past two months so to see him up there, you could see it was special to him.\" Later, Paul Townend, who is set to ride I Am Maximus, was denied victory on his horse James Du Berlais when Arizona Cardinal struck late to win the Topham Handicap Chase over the National fences. There were plenty in with chances as they approached the final fence, and Townend headed to the elbow in front but Arizona Cardinal, ridden by Ciaran Gethings and trained by Stuart Edmunds, finished the better to win at 20-1. Two horses died at Aintree on Friday. The Lucinda Russell-trained Giovinco was put down after a fall at the final fence in the Mildmay Novices' Chase at the start of the day. Pikar, trained by Dan Skelton, was fatally injured in a fall at the second-last in the Alder Hey Handicap Hurdle, the day's final race. Aintree Racecourse said it sent \"heartfelt condolences\" to connections of the horses. Animal rights activists said safety changes at the course do not go far enough."

        "text": " I Am Maximus stormed clear to win the Grand National for jockey Paul Townend and trainer Willie Mullins. The 7-1 joint favourite triumphed by seven and a half lengths at Aintree from runner-up Delta Work, with Minella Indo third and Galvin fourth. \"What an unbelievable race and unbelievable horse,\" said Townend. There was early drama in the famous race as last year's winner Corach Rambler unseated jockey Derek Fox at the first fence. Mullins eyes British title after Grand National win What happened to your horse? Mac Tottie, who was pulled up, was treated by vets but was cleared to return to trainer Peter Bowen's yard. There were no concerns about any other runners. Of the 32 starters, 21 horses completed the race - the highest number across the finish line since 1992. Rachael Blackmore looked like she might secure a second National win as Minella Indo challenged, while Kitty's Light finished fifth for Welsh trainer Christian Williams, whose young daughter Betsy is being treated for leukaemia. Sixth went to amateur jockey David Maxwell, riding Ain't That A Shame, a horse he bought earlier this year and a purchase which enabled him to ride in the race for the first time. But it was the team of Mullins, Townend and owner JP McManus who triumphed as I Am Maximus led home an Irish 1-2-3-4. At the 13th attempt, Townend claimed his first National win while it was a second for Mullins after Hedgehunter in 2005 and McManus' third triumph following Don't Push It (2010) and Minella Times (2021). It follows last month's Cheltenham wins for Townend and Mullins in the Champion Hurdle with State Man and Galopin Des Champs' successful Gold Cup defence. The other 7-1 joint-favourite, Limerick Lace, also owned by McManus, was hoping to become the first mare to win the race since Nickel Coin in 1951, but made a couple of early mistakes and drifted to the back of the field, eventually finishing 10th. Victory means Mullins is now favourite to win the British trainers' championship, which concludes at the end of this month. \"Aintree is the first race you see, it's the first race everyone in racing wants to see. Fantastic stuff, you just couldn't make it up,\" said Mullins. Last year's race had been delayed by 14 minutes after animal rights activists entered the track, but there was no disruption this time. The number of runners had been reduced from a maximum of 40 following a safety review. Other safety measures included a standing start for the race, which went off at the first time of asking, a reduction in height to one of the fences and added foam and rubber toe boards on every fence. In one of the most competitive renewals for some time, there were plenty still in with chances as they approached the final couple of fences. Loose horse Mahler Mission, who had earlier unseated rider Ben Harvey, threatened to cause problems for those at the head of the field, but luckily all were able to run their race. It all changed at the elbow as I Am Maximus went past Minella Indo and once Townend and his mount took the lead they powered home. \"The feeling passing the line is up there with the best I've had, but it's a different feeling,\" he said. \"Grade Ones are extra special and tactical and in the Irish National and English National you need a bit of luck, the feeling winning this is unique.\" Elsewhere on Saturday's card, Gordon Elliott, who trained runner-up Delta Work and fourth-placed Galvin in the Grand National, and jockey Jack Kennedy had a double. First, his talented mare Brighterdaysahead bounced back from defeat at the Cheltenham Festival with a comfortable win in the Turners Mersey Novices' Hurdle. She had headed to Prestbury Park as one of the bankers of the week in the Mares' Novices' Hurdle but finished second to Golden Ace. However, back up in trip and despite facing some tough opposition, the 6-5 favourite finished seven and a half lengths clear of Staffordshire Knot. Later, Kennedy and Elliott combined again as the 11-8 favourite Found A Fifty rallied late on to edge past Master Chewy and take the Maghull Novices Chase. There was also an impressive win for Strong Leader in the Liverpool Hurdle, justifying trainer Olly Murphy's decision to skip the Stayers' Hurdle at Cheltenham. The 8-1 chance and jockey Sean Bowen came to the front jumping the last and went on to win by four and a quarter lengths.

        "text": " Jockey Stefano Cherchi has died aged 23 two weeks after being hurt in a fall. The Sardinian, who previously rode in Britain, fell during a meeting at Canberra, Australia. His girlfriend Brittany, daughter of legendary former jockey Kieren Fallon, had travelled to be at his bedside. \"With deep sadness, the Cherchi family have announced their beloved son Stefano passed away peacefully today,\" said the New South Wales Jockeys Association. \"The family are very grateful for the love, prayers and messages sent by the racing community across the world.\" The rider was placed in intensive care with a serious head injury after his mount fell during a race at Canberra on 20 March. Cherchi's horse Hasime came down in an incident that involved two other horses. While the other two riders and all of the horses avoided injury, Cherchi was attended to by medics on the track for about an hour before being taken to hospital with a head injury and internal bleeding. Cherchi, who had been an apprentice jockey with Newmarket trainer Marco Botti, rode more than 100 winners in Britain before relocating to Australia at the start of the year. \"Today is an absolutely heartbreaking day for us all but Stefano will always be with us. His charming character and smile can never be forgotten,\" said Botti. \"Our thoughts are with the Cherchi family and his close friends.\" The rider was \"much loved and will be missed\" said the Professional Jockeys Association. \"As well as being a gifted rider, Stefano was immensely popular in the weighing room due to his humility, kindness and sense of humour,\" it said. Leading jockey Hollie Doyle posted on X: \"Stefano will be sorely missed, he was one of the good guys.\"  The British Horseracing Authority said Cherchi was held in high esteem around the world. \"The entire racing industry will be in mourning after the loss of such a talented young man,\" it added."

        "text": " Paul Townend and Impaire Et Passe survived a stewards inquiry to take victory in the Aintree Hurdle on the opening day of the Liverpool track's Grand National meeting. The evens favourite beat Rachael Blackmore's mount Bob Olinger and Langer Dan, ridden by Harry Skelton, in a photo finish. The stewards inquiry was called after interference in the latter stages. But after deliberations, the result remained unchanged. Grand National runners and riders: Pinstickers' Guide Corach Rambler heads Grand National contenders Aintree racecards and results Impaire Et Passe appeared to cross Langer Dan's path after the last. Bob Olinger also seemed to drift inwards on the run to the line, leaving Langer Dan sandwiched between them. Townend's horse, trained by Willie Mullins, won it by a nose from Bob Olinger with Langer Dan a further short head back in third. \"It was a long wait but I was pretty confident we'd keep it once I'd seen the overhead angle - I thought that gave us a great chance,\" said Mullins. \"When Paul and Harry crossed after the last hurdle, there was never any interference and I thought it would be hard to change it.  \"On balance it was a hard result to change as Paul thought he was idling in front, which is a legitimate excuse.\" Earlier, the favourite Gerri Colombe held off the challenge of Ahoy Senor to win the William Hill Bowl.  The 9-4 chance, ridden by Jack Kennedy, finished second in last month's Cheltenham Gold Cup.  The Gordon Elliott-trained horse jumped into contention at the second last and took the last alongside Ahoy Senor. He then showed his strength on the run-in to win by half a length. \"Jack said the horse was never happy the whole way, but it shows the guts he has,\" Elliott told ITV Racing. \"He was probably at the front too soon but he did what he had to do and we are lucky to have him. \"It is all systems go for the Gold Cup next year.\" Earlier, there was relief for trainer Nicky Henderson after unbeaten juvenile Sir Gino won the Juvenile Hurdle. Henderson had a difficult time at Cheltenham with the disappointing performances of several horses leading him to withdraw a number of others, including Sir Gino. But although Sir Gino made errors at the third-last and second-last, he picked up well on the run-in to win by three and a quarter lengths. Henderson said: \"We knew what we were walking into and while it is a relief, one swallow doesn't make a summer as they say. \"All trainers know what a spell like we've had is like, the problem we had was the timing, unfortunately it was more public than was probably necessary because we literally bumped into Cheltenham.\" Amateur rider Derek O'Connor had an impressive win on Its On The Line in the Foxhunters Chase over the Grand National fences - his second win in the race, but first over the modified course. The horse is trained by Emmet Mullins, the nephew of Willie Mullins and trainer of 2022 Grand National winner Noble Yeats who will bid to regain his crown on Saturday. Bryony Frost guided home the Paul Nicholls-trained Sans Bruit for a comfortable success over the 9-2 favourite Saint Roi in the Close Brothers Red Rum Handicap Chase. Frost, 28, admitted afterwards that her lack of recent riding opportunities have had an impact on her. \"There have been parts of the season where it has been like pushing water up the hill, but you can't sit down and cry about it,\" she said. \"For me there is a frustration when you feel you have so much to offer, but you can only deal with the opportunities you are getting. I'm thankful for everyone they get whether they come in quickly, or months apart, but I try and make the most of them when I get them.  \"Today I was given the opportunity by the home team, and Sans Bruit's owners, and it is just fantastic to give them a big winner when they have the confidence to give you that opportunity.  \"I'm not riding this Saturday [in the Grand National], and there is frustration of course there is, as you are in the game to win, and you want to ride, and be out there, but there is nothing you can do about it but just work hard.\" Frost, who created history in 2019 by becoming the first female jockey to win a Grade One race at the Cheltenham Festival, was backed by Nicholls. \"Bryony probably doesn't get the opportunities she deserves in Britain,\" he said. \"It's hard for her but not just for Bryony, there are lots of good jockeys who don't get all the opportunities.  \"Obviously Harry [Cobden] is our first jockey, and I'd encourage her to go to France, as she's suggested, and go from May until October, get rides, we're not going to be busy, and come back in October. It can only be good for her.\""

        "text": " Willie Mullins is targeting the British trainers' title after the Irishman won the Grand National with I Am Maximus. He would be only the second Irish trainer to claim the jumps championship after Vincent O'Brien, who secured the prize for a second time 70 years ago. The \u00c2\u00a3500,000 National pot means Mullins leads British rivals Dan Skelton and Paul Nicholls with two weeks to go. \"I would love to win the British championship, it would be something different,\" said Mullins. He said the 2023 Irish National winner I Am Maximus would be aimed at the Cheltenham Gold Cup next year after an imperious seven-and-a-half-length victory from runner-up Delta Work. Relive the race as it happened Report: I Am Maximus wins the National What happened to your horse? Rachael Blackmore was third on Minella Indo with Galvin fourth in an Irish 1-2-3-4. Kitty's Light finished fifth for Welsh trainer Christian Williams, whose young daughter Betsy is being treated for leukaemia. \"I thought we had a chance. A long way out he was travelling sweet and jumping well. I was trying to be calm, but I was getting quite excited. He's a wonderful horse - he's great. We're very lucky to have him,\" said Williams. Amateur rider David Maxwell finished sixth on Ain't That A Shame, a horse the real estate entrepreneur bought so he could ride in the race. Another month, another landmark looms for Mullins. In March, he claimed the Champion Hurdle and Gold Cup and became the first trainer to reach 100 Cheltenham Festival winners. April brought a second National win, after Hedgehunter in 2005, and he is now favourite with bookmakers to emulate his legendary compatriot O'Brien by claiming the British championship. \"Sandown, Ayr, Perth, wherever we can see a prize - I think we have to go for it now,\" he said.  \"We needed to have a really good National and we got it. It's game on I think, isn't it?\" While Irish champion Mullins has a fraction of the British winners secured by Skelton and Nicholls, the title is decided on prize money and he has bagged many of the biggest prizes. Mullins is more than \u00c2\u00a350,000 ahead of Skelton, with Nicholls further back in third. Asked if he could have envisaged such success this season, Mullins said: \"I would have thought you were mad. \"We are gobsmacked looking at the talent in the yard.\" The maximum number of runners in the National was cut to 34 from 40 following a safety review and 32 runners went to post after two withdrawals. A standing start to slow runners down going to the first was among other changes. These came after Hill Sixteen suffered a fatal injury in last year's race, which was delayed by 14 minutes after animal rights activists entered the track. All these changes have cemented the changing nature of the Grand National - 21 of the 32 horses completed the race, and there were no fallers, with four horses unseating their riders and seven pulled up. The course is easier to negotiate, less of a lottery - this was the first time since 1894 the favourite, or joint favourite, won successive editions. While two horses died over the three-day meeting, there were no equine fatalities in the big race and two other contests over the National fences. There was drama from the start, with last year's winner Corach Rambler unseating jockey Derek Fox at the first fence. And the amount of contenders in the latter stages of the second circuit still provided plenty of excitement and intrigue.  \"What was great to watch was the space all of the riders gave each other,\" two-time National-winning jockey Ruby Walsh told ITV. \"I do approve of the changes and Aintree have put a lot of work into it.\" On the trip of a lifetime, which pair will finish first?

JJ Slevin kept the Tom Gibney trained Intense Raffles (13-2) close in behind early leader Frontal Assault before moving to the front. Intense Raffles opened a gap but a strong finish from Any Second Now (14-1) saw him win by just a length. Minella Cocooner (20-1) came in third with Frontal Assault (25-1) fourth. It was a second Irish Grand National victory for Slevin and Gibney while the Simon Munir and Isaac Souede-owned French import Intense Raffles won for the second time at Fairyhouse.  Intense Raffles looked good throughout, with the six-year-old grey tucking in behind Frontal Assault before hitting the front two out. He stayed on gamely to deny the fast-finishing Any Second Now and Minella Cocooner. \"He's a fantastic horse and it's easy to train good horses like that,\" said Gibney. \"Last February was the first time I spoke to them (Munir and Souede) and fair play to the boys. \"It's very easy for the big owners to go to the big yards, so for them to pick out a small stable like us and give us a horse, kudos to them. That takes a bit of doing and it's great to repay them. \"When he won here the last time we were just getting to know him and it's just fallen into place. I could make out like I'm a genius but I'm not really, it's just the way it worked out - it worked out well. \"I had huge confidence in the horse. People were asking me if I was nervous and hand on my heart I wasn't because we had huge confidence in him. He's the best I've had.\""

The 43-year-old Irishman, who won the Cheltenham Gold Cup in 2010 on Imperial Commander, ended his career with victory on Manofthepeople. Brennan had more than 1,500 wins, including big races with Cue Card and the 2007 World Hurdle on Inglis Drever. Imperial Commander upset racing greats Kauto Star and Denman when winning the Gold Cup. Brennan was stable jockey to Fergal O'Brien, and his last triumph came on a 9-1 shot for the Gloucestershire-based trainer. The rider stood up in the stirrups and saluted the crowd as he passed the post in front, before being congratulated by fellow riders and returning to emotional scenes in the winner's enclosure. \"It's been a rollercoaster, so many ups, so many downs, but I feel like I've got to the end of the ocean and walked onto the beach,\" he told Racing TV. \"It's been on my mind a few weeks, I've been asking opinions but I went for a coffee with my wife this morning and I felt certain. It's time for the next generation of jockeys.  \"It's a tough gig, it's constant. Being a jockey is 95% disappointment. I've had some enjoyment but I'm ready for the next chapter.\" Brennan won the 2015 King George VI Chase on Cue Card and was in contention for another Gold Cup with him later in the season before a late fall. When victorious on Imperial Commander for trainer Nigel Twiston-Davies, he had raised a finger to his lips after much of the pre-race talk had been about previous winners Denman and Kauto Star. \"Denman and Kauto Star is all I've heard for the last three months. It's been good for racing but it was never a two-horse race,\" said the Galway-born rider afterwards. Twist in the Gold Cup tale: Imperial Commander's triumph, external"

        "description": "Venue: ",
        "text": " Ronnie O'Sullivan says it will be his \"best season ever\" if he can claim a record eighth World Championship title in the modern era. O'Sullivan faces Jackson Page in the first round at the Crucible in a match that begins on Wednesday.  The 48-year-old is aiming to win his sixth title this term and become only the fourth player to win all three Triple Crown events in a season. \"I have just pitched up, played and got it right,\" O'Sullivan told BBC Sport. \"I haven't got this masterplan where I've plotted it out. If I did win it this year it would have to be my best season ever considering I have only played 11 events. They are the key events that I have won.\" World Snooker Championship 2024: BBC TV schedule, draw, seeds, format Alongside the UK Championship and the Masters, O'Sullivan has also enjoyed success in the Shanghai Masters, World Grand Prix and the Riyadh Season World Masters of Snooker during the current campaign.  Widely regarded as snooker's greatest ever player, the Englishman will also have the opportunity to win a record-extending 42nd career ranking title in Sheffield, while he has only once before, in 2000-01, won six events in a season.  However, while media talk has constantly revolved around moving ahead of Stephen Hendry - whose record he equalled in 2022 - O'Sullivan says he pays little attention to how many world titles he could end his career with. \"If I get the eighth, you'll be saying 'if you get the ninth it'll inspire this...' and it never ends,\" he added in an interview with BBC Radio 5 Live. \"When do you kind of go, 'what's enough?' I'll just keep playing and if I get to eight great, nine, 10, 11, 12, who knows.  \"Age is just a number. I've realised once I am round a snooker table I feel like a teenager and that's all that really counts and I'll just keep putting them [his opponents] in their place.\" McManus on O'Sullivan genius, Hendry & Higgins 'The Rocket' is currently enjoying an unbroken period of 745 days at the top of the world rankings - a remarkable feat considering he has limited his playing schedule in recent seasons. And he not only heads to snooker's most famous venue as the bookmakers' favourite, but is also regarded as the \"man to beat\" by many of his peers, a testimony to his longevity 23 years on from winning his first world title. Three-time winner Mark Williams says it is difficult to see past his fellow member of snooker's famed Class of '92 as the eventual champion, even if Judd Trump has more ranking event titles to his name this term. \"Even with how good Judd has been, if Ronnie plays in all the tournaments he is the best player by far,\" said Williams. \"There is no question that he is the best player by a mile. If he entered every tournament and played properly he would be number one player in the world easily.  \"Course he does [want eight], there is no question. He is the favourite. He does not have to play his top game. His B game [is good enough]... if he keeps himself together, he is the one everybody has to beat.\" Mark Allen, who has tasted success in both the Masters and UK Championship, added: \"Ronnie is coming off the back of an incredible season. \"Going for the eighth adds its own pressure but he has shown over the years he can handle it. He is chasing history and clearly the man to beat.\"  Aside from chasing history, O'Sullivan recently penned a three-year ambassadorial agreement with Saudi Arabia, committing the world number one to playing in all World Snooker Tour events in the nation. As part of that he says he is also committed to setting up an academy in the Middle East and developing an elite environment to widen the appeal and success of the sport. \"If you look at what China has done with their young players, you can copy and paste that and Saudi Arabia can develop academies where young players can go and play, create competitions and events,\" he added. \"I want to be part of it to make sure they get the right type of coaching. I've spent some time with a couple of young players trying to give them good basics and share things with them. I love seeing people develop. \"I used to be fascinated by the Nick Bollettieri tennis academy and think if I was a young kid that is where I would want to go, practicing among Grand Slam champions. That would inspire you. \"All I wanted to do was be close to Steve Davis as a kid because I thought if I could learn something from him it would help me develop as a player.  \"The excitement is creating an environment where young kids can develop as players and it is motivational that they can't help but become brilliant snooker players.  \"It's like Kenya and runners. If you want to be the best runner in the world, you have to go and live in their back yard because they know how to train and take it to another level. That is what I want to try and do.\"  Why is Saudi Arabia spending so much on sport? Sign up to My Sport to follow snooker news on the BBC app."

        "text": " Last year's Crucible winner Luca Brecel said he \"was looking forward to not being world champion again\" after he was defeated 10-9 by David Gilbert. The Belgian was 9-6 ahead and missed two glorious chances to win the match on a dramatic opening day in Sheffield. Brecel said he had been struggling with a throat infection since March, but did not use that as an excuse for losing. \"I wanted to go for a run but it wasn't possible and it has been a bit tough these few weeks,\" said Brecel, 29. \"Maybe if I was not defending champion I would've pulled out, but it's too big to pull out when you are seeded and defending world champion.  \"I was coughing all day but it's not an excuse: I was just not good enough. I missed some balls and he played well and kept fighting.\" Brecel beat former world champions Mark Williams, Ronnie O'Sullivan and Mark Selby to win his first world title in 2023. However, he said there were some down sides of being the world champion. \"It was a good year, but I look forward to not being a world champion again - I don't like all the attention,\" added Brecel. \"I've been waiting for the season to end for a few weeks. It's just a game, why should you be happy if you win and sad if you lose?\" Gilbert, 31st in the world rankings, reached the semi-finals in 2019 and plays either England's 16th seed Robert Milkins or China's Pang Junxu in the last 16 on Thursday. Brecel wasted match-winning opportunities in both the 16th and 18th frames and 42-year-old Gilbert admitted he had ridden his luck. \"At 8-5 down, it was the worst for me but Luca was struggling and he should've won at 9-6,\" said Gilbert. \"Then I found my rhythm and it was a really hard game. Huge respect for Luca, he is brilliant for snooker. \"It has been a while since I won a game in a proper arena and hopefully I can build on it. I don't want it to stop there. He said 'I hope you win it' and that means a lot coming from him. He has always been a lovely lad.\" Brecel's elimination means the so-called 'Crucible Curse', where no first-time champion has retained their title the following year, continues. \"Everyone was asking questions about it,\" said Brecel. \"I think I would've had a chance if I'd won this match but I wasn't capable of doing it.\""

        "text": " Judd Trump says anything other than winning the 2024 World Championship would be \"a failure\", but thinks Ronnie O'Sullivan is the tournament favourite. World number one O'Sullivan is looking to win the Crucible title for a record-breaking eighth time while Trump, ranked second, won the event in 2019.  Trump plays on Saturday's opening day, against Iran's Hossein Vafaei, while O'Sullivan has to wait until Wednesday. \"All the greats have managed to win the worlds multiple times,\" said Trump, 34. \"It's different to be playing on the first day, so nice to get involved in the tournament straight away. It has been a good season and I feel a lot more confident than last year.\" World Championship: BBC TV coverage, draw, seeds, format and prize money Snooker must 'embrace' new opportunities - Hearn 'Man to beat' O'Sullivan chases record eighth title Trump has won the English Open, Wuhan Open, Northern Ireland Open, German Masters and World Open in 2023-24, but lost 10-7 in the World Grand Prix final to O'Sullivan. O'Sullivan, 48, has also lifted the World Masters and Shanghai Masters trophies, as well as winning the other two of snooker's Triple Crown events - the Masters and the UK Championship. O'Sullivan has won both the Masters and UK Championship a record eight times and another Crucible success would move him clear of Stephen Hendry's seven world titles. \"With the season Ronnie's had he will still come in as favourite,\" Trump added.  \"He has a lot of pressure on him and it would be humungous to get the 8-8-8 [World, UK and Masters titles] in the same season. There's more expectation on him than in the past 10 years.\" Trump beat John Higgins 18-9 in the 2019 final, but lost to O'Sullivan 18-13 in the 2022 showpiece. However, they cannot meet in this year's final as Belgium's reigning champion Luca Brecel is the top seed, meaning Trump and O'Sullivan would play in the semi-finals if they got there. \"I would've loved to have played him in another final but in a semi-final he would be more vulnerable,\" said Trump, who will only be satisfied with lifting the trophy on 6 May. \"Unless I win it's a failure. If I go home from a tournament and not won, it's a failure. It's a horrible feeling, losing, and anything less than a win is not good enough. Even if I lost to Ronnie in the semi-finals it would feel a failure.\" Brecel, ranked fourth in the world, beat O'Sullivan in the 2023 quarter-finals on his way to a maiden world title, defeating four-time champion Mark Selby in the final. He begins his defence against 2019 semi-finalist David Gilbert, with the first session on Saturday from 10:00 BST, before they return for the evening session from 19:00 - meaning Brecel will either be the first man into the last 16 or the first eliminated. No first-time Crucible world champion has retained his title, and the 29-year-old believes he can break the so-called 'Crucible Curse'. \"It's my only chance to do it and I'm going to go for it and if it doesn't happen that's fine,\" he said. \"It will happen at some point, who knows I might do it. If I play at the same level I have a really good chance. \"It's tough to win the first time and then people get so much attention the next year they sort of crumble. That's not going to happen to me. If I lose, it will be because I didn't play well enough, not because I'm under too much pressure.\" Elsewhere, world number three Mark Allen has twice reached the Crucible semi-finals and feels there is more to come.  He said: \"I have won three tournaments and I'm up there in the one-year list and world rankings, but I don't feel I'm playing as well as I would like. I have a chance of winning even if I don't play well, which is a great place to be.\" Three-time world champion Mark Williams has beaten O'Sullivan, Allen and Trump in his past three matches and added: \"I'm not going as one of the favourites, but as one of the people they won't want to play. I have got a chance if I keep playing the way I am.\" Sign up to My Sport to follow snooker news on the BBC app. Ambition, money and deception: Discover the scandalous true story of Elizabeth Holmes and Theranos Can a quick HIIT workout boost brainpower?

        "text": " Alan McManus remembers Ronnie O'Sullivan's first coming at the Crucible, kind of. He knows it was 1993 and he knows that they met in round one. The buzz was all Ronnie. The score was 10-7 to McManus.  \"I didn't get a feeling of strength from him,\" says the three-time World Championship semi-finalist turned television analyst.  \"He was really wet behind the ears. His shot selection was poor, but his talent, you could see. He'd only been a pro a year, and six months later he wins the UK Championship. Demolished [Stephen] Hendry in the final. He turned into this monster over the summer of '93.\" The World Championship is back and O'Sullivan is favourite again. Seven titles and looking for an eighth, which would put him out on his own in the history of the game. McManus will call it from behind the microphone, most likely rooting for his big mate John Higgins while sitting in awe of O'Sullivan, who he regularly shares a commentary booth with.   \"Talking to Ronnie [about snooker] is like talking to [Pep] Guardiola or [Jurgen] Klopp and about football,\" he says. McManus set down his cue three years ago and does not miss the life of a player. Did it, loved it, hated it, loved it again. Commentary fulfils the 53-year-old from one end of the year to the next, but the Crucible is different. Ticketless, he tried to blag his way in there in 1990 but got turned away.   He played there the following year. Beat Willie Thorne, lost to Terry Griffiths - and cried. \"One thing I'm envious about is when they walk out. That's special. That never goes away,\" he says. Speaking on This Sporting Life, McManus talks about the carefree days of his youth when all he needed for a happy life was a cue in his hand and a back pocket big enough to house all the cash he was winning on the amateur circuit.  World Championship: All you need to know & BBC TV coverage O'Sullivan chases record eighth title - Crucible preview Why are there so few young Scots bursting through into the pro ranks now? Because the landscape has changed from his day, he says.  \"We don't have the amateur game we once did. The amateur game when I was a teenager was thriving - dozens of tournaments,\" he recalls. \"I played in a club under the Kingston Bridge. We'd go in there when it opened in the morning, play all day then go where the tournament was. Two and three in the morning, still playing. 'How we getting home?' 'Dunno'. That was your breeding ground.\" McManus was 17 and fearless. He saw an advert in a magazine about a three-man team event in Aldershot and off he and his mates went. Got a lift from a bloke with a minibus. They won the thing, of course. \u00c2\u00a31,500 in cash and another \u00c2\u00a3500 on top for the highest break. He felt like a millionaire.  \"We were playing at Charing Cross in Glasgow one night and we finished up about midnight,\" he says.  \"My mates were right good players, so we said, 'what we'll do now is we'll go to the Isle of Wight', because there was a tournament there.  \"'Big Rab' from Kirkcaldy drove through the night. We arrived at the ferry terminal in Southampton or Portsmouth or some place at seven or eight in the morning. 'Any ferries going to the Isle of Wight, guys?' we asked. It was a beautiful madness. If I could go back, I'd do it in two minutes.\"  As a pro, by his own reckoning, McManus was not the most talented, but as a competitor he was up there with the best. \"Every defeat was like a death in the family. I mourned for two days. I just wallowed in my own misery,\" he says. \"I wasn't flamboyant and I didn't try to be. I worked hard at my game. You can only be who you are. I never took a backward step. I wanted to rip a guy's guts out. Talent is nowhere near enough.  \"I've known players, literally hundreds of them, who were more gifted than I was, but if it got into a fight on the table, I backed myself all day. My drug was playing. That was my drug in life. I don't have it any more and that's fine. I had it long enough.\" He won finals, he lost finals. He lost a truckload of semi-finals and through the span of his career the same names keep popping up. He battled with Steve Davis and Jimmy White then Hendry and Higgins. Some of those contests were epic. He says he is privileged to know those guys.    And now, in his new life, he has views on them all.  \"I'm great friends with Stephen. He doesn't play many tournaments and he doesn't win any games,\" he says. \"He's not committed to playing, but the reason Stephen doesn't win games now is that he stubbornly refuses to play safe, he tries to be superman but he doesn't have his cape any more.  \"I'd love to sit him down and say, 'hey listen, do you want to win some games or are you just fudging around?'  \"He would win games because he's still a very, very good snooker player, but he plays like he's trying to prove that he's brave and you don't have to prove you're brave.\" He laughs when talking about Hendry and his peak years spent in a bubble. \"I almost never spoke to Stephen, for years. Not because he didn't like me or I didn't like him. He was there to play snooker.   \"This is a story and it's true. I've never said this to him and maybe I'll dig him up over it. We're playing in the World Cup in the spring of '96. Myself, Stephen and John [Higgins - and they won]. \"We're about two months away from it and we're in Bournemouth and I'm walking along this corridor and Stephen is walking the other way and he actually put his head down and ignored me.  \"We're the only two people there. I can't believe he's done that so I went to John, 'mate, you won't believe this'. And John's going, 'nah, you're imagining things'.  \"We're at the British Open about a month later and John comes to me and says, 'you'll not believe this, he's just blanked me as well'.\" He loves talking about his peers. Admires them massively, particularly Higgins.   \"John has an other-worldly thing about him. To be in the top 16 in the world for 30 years, which it's going to be in the next year or two, is unbelievable to me. It's unbelievable that he still has the hunger and desire.\"  When you ask who the guy is he admires the most, he says Higgins. For the player and for the person he is. He is supposed to be neutral at the Crucible but you get a sense that if Higgins was to do it again he would be bursting with pride up there in the box.  And Ronnie? A while back, McManus wondered if he was losing some of his magic. Said it on air. Bad idea. This season, O'Sullivan has won the UK Championship, the Shanghai Masters, the World Grand Prix, the Masters and the World Masters in Saudi. \"In Saudi, he got three tons and an 80-odd and did John 4-0. John didn't pot a ball in the match. Scored four points - a foul. I mean\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\" McManus did not have to say another word. It was written on his face. The life he had was special, the life he has now is still special. Different, but a joy to watch these players perform and nowhere better than at the Crucible, the playground for guys trying to rip each other's guts out.

        "text": " Mark Allen says that his career will have been \"a disappointment\" if he does not win the World Snooker Championship. The Northern Irishman has racked up 20 titles as a professional, including 11 ranking events, but has yet to collect the biggest prize in the sport. He begins his campaign for the 2024 title at the Crucible Theatre in Sheffield on Tuesday, 23 April. \"I've won the UK Championship and the Masters, two other majors, but you turn pro to win the Worlds,\" said Allen. \"I'll see it as disappointing if I don't win a world title. More than anything that's what I want to do. \"You dream as a young kid starting out to be world champion, having that final black to win a world title. That dream is still there and I believe I have got a good chance,\" the world number three told BBC Sport NI. BBC TV schedule, draw and seeds Allen has added a second Champion of Champions crown, a victory in the Shootout and a success in the Players Championship to his career CV, in a season which is now reaching a conclusion in Sheffield. \"I don't know that I've been playing my best snooker but I'm winning more matches and more tournaments than I've ever done,\" reflected the 38-year-old twice former world semi-finalist. \"Form comes and goes but as long as I can keep grinding out results when I'm not at my best, then whenever good form comes then winning becomes a bit easier. \"The Champion of Champions this year, that's one of the more comfortable tournament wins I've had and I played really well all that week, but I've still won two other tournaments when I didn't play all that well. \"I can mix it up now, I don't have to be at my best but it would be nice to go to Sheffield, play really well and win it comfortably, although it's never that easy. \"When I turned professional all I wanted to do was become world number one and world champion and that hasn't changed. \"100% I'll look at my career as a disappointment if I don't win a world title. I don't mean that to come across in any arrogant way but I turned professional to win a world title.\" Should Allen succeed in winning the ultimate prize he would follow in the footsteps of compatriots Alex Higgins (winner in 1972 and 1982) and Dennis Taylor (the 1985 champion). \"I wasn't born until 1986 so obviously those were a little before my time but I'm a proud Northern Irishman, I know the history of the sport and how much they did for the sport. \"Alex in particular, and Jimmy White, probably carried the sport for a number of years. It would be nice to add myself to that list but given what I've already done in the game I'm well in that conversation already [as the greatest Northern Irish snooker player ever]. I'll just keep doing my best and let others decide. \"To add a world title to that would be very, very special, and to bring that home to Northern Ireland.\" The World Championship will again be staged at one of the most iconic venues in UK sport, the Crucible Theatre, which has hosted the tournament since 1977. \"It [The Crucible] is very different to any other venue we play at. The crowd are so close, it's one of the smaller arenas that we play in, but the history attached to it just adds to the occasion,\" said Allen. \"You want to be part of history. People have asked me in the past would you move away from Sheffield? I would because I haven't won there but it would probably be different if you had won there, then you would never want to leave. It's a special, special place.\" ABBA's definitive story: How much do you really know about Sweden\u00e2\u0080\u0099s biggest musical export? Why was the video sharing platform, Vine, closed down?

        "text": " Eddie Hearn says snooker must \"embrace\" investment from different parts of the globe as the debate over whether the World Championship should leave its iconic Sheffield home continues. The Crucible Theatre has hosted snooker's flagship event since 1977. But with a capacity of just 980, calls to move the event have grown louder, with the venue's contract set to expire in 2027 on its 50-year anniversary.  \"The problem is the Crucible is very small,\" Hearn told BBC Radio 5 Live.  O'Sullivan 'the man to beat' as he closes in on 'best season' Hearn, whose Matchroom company own a majority stake in the World Snooker Tour, added: \"The tickets sell out instantly - you could sell it out four or five times, so it is difficult. \"We look at things that can continue to provide opportunities for our players, increase prize pools, grow and keep on evolving while also remembering the history of the sport, but that does not mean standing still.\" While the auditorium at the Crucible creates a unique atmosphere, the building's ageing facilities and its ability meet the demand for tickets has become a talking point within the game. Alexandra Palace in London - home to the Masters, one of snooker's other Triple Crown events - is able to accommodate over 2,000 fans, while the invitational Hong Kong Masters drew a record crowd of 9,000 when it was last held in 2022. \"Snooker does not need to just have to land in the UK or China. There are events consistently around the world and if there is going to be investment in different regions we need to embrace that,\" Hearn added. \"It is not on the radar in terms of trying to move the World Championship, but as the sport grows you have to understand that the flagship event will be in demand. We have three years left on the deal.  \"It is the most historic venue within the game and it is very important to the history and to the players. It would have to be an opportunity that would be difficult to refuse for the players. If there is an opportunity to drastically change the prize structure of the World Championship, for me you have to look at that.\"  Matchroom founder and president Barry Hearn has previously called on Sheffield City Council to build another Crucible venue in order to satisfy the pull of the World Championship. World Championship: BBC TV coverage, draw, seeds, format and prize money While opinion is split among players over moving from the famous venue, seven-time world champion Ronnie O'Sullivan is among those keen on a possible switch.  'The Rocket' has said he would like to see the tournament move, external to Saudi Arabia - which has signed him up on a three-year ambassadorial agreement - or China. In an interview with BBC Sport, Northern Ireland's Mark Allen agreed with the Englishman and outlined his belief that a move may benefit the game more overall. \"I love the history of the Crucible and everything that has happened there. I am a traditionalist in the sense that I love the long format and the proper test the World Championship brings, but things move on and change,\" Allen said. \"If we go somewhere else and it means more money and it is better for the long-term future of the sport, why not move?  \"If we are able to go to arenas that can hold triple what the Crucible can, why wouldn't we? I don't see a lot keeping us at the Crucible bar the history.\"   The 2005 world champion Shaun Murphy described snooker as being \"in the best state it has ever been in\" prior to his arrival in Sheffield 12 months ago.  But his comments, which came amid a match-fixing inquiry involving 10 Chinese players, raised eyebrows among the sport's other top players. \"A lot of players were probably a bit disgruntled with where the game was at,\" Allen added.  Wider concerns also focused on the game's finances and venues used to host prestigious tournaments, and during the present campaign there has been a high-profile row over player contracts and appearances in lucrative exhibitions in the Far East.  However, with events in China back on the calendar and new tournaments added and prize money heading towards record levels of around \u00c2\u00a317m, the former Masters and UK champion believes that the sport has moved on to another level. \"The authorities have taken on board a lot of what the players were talking about and the game has really gone to another level,\" he added. \"We believed that more could be being done and it took player criticism for that to happen. The problem the players had was 'where was all this 12 months ago?' The changes they have made are amazing.\" Sign up to My Sport to follow snooker news on the BBC app."

        "text": " Reigning world champion Luca Brecel suffered a shock deciding-frame loss to David Gilbert on a thrilling opening day of the 2024 event at the Crucible. The Belgian led 6-3 at the end of the first session and wasted chances to win in both the 16th and 18th frames. Gilbert, ranked 31st in the world, then produced a superb match-winning break of 65 to set up a match with either Robert Milkins or China's Pang Junxu. World number two Judd Trump leads 6-3 against Iran's Hossein Vafaei. Ali Carter holds a 5-4 lead over Stephen Maguire, Jak Jones is 5-2 up on Zhang Anda and Tom Ford has a 6-3 advantage against Ricky Walden. Saturday's World Championship action as it happened World Championship: BBC TV coverage, draw, seeds, format and prize money Who can stop 'favourite' O'Sullivan at the Crucible? Brecel had never won a World Championship match until an incredible run in 2023, including victories over former world champions Mark Williams, Ronnie O'Sullivan and Mark Selby, led to him clinching his maiden world title. No first-time Crucible winner has then gone on to retain their title the following year, and the 29-year-old was aiming to break the so-called 'Crucible Curse'. Century breaks of 134 and 104 helped him to a 5-2 lead and, despite an effort of 115 from Englishman Gilbert in frame eight, Brecel looked in complete control at the end of a high-quality first session. But the second session saw mistakes from both players, although that produced some thrilling frames with two black-ball finishes, one won for each player inside the opening three frames. Brecel got fortunate when going into the pack of reds in the 15th but that set up a fine break of 85, his best of the second session to lead 9-6, one away from victory. The Belgian will be wondering how he lost this match. He missed a red with the rest when 55-1 ahead in the 16th frame and then, when 51-6 ahead two frames later, failed to pot a green off its spot. There was still time for more drama as Gilbert missed match-ball in the last frame when holding a 69-0 advantage, but Brecel could not take the late opportunity as the 2019 semi-finalist advanced and last year's champion is eliminated.  Trump won the 2019 title and was in ruthless form as he punished any mistake from Vafaei, 19th in the world. The pair had met in 2022, with Trump winning 10-4, and the Englishman again holds the advantage before their match concludes in the Sunday afternoon session. Vafaei was 56-4, 67-0 and 44-8 ahead in the second, third and fifth frames respectively, only for Trump to win each frame, including one on the pink and one on the black. A superb clearance of 138 gave Vafaei the sixth frame, Trump took the next two, but Vafaei ended the session well with a break of 74. The match between England's Carter, a beaten Crucible finalist in 2008 and 2012, and Scotland's two-time semi-finalist Maguire was expected to be a tight encounter, and so it proved, with Carter leading 5-4 after the first session. Maguire made two centuries - 114 and 134 - as he won three of the first five frames, but Carter took the sixth frame on the black as Maguire's frustrations grew. A missed pot in the eighth frame saw him punch the table, but he composed himself to win the last frame and keep the match close going into Sunday's final session. Elsewhere, Wales' Jak Jones leads 5-2 against China's Zhang, although only seven of their nine scheduled frames could be completed in the opening session. Jones reached the quarter-finals last year, beating two-time runner-up Ali Carter and former champion Neil Robertson, and made breaks of 71, 68, 71 and 75 to take control against the 11th seed. They will resume at 10:00 BST on Sunday. The English tie between 10th seed Ford and world number 32 Walden saw Ford claim six of the opening eight frames, although a break of 142 in the final frame of the session brought Walden within three frames going into Sunday's conclusion. All the first-round matches are best of 19 frames, so the first to 10 advances.

        "text": " It's May 2022 and Ronnie O'Sullivan is sitting in his dressing room at The Crucible in Sheffield, on the verge of winning his seventh World Championship, a feat which will see him draw level with Stephen Hendry's record in the modern era and arguably cement his status as the greatest snooker player of all time. But he can't face going back out to play. \"I feel like I've got stage fright,\" O'Sullivan tells his psychiatrist, Dr Steve Peters. \"I feel like I want to cry. I don't even feel like I want to face it. I'm looking at my cue, I feel like my eyes are blurry.\" The 46-year-old took an early lead in the final, but his younger opponent, Judd Trump, has just won six frames in an afternoon session to battle back to 14-11. \"I'm scared mate,\" says O'Sullivan. This scene, from Sam Blair's new documentary, Ronnie O'Sullivan: The Edge of Everything - which streams on Amazon Prime from Thursday - illustrates some of the torture that snooker's most mercurial talent puts himself through for competition. Ronnie 'The Rocket' O'Sullivan has won almost every major record in the game during a long and distinguished career, but his struggles with depression, alcohol and drugs are well documented.   Blair's film is a character study in addiction to snooker perfection as much as anything. It's a dependency that doesn't always seem healthy and O'Sullivan knows the \"dark places\" that \"toxic competitiveness\" can take him. \"Emotionally, it's got me involved again and I hate this,\" he says after that poor session against Trump. Last week, on the eve of the documentary's release, O'Sullivan withdrew from the defence of his Champion of Champions title, citing the need to look after his mental health. Here are some takeaways from the film. O'Sullivan found snooker aged seven. In one scene, O'Sullivan recalls his father Ronnie O'Sullivan Snr sitting him down for a \"serious conversation\" aged \"nine or ten\", to tell him that he was going to be the best snooker player in the world.  O'Sullivan Snr would also force his young prot\u00c3\u00a9g\u00c3\u00a9 to go running for fitness, whilst he himself followed behind in a car. Although O'Sullivan calls the experience \"humiliating\", he says that he \"needed it\", otherwise \"I would have been a loser and he weren't having it\". When O'Sullivan was just 16 years old, his dad, who made his fortune running sex shops in Soho, was jailed for life for murder. For the young O'Sullivan, it was devastating.  \"Nothing can prepare you for that,\" he says. \"I couldn't make sense of it.\" In one scene, through tears, O'Sullivan remembers his father's words after being sentenced: \"Just tell my boy to win.\" Earlier this year, the seven-time world champion told BBC Radio 4 Today that he \"lost six, seven years to drinking and taking cannabis\". His close friend, famous British artist Damien Hirst, tells a horrifyingly illustrative story about how close O'Sullivan could quickly sail to the wind. \"I once had a time with Ronnie where he called me up and he just said, 'look, I'm in the Masters, I need to go the Priory',\" recounts Hirst. \"I said, 'I'll come in my car right now, I'll take you'. We sat down, had a cup of tea, he calmed down a little bit. He said, 'do you want to just have a little knock about on the practice table?' We did a little knockabout and then he went 'I think I might play this afternoon'.\" Hirst says that O'Sullivan went on to win that tournament. O'Sullivan talks constantly of having to manage his relationship with snooker. In one interview, laying on a sofa, he explains what the \"winning system\" takes for him. \"You've got to just smother yourself in the mustard and go deep within it - hurt and suffer,\" says O'Sullivan. \"Or I can take the approach that I did for the last five years and just enjoy every game. That was okay - there's less battle scars, less depression - you just enjoy playing it like you did when you were a kid. Sometimes you have to choose how bad you want it.\" As O'Sullivan was crowned world champion for the seventh time in 2022, he shared a prolonged hug with his opponent Trump that lasted over a minute. Blair's documentary picks up what was said between the pair through O'Sullivan's microphone. \"Enjoy your snooker, don't let them burn you out,\" O'Sullivan advises the 34-year-old Bristolian. Trump thanks the elder statesman, saying, \"you took your time out for me and I'll always appreciate that\". When the younger man tells his counterpart, \"you're the best player of all time, I love you man,\" it causes O'Sullivan to break down in tears. Next we see The Rocket embracing his children, telling them \"I can't do this anymore! It'll kill me!\" At 46, he is the oldest world champion in Crucible history. Posing for photos with the trophy, O'Sullivan's father turns to his son to say, \"that's it now isn't it? Done now aren't you?\" O'Sullivan's response is ambivalent: \"I don't know mate....\" Ronnie O'Sullivan: The Edge of Everything is available exclusively in cinemas across UK & Ireland on November 21 and launches on Prime Video on November 23.

        "text": " Iran's Hossein Vafaei has criticised the Crucible Theatre, saying the venue \"smells really bad\", the practice room is like a \"garage\" and the World Championship should move elsewhere. The Crucible, which only holds 980 people, has staged snooker's biggest competition every year since 1977. Its current deal expires in three years with many believing the event should then move from its Sheffield base. \"Should I be honest? Are you enjoying being here?\" asked the 29-year-old. \"History is very important but nobody invests any money in this historical venue. You want to go somewhere really nice. If you walk around the Crucible it smells really bad. I'm honest. Everything is so bad.\" Vafaei has played at the Crucible in each of the past three years and lost 10-5 to world number two Judd Trump in the first round of the 2024 competition on Sunday. But the Iranian would prefer the event to be held in either China or Saudi Arabia, a country that staged its first snooker tournament in March with the World Masters of Snooker. \"You go to other top venues in other countries and you can see how nice they treat you, how nice everything is and it is so shiny and completely different,\" added Vafaei. \"If you ask me do I want to come back here, the answer is no. \"The practice room? Do you see anything special about it? It feels like I'm practicing in a garage and that's not good. I'm coming here from a different country to see that. I'm sorry I have to tell the truth.\" Asked if the game would develop by going to China or Saudi Arabia, Vafaei replied: \"100%. Look at China and how they organise their tournaments, fantastic, how they treat the players with the red carpet, opening ceremony.  \"The players are feeling like stars but here nobody looks after the players, after the match, before the match here, no-one cares who you are. In China everything is different, Saudi Arabia everything is probably going to be different.\" The issue of where future World Championships should be held has been a key talking point at this year's competition and Vafaei was open to it staying in the United Kingdom, but only if the venue was improved. He said: \"If they don't want to lose the Crucible, invest some money - make it shinier, make it nicer, more luxury for the people, if they make it cleaner and nicer people would enjoy it. Why do you have to find a reason to move it?\" In response to Vafaei's comments, a statement from World Snooker Tour said: \"The Crucible is a historic venue and there are limitations given the size of the backstage areas. We work with the Crucible to make it as welcoming as possible for players.\" Four-time World Championship winner John Higgins thinks it is \"inevitable\" the competition will move away from its Crucible home. \"Thirty years coming here from the first time to walking in now, it's still the same buzz,\" said the Scot. \"The history, the special moments, the tears, the heartache, the joy, the Crucible has been a big part of my life and I will be sad when it goes.\" Higgins, the 1998, 2007, 2009 and 2011 winner, added: \"It's inevitable it will move. It has been an unbelievable place to play snooker and I've been lucky enough to win the event. It just feels the sport is bigger than one venue to hold the World Championship. \"People will be looking at the bottom line, whether it's Sheffield City Council giving more money or Saudi Arabia or China, it will come down to who offers the most.\" England's Shaun Murphy, who won the tournament as a 22-year-old in 2005, hoped they could find a way to keep it where it is. He said: \"I would love it to stay here. I remember walking up these stairs as a nine-year-old in 1992 coming to watch Peter Ebdon make his debut against Steve Davis and it has been so special ever since. \"As a player you know all those iconic snooker moments happened in that arena and it's a very special place for the players and fans that flock here ever year.\" But Murphy, who leads 6-3 against China's Lyu Haotian, admitted the game did have to adapt. \"It's our biggest event in possibly our smallest venue and those things don't go together well,\" added the 41-year-old. \"Will it move? I don't know, I hope not but I don't know.\""

        "text": " With the World Snooker Championship starting on Saturday, we have put together a beginner's guide to snooker. Here's what you need to know. The first shot (the break) involves a player hitting the white ball from the 'D' at the far 'baulk' end of the table into the group of 15 reds that form a triangle between pink and black. Unless a red is potted, the opposing player plays the next shot. A maximum break (a 147) is made up of 15 reds, 15 blacks, then each 'colour'. Although once rare, there have now been more than 200 maximum breaks achieved in professional competition, with six-time world champion Steve Davis making the first of these in 1982. Two red balls cannot be potted from consecutive shots by the same player, or a 'foul' penalty will be called. Players score one point for potting a red, after which they must nominate a colour for their next shot. The black is worth seven points and is the most valuable colour, followed by the pink (six), blue (five), brown (four), green (three) and yellow (two). A break of red-black-red-black-red-black would therefore be worth 24 points. When all reds are pocketed, players attempt to pocket the other balls in ascending numerical order. The object of the game is to use the white - the cue ball - to pot the other balls in the correct sequence. When the last ball is off the table, the game, or 'frame', ends, and the player with the highest score wins. A foul on the final black also automatically ends the frame, while a player may choose to concede a frame early if they consider themselves too far behind on the scoreboard. A frame is the term used for each individual game. During the World Championship, matches are decided by the best of 19 frames (round one), 25 frames (round two and quarter-finals), 33 frames (semi-finals) and 35 frames (final). In a match context, the term 'snooker' is used for when the cue ball is in such a position that a player does not have a clear sight of the ball they must aim for next. A player must then plot a path around the table for the cue ball as they attempt to get out of this 'snookered' position. The balls are arranged as follows: All reds in a triangle Black - on the spot near the top end of the table Pink - directly above the top of the triangle Blue - centre spot Green, brown, and yellow - on spots along the baulk line, on the left, centre and right spots in the D, the semi-circular marked-out area Snooker is played with 22 balls. The balls are listed below, with their points value in brackets. White ball (the cue ball - this ball is not to be potted, and to do so is a foul shot) 15 reds (worth one point each) one yellow (two points) one green (three) one brown (four) one blue (five) one pink (six) black (seven)  Snooker was invented in 1875 by an officer of the British Army in the Indian town then known as Jubbulpore. It has become an increasingly global game. Many players hail from the United Kingdom and Ireland, traditional hotbeds for snooker, but its popularity has soared in China over the past 25 years and the country has produced many leading professionals, while mainland Europe now has a world champion in Luca Brecel, the Belgian who won the 2023 title. Snooker balls are slightly smaller than balls used in pool. A set for the most popular variant of pool (often known as eight-ball pool) includes 16 balls: One white One black Seven coloured balls (spots) Seven striped colours (stripes) Every ball has a number from 1-15, the black taking the 8. Snooker cues - usually made of wood - are often slightly lighter than pool cues. Cues are available in different sizes, but professionals in both sports usually use cues of 56-59 inches in length. A full-size snooker table (12ft x 6ft) is larger than those used in pool. The tables used by professionals in American pool measure 9ft x 4.5ft. The aim of eight-ball pool is to pot all seven solid or seven striped balls followed by the black in order to win. There are several variants of pool, even at a professional level, but eight-ball is the most popular. A foul is called when a shot or action by the player is against the rules of the game. If a player commits a foul, their opponent is awarded four points, unless the foul occurred while playing the blue, pink or black - or the player hit one of those higher values first, or potted one by mistake, in which case the foul is worth the value of the ball in question. The referee may call a 'miss' if a player does not strike the correct ball and is judged not to have made a sufficiently adequate attempt to do so, with this usually occurring from a snookered position. The other player is awarded the foul and has the option to make the player play the shot again, usually from the original position. The Snooker World Championship runs at Sheffield's Crucible Theatre from 20 April-6 May and is available on the BBC iPlayer, Red Button, BBC Sport app & website."

        "text": " Former world champion Judd Trump moved into the last 16 of this year's event with a comprehensive 10-5 victory over Iran's Hossein Vafaei on Sunday. Trump led 6-3 after Saturday's first session and breaks of 95, 74 and 89 helped him move into the next round. He will play either Tom Ford or Ricky Walden, with Ford 6-3 in front. Four-time world champion Mark Selby is in danger of a shock first-round exit after Crucible debutant Joe O'Connor moved into a commanding 7-2 lead. O'Connor, 30th in the world, only needs three frames to reach the last 16 when the match resumes on Monday. Watch Sunday's play from the World Championship on the BBC World Championship: BBC TV coverage, draw, seeds, format and prize money It would be another huge shock after 2023 champion Luca Brecel lost to David Gilbert in a major upset on Saturday. But there was no threat of a defeat for world number two Trump, looking to win the title for a second time after his success in 2019. He has won five ranking tournaments this year and was up against world number 19 Vafaei, a player he beat 10-4 at this phase in 2022.  Trump appeared to be heading towards another 10-4 success, but missed the pink as Vafaei clawed one frame back, only for the Englishman to take the next to complete the win. Selby, the 2014, 2016, 2017 and 2021 champion, could be another seed to fall after a tough first session against fellow Leicester player and close friend O'Connor. That match will be completed on Monday (14:30 BST) with O'Connor, the only debutant in this year's tournament, looking to complete a huge victory. O'Connor was in the audience watching and cheering on Selby for three of his world title wins and described the draw as a \"dream\" one for him. The pair shared the first four frames, before breaks of 122, 67 and 101 took O'Connor three frames clear. Further breaks of 74 and 61 saw the 28-year-old win all of the last five frames in the session. Earlier this month, 40-year-old Selby hinted at retiring and said it's \"maybe time to do something else\" after losing 10-8 to Gary Wilson in the first round of the Tour Championship. Selby lost in last year's world final and has not been eliminated in the first round since 2018, but needs an excellent recovery on Monday. Welsh qualifier Jak Jones produced a superb performance to defeat China's 11th seed Zhang Anda 10-4. Jones, a quarter-finalist last year, is 44th in the world, had to fight through two qualifying rounds, but led 5-2 after the first session.  \"We both suffered from nerves, he missed a few balls and that can get on top of you but I'm happy to get through,\" said Jones. Jones is one of six Welsh players in the competition and could meet compatriot Mark Williams in the last 16, if the three-time world champion beats China's Si Jiahui. The first session of the Jones v Zhang match took place on Saturday morning, but only seven of the scheduled nine frames could be completed. One frame took 38 minutes, another 32 and another 28 - and it was again slow going on Sunday. Jones finally edged a 37-minute 11th frame after a lengthy safety battle to move two frames away from victory. Zhang made a break of 95, the best in the match, in the 13th frame, but it was not enough to stop Jones. \"In the first session I played terribly,\" said Zhang. \"This is the first time as a seeded player and I wanted to play well but I just put too much pressure on myself. Jak did not play bad, everything was just better than me.\" Another former winner, Shaun Murphy was 4-3 up against China's Lyu Haotian with two frames of the session to go. The evening session starts at 19:00 and sees the conclusion of two first-round matches. England's Ali Carter holds a 5-4 lead over Scotland's Stephen Maguire, while Ford is 6-3 up against Walden.

        "text": " World number one Ronnie O'Sullivan said he has gone through a period of feeling scared to play snooker as he reached the Tour Championship final. The seven-time world champion hit three century breaks as he beat Gary Wilson 10-7 on Friday in Manchester.  But he revealed he felt like he has been suffering from the \"yips\", and has tried to \"change his mindset\". \"I'm just trying really hard to not get down on myself,\" said the 48-year-old, who has won five events this season. O'Sullivan hit breaks of 102 and 110 to turn a 2-0 deficit into a 4-2 lead but fellow Englishman Wilson compiled runs of 83, 84, 82 and 96 to level at 7-7. However, he barely got a look-in from there as O'Sullivan won the final three frames, helped by visits of 98 and 129. O'Sullivan, who faces Mark Allen or Mark Williams in Sunday's final, told ITV4: \"It's not easy. Maybe two weeks ago I'd have mentally thrown the towel in, just because I wasn't flowing. \"But I just thought, 'just keep going, keep going' and just focus on some of the positives that might be round the corner.\" He says he has been speaking regularly with psychiatrist Steve Peters, adding: \"I've just got to commit to it now for a good year to try to get myself out of this sort of hole I've got myself in mentally with the obsession of the game, tinkering. \"I know I'm never going to stop tinkering, but I have to somehow get sort of my head strong enough to be able to deal with it and not go too deep into that horrible murky world that it is. \"Every sportsman - maybe golfers, tennis players, snooker players - I suppose we all do it, but I went so deep into that it's like detoxing myself from it. \"It kind of felt like I've had the yips in a way - mentally, physically - it feels like you get scared to even want to go and play. \"That's not a nice place to be, so I've got nothing left to do other than to try to get myself mentally out of it and hopefully my game will start to flow again, maybe.\" The Tour Championship is in its sixth edition after being launched in 2019 for the top players on snooker's one-year ranking list. This is the third time O'Sullivan has reached the final, having won the inaugural event by beating Neil Robertson before losing to the Australian in the event's showpiece two years later. Northern Ireland's Allen and Welshman Williams, both seeking their first Tour Championship title, contest the second semi-final on Saturday, starting their best-of-19 encounter at 13:00 BST.

        "text": " Jackson Page says he will have no fear facing the \"greatest of all time\" Ronnie O'Sullivan at the World Snooker Championship in Sheffield. The Welsh 22-year-old is the first-round opponent for O'Sullivan, who is seeking a record eighth world crown. World number 43 Page knows that upsetting Crucible hero O'Sullivan would make him an unpopular figure with some sections of the crowd. \"I don't mind... I'll give him my best shot to try and stop him,\" said Page. Page goes into the O'Sullivan match at the Crucible Theatre on Wednesday having beaten former champion Graeme Dott and Thailand's Noppon Saengkham in qualifying, and he is hoping to emulate his 5-2 win over Mark Selby during last month's World Open in China. World Championship: BBC TV coverage, draw, seeds, format and prize money Dale backs O'Sullivan over Crucible future \"If I bring the form I had in China like in the Selby match, I can easily do the same against Ronnie. He's not invincible, so if I play like that I'll win, if I don't it may be a different story,\" Page said. \"Everyone has the goal of going to win it. With Ronnie first, it doesn't make a difference to me, I've got to beat the table and who's in front me. I'll be looking forward to playing the greatest of all time on the greatest stage but I'll still want to win. \"I've played him once this season, it was a decent game. I had one chance in five frames. I think he had three centuries and I had one. Another time, I was younger, about 15, in the UK Championship, he beat me 6-3 so hopefully I'm due a win.\" Only once in 20 years has the 48-year-old O'Sullivan lost his opening match at the Crucible. But earlier in April, O'Sullivan lost the Tour Championship final to Page's friend and mentor Mark Williams, although Page says he will not be looking for advice from his fellow Welshman. \"There are no tips when it comes to that. You've just got to play your best against Ronnie, if you don't play well then you don't really win, if I play well I can,\" Page said. \"You've got to attack him and just play your best, you've just got to keep him off the table, so if I play well I can do it but we'll soon see.\" This is the second time Page has qualified for the Crucible. In 2022 he beat Barry Hawkins before losing to Williams in the second round. \"He battered me two years ago,\" added Page. \"Like Mark, I've always been calm and level-headed. I learn off Mark in many other ways, like on the table. \"Two years ago I qualified the hard way by winning four games and it was a good experience, especially winning a game. I'm just so relieved to be back there so quickly. \"It's completely different to any other event I've played in. The atmosphere is immense,  I think partly from watching it when you grow up and then to be there is something else. \"I've always wanted to be the best and have always wanted to win tournament.\" Page and Williams are joined in the tournament by four other Welsh players - Jak Jones, Ryan Day, Jamie Jones and Dominic Dale, who is playing at the Crucible for the first time since 2014.

        "text": " Ronnie O'Sullivan again questioned his snooker future after beating Zhou Yuelong 4-3 to reach the last eight at the World Grand Prix in Leicester. World number one O'Sullivan is attempting to win his 41st ranking event title this week.  He claimed a record-extending eighth Masters crown on Sunday but despite that success is far from happy with his current form.  \"The worst thing is you're winning tournaments,\" O'Sullivan told ITV4. \"If I was getting pumped every round playing like that, it would be an easy decision to make. \"I've got to really consider whether I can carry on feeling how I'm feeling out there - I just don't get any enjoyment from the way I'm hitting the ball. I feel like it's just hard work, I haven't a clue where the balls are going, and a lot of it's just guess-work.\" O'Sullivan made breaks of 67, 107, 50 and a match-winning 90 to defeat China's Zhou and will now face Gary Wilson in the best-of-nine quarter-finals after the Scottish Open winner saw off Tom Ford 4-2.  In November, a dispute with snooker's governing body left O'Sullivan threatening to quit the sport if he has to reduce the time he spends in China. But despite reducing his schedule this term, success in the UK Championship and Masters has given him the opportunity to win all three of snooker's Triple Crown events in the same season for the first time in his career. \"It's the only thing I've known and it's hard not to do this because it's my job, it's all I know, so I've struggled through it,\" O'Sullivan added. \"But I can't accept bad cueing, I'd rather cue well and lose than cue awful and win tournaments. I get no satisfaction out of it, I really don't. \"I'd give everything I've got to enjoy the game but I have not had that for a long time.\" Meanwhile, reigning champion Mark Allen lost 4-2 to China's Zhang Anda. Zhang opened with a run of 95 and took the first three frames before Allen responded with a superb 137 break. The Northern Irishman also took the fifth frame before Zhang sealed his win.

O'Sullivan, 48, is also aiming to become the fourth player to win all three Triple Crown events in a season. Defending champion Luca Brecel will play David Gilbert, while 2019 winner Judd Trump faces Hossein Vafaei. The tournament begins on Saturday at the Crucible Theatre in Sheffield, with live coverage across the BBC. World Snooker Championship 2024: BBC TV schedule, draw, seeds, format and prize money Four-time winner Mark Selby plays Joe O'Connor, who came though qualifying and is the only debutant in the draw. John Higgins - another four-time champion - will meet Jamie Jones, who defeated 2010 champion Neil Robertson in the final round of qualifying. Mark Williams, who won the most recent of his three titles in 2018, arrives at the Crucible having recently claimed the prestigious Tour Championship, but will face a tough opener against Si Jiahui, who reached the semi-finals 12 months ago. Mark Allen, who has won three tournaments this season, gets under way against Robbie Williams, 2005 winner Shaun Murphy plays Lyu Haotian, and there is also the prospect of an entertaining encounter between Ding Junhui and Jack Lisowski.  Gary Wilson will look to build on his successes in the Scottish and Welsh Opens when he plays another former champion in Stuart Bingham. Kyren Wilson will look to avoid an upset against 52-year-old Dominic Dale, who is appearing for the first time since 2014, having become the oldest qualifier since Steve Davis in 2010. Remarkably, O'Sullivan heads to Sheffield for the 32nd time while enjoying an unbroken spell at the top of the rankings lasting more than two years and is unsurprisingly the bookmakers' favourite to triumph. He has claimed five titles this season, including the UK Championship and the Masters, in the process earning \u00c2\u00a31.2m in prize money - more in a single campaign than any player in history. He has also defeated Page in both their previous meetings, although the Welshman is regarded as one of the sport's most exciting prospects and recently advanced to the semi-finals of the World Open. The 22-year-old will go into the contest after sealing a final-frame victory in qualifying over world number 22 Noppon Saengkham with a superb break of 107. Mark Allen, 2018 Masters & 2022 UK champion I've been here before and drawn the lowest-ranked qualifiers, but last time I lost. Robbie is a very good player - he scores heavily and gets on with it. I am looking forward to it. Ronnie against Jackson could be really interesting. Jackson does not seem to be scared of anyone. He will not be intimidated by the atmosphere, although Ronnie is trying to create a bit of history for himself. Ding versus Jack Lisowski is another huge match. Jack would have been the player that all the seeds wanted to avoid given how talented he is and how he performs on the big occasion. Hossein is not scared to ruffle a few feathers, so it will be interesting to see how he treats the build-up playing one of the form players of the year in Judd. Judd has won five tournaments this year and will be full of confidence.

Dragons seemed poised to break into the top four play-off places before back-to-back defeats stalled their momentum. McItnosh would welcome beating second-from-bottom Bath. \"If we win on Friday, we maintain where we are in the table, but if we lose we will slip down a bit and we don't want to be doing that,\" said McIntosh. \"One of our objectives for 2024 was not to be down near the bottom of the table, because the Dragons have often been down there before and we don't want to be this year.\" Dragons won three and drew one of their opening six Super League matches before the losses to London Pulse and Loughborough Lightning saw Dragons slip to sixth, with Leeds Rhinos and Surrey Storm only a point behind them. \"We happened to strike two really tough teams in Pulse and Loughborough two weeks' running and lost, so now it's about making sure we are still fighting it out for those middle spots,\" said McIntosh. \"It won't be easy as although Bath haven't had great results, they were slick when we played them in pre-season.  \"We will need a really solid, four-quarter performance.\" Netball Super League scores and fixtures Full BBC Netball Super League schedule The hugely experienced McIntosh has been credited for making a big impact at Dragons since her arrival in the Welsh capital 12 months ago. Dragons captain Nia Jones has pinpointed McIntosh as the key factor behind the team's early season upsurge from perennial strugglers to the fringes of play-off contention. McIntosh, 68, believes her rebuild of the squad, which followed substantial pre-season recruitment, is running to schedule. \"I was asked before the season started for a prediction,\" added McIntosh.  \"I knew we were a relatively new group that would take a little time to fit together, so I thought we were looking at finishing somewhere in the middle of the table and we are currently sixth. \"So, I would say we are about where I expected - in a group of four teams in the middle of the table who may chop and change a bit from week to week. \"What has really impressed me is how cohesive this group is. They really support each well across the court, and from the bench, and it's a real pleasure to coach them because they truly enjoy each other's company.\" McIntosh says that unified spirit was evident in the 69-41 defeat by Lightning last week, when Dragons' 22-year-old goal keeper Nansi Kuti made her Super League debut. \"She became Cardiff Dragons' number 119, but as an inexperienced player she was very nervous before she went on,\" McIntosh said. \"The scoreboard wasn't good for us, but the level of support and backing for her when she went on was terrific to see.\" Cardiff Dragons will feature in BBC Sport's televised games on Sunday, 5 May and six days later when they go to Severn Stars and Manchester Thunder respectively.

Women's netball at international level will now be restricted to players \"recorded as female at birth irrespective of gender identity\" or transgender athletes who can demonstrate to World Netball's satisfaction \"they have not experienced the biological effects of testosterone at any time\". \"Following detailed review of the science and consultation with experts and members, it has determined that international level women's netball is a gender affected activity and that a policy is required (to) ensure fairness and safety at this level of our sport,\" World Netball said in a statement. \"World Netball believes that the research on which it has relied is robust, it comprises many research studies, all of which have been published in peer-reviewed journals and come from multiple distinct research groups around the world.\" World Netball said national governing bodies could choose to \"modify or even not apply these guidelines\" if they decided to base their participation rules on other factors. In a statement, England Netball told BBC Sport: \"We want to ensure that netball is as safe, fair and inclusive as it can be. With World Netball having now published their updated gender guidance we continue to develop our own policy that seeks to support how best to include everyone in netball.\" It added: \"Our current guidance is under review and we will share further updates in due course.\" The international policy, which follows similar moves by other sports, will be reviewed annually by World Netball. In June 2022, swimming's world governing body Fina voted to stop transgender athletes from competing in women's elite events if they had gone through any part of the process of male puberty. The Rugby Football League and Rugby Football Union also banned transgender women from competing in female-only forms of their games. World Athletics banned transgender women from competing in the female category at international events, while world cycling's governing body the UCI ruled transgender women would be prevented from competing in female events. Transgender women have also been barred by the International Cricket Council from playing in international women's matches.

        "text": " It is the halfway point of the Netball Super League season and the newly renamed Cardiff Dragons franchise are already performing better than they have in the last 10 years. The club currently sit fifth in the table, but a win in their next two matches could see them rise to the fourth and final play-off position, if other results go their way. On Friday night Dragons host a Surrey Storm side a point and a place below them, and are again in action at Cardiff's House of Sport on 26 April against bottom side Strathclyde Sirens. It is a long way away from where they have been used to battling it out for the last few years, towards the bottom of the table. Captain Nia Jones believes that the change in results and performances is mainly down to the work being done off the court. \"Behind the scenes they are as well run as they have ever been,\" she said. \"I am lucky enough to have the perspective now having been at other top clubs in the league, Severn Stars and Leeds Rhinos.   \"I've seen how those guys run their franchises, and I actually don't think we give ourselves enough credit here in Wales at the Cardiff Dragons as to how well we try and do things behind the scenes, how well we look after our players.\" \"It's been backed up with incredible recruitment, both on and off the court with head coach Jill [McIntosh] and assistant coach Jen [Barrett], but also on the court they've kind of put their money where their mouths are.  \"They've said we don't want to keep being bottom of the table and they really have invested and that's coming into fruition.\" This is McIntosh's first full season at the helm after coming in for the final few games of last season. On the decision to take the role full time and what attracted her to it, McIntosh said she was not sure whether to take the job or not. \"It was a toss up. Do I, do I not? It was the challenge,\" McIntosh said. \"It's been quite some time since I'd done a full-on season with a head coaching role. Before that I was doing a lot of coach education, so that's where I was at in my career, bit of a challenge and I must say I'm enjoying it.\" McIntosh held the head coach role with the Australian Diamonds from 1995 to 2003, leading them to two gold medals at the Kuala Lumpur 1998 Commonwealth Games and the Manchester 2002 Commonwealth Games, plus two World Championships in 1995 and 1999.  McIntosh led several unbeaten campaigns with the Diamonds, racking up a 94% win ratio. Captain Jones is embracing working alongside such a decorated coach. \"I really enjoy it and obviously the athletes she's worked with during her career, it's a huge privilege that she asked me to undertake the role [of captain],\" Jones said. \"I still feel like I'm learning every day both as a player and as a captain under Jill, who also was the captain of the Diamonds as well. \"The key to it is open conversation, we talk almost every day, maybe too much for Jill's preference, but we update each other on how the group is, what Jill's plans are for the week. It's a collaborative approach and the girls respond really well to that.\" Dragons, who have recruited nine new players this season, know Friday night's game against Storm could define their season. \"Playing storm is really important,\" said McIntosh. \"We're right there with them. We need the win if we're going to stay in contact with that top four. It's really close in that middle sector of the ladder.\" According to Jones, a key battle will be between Dragons' former Surrey defender Leah Middleton and current Surrey attacker Peace Proskovia. \"We're actually full of confidence ahead of this Friday, they're coming off a loss,\" Jones said.  \"I think Leah Middleton was Storm's best player last season and we've poached her from them. So I think that will be a great battle in the circle for anyone coming down to watch.   \"That could be where the match is won and lost and I'm looking forward to it because we've got the home advantage.\""

During the regular season the BBC is broadcasting one match per round as part of a two-year deal with the NSL. Third-place Severn Stars' game against fourth-place London Pulse on 26 May has also been selected. Matches are available to watch live on BBC iPlayer and the BBC Sport website and app as well as on demand. Stars will also be shown live on the BBC on Sunday, 5 May when they host Cardiff Dragons before Manchester Thunder's match against the Welsh outfit is broadcast on Saturday, 11 May. Manchester Thunder are currently top of the Super League with Loughborough Lightning second on goal difference. Super League chief executive Claire Nelson said having domestic matches shown on the BBC was a \"game changer\" for the sport. \"It's so hard to grow women's sport, but how you realise your potential and ambition is by working with partners who just get it and say 'we believe in what you're doing and we want to help you on that journey', and the BBC reflects that for us,\" she said. \"Building those audiences across the UK is going to be really powerful for us, so we're delighted to be working with the BBC.\" Sky Sports has also announced its selections, external for rounds 10-13 after renewing its partnership with the sport for a further three years. The Netball Super League called the deal with both the BBC and Sky a \"landmark broadcast arrangement for the sport\". The 2024 Super League season is the last in its current format as the competition plans to relaunch and turn professional from 2025. Ten teams make up the 2024 division, with the top four progressing to the semi-finals in June. Philip Bernie, interim director of BBC Sport, said: \"Our live netball coverage has become increasingly popular with audiences, and now they can follow the excitement of weekly NSL matches free all season long. \"Following the success of the 2023 Netball World Cup final, which had an audience of 1.3m on the BBC, fans can now enjoy more live coverage as we keep delivering all the action of the game to a bigger audience.\" Matches had already been selected for broadcast up to round nine and the remaining five rounds will be confirmed in due course.

Pulse comfortably won all four quarters to secure back-to-back league wins. Goal keeper Funmi Fadoju was named player of the match for four deflections, four gains and two interceptions.  Pulse goal attack Berri Neil led with 25 goals and goal shooter Assaindey Olivia Tchine added 21. After the round-seven fixtures, Pulse remain in the hunt for a play-off spot in fourth place, while the Dragons are sixth.  Earlier, Thunder thrashed Bath 79-42 to overtake Loughborough Lightning at the top of the table on goal difference, with the teams equal on 18 points.  Bath were still in the game at 33-21 at half-time, but Thunder surged ahead with a dominant final quarter where they added 24 goals.  Thunder goal attack Lois Pearson starred with 31 goals, goal shooter Elmere van der Berg added 26 and Paige Reed 22.  It was a strong performance from Thunder to bounce back from the round six defeat to Lightning, who continued their impressive run with a 72-36 victory over Strathclyde Sirens on Friday.  Sirens stay bottom of the table in 10th and are winless this season.  Lightning's goalkeeper Alice Harvey was awarded the player of the match for the second game running. Lightning goal shooter Mary Cholhok scored 40 goals while goal attacks Ella Clark and Niamh McCall added 23 and nine respectively.  In Friday's other late match, Leeds Rhinos overcame Surrey Storm 64-60 in Sheffield.  The two sides were evenly matched throughout, with Rhinos winning the first and final quarters by just one point.  Goal shooter Joyce Mvula put 43 goals on the scoreboard and was aided by goal attack Harriet Jones' 21.  The victory for Rhinos, who are eighth, is only their second of the campaign and moves them to within three points of seventh-placed Storm.  In the early fixture, Severn Stars secured a narrow 58-56 victory at Saracens Mavericks in a thrilling round-seven match.  The round-seven win on Friday moves Severn into third spot and two points above fifth-placed Saracens in the league table.

        "description": "Venue: ",
        "text": " Cardiff Dragons captain Nia Jones praised the impact of Australian coach Jill McIntosh as they bid to climb into the top four of the Netball Super League. Wales captain Jones believes McIntosh has transformed the Dragons since her arrival 11 months ago. A measure of that progress could be apparent on Saturday when the Dragons host London Pulse in the Super League. \"I feel like a kid in a candy shop again,\" said Jones. \"I come away from every session with Jill having learned something new.\" Dragons - who are currently in sixth place - would replace London Pulse in fourth with victory over the English capital outfit. It would represent a significant high water mark for a franchise that has struggled down in the depths in recent seasons and finished bottom last year. McIntosh is a former head coach of Australia, who led the Diamonds to two world titles and back-to-back Commonwealth Games gold medals. \"Her sessions are super simple, but when you know that they won the Aussies World Cups and Commonwealth Games, you hang on every word she says,\" added Jones. \"She is so professional and well respected, but at the same time she is super-approachable and absolutely lovely. \"We are so lucky she is here. We are putting in good performances and getting results.\" Those results have so far been a marked improvement on last season, when McIntosh joined midway through the Super League campaign. After extensive recruitment - that included the return of Jones from Leeds Rhinos and the capture of South African international Khanyisa Chawane, plus experienced Australian Jacqui Newton - the Dragons have lost just two matches out of six so far this season. Their tally of three victories - one game was drawn - is already one more than they managed in the whole of last season. \"There has definitely been a change,\" added Jones. \"It was easy enough to just say that the Dragons needed more belief, but the quality of squad this year has made a world of difference. \"You can only go so far with the ingredients you have. We have strength in depth in so many positions now and that's a massive credit to the recruitment team. \"We have targeted certain matches and so far we have either got really close, or we have ticked them off already. \"We are playing a top-four team in Pulse and I genuinely think this group is full of confidence for that game - especially here at home in Cardiff. At home in Cardiff, we can beat anybody.\" Pulse are level on points with third-place Seven Stars, with both teams two points ahead of Saracens Mavericks and the Dragons, with four teams separated by just two points. For McIntosh, occupying one of the play-off places with only one third of the season gone would mean some work completed ahead of schedule. But the former Australia international - who has also coached in her homeland, as well as in New Zealand, Jamaica and Northern Ireland - has been impressed by how quickly her new recruits have combined with those who remained in the squad following nine departures at the end of last season. \"The whole squad is very cohesive,\" said McIntosh. \"They are a very united group who work well together, who get on well together, and whether or not they were here last year, they have gelled very nicely.\" Goal shooter Georgia Rowe was one of those retained from last season. She believes the return of her Wales team-mate Jones has proved to be just as significant as the hiring of McIntosh. \"The energy that Nia brings to every single session, every strength and conditioning session, and every game is huge,\" said Rowe. \"She is constantly messaging all of us and tracking how we are doing. \"I have had the pleasure of playing with Nia for many years now and when we have been apart at different franchises, I haven't felt as comfortable. \"I love having her in this team. The whole team would say exactly the same. She brings so much encouragement to all of us.\" After hosting last season's runners-up Pulse this weekend, the Dragons visit second-placed Loughborough Lightning on 5 April."

Thunder led by just four at half-time after a slow start but pulled away in the third quarter to record five wins from five so far this season. The four-time champions thwarted Storm's attack in the second half, limiting them to just 17 goals. \"Really happy with what they're doing, they all have each other's backs,\" said Thunder head coach Karen Greig. \"We've got to know what players are capable of, can they start or can they come on and impact.\"  Goal attack Lois Pearson impressed under the post, missing just one of her 33 attempts and combining seamlessly with wing attack Nat Metcalf. \"Lois just cruises through, she's immense. When she turns the burners on she appears from nowhere, her work-rate and vision in the circle, we're starting to see her take on that responsibility now,\" said Greig.

        "text": " Ineos Grenadiers owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe has called for \"real action\" to ensure safety in road cycling following a number of serious recent accidents. Ratcliffe, 71, has written a letter to cycling's world governing body, the UCI, outlining his concerns. \"Governing bodies have made very few changes and serious accidents are a common occurrence,\" Ratcliffe wrote. The UCI said the safety of riders remains their \"absolute priority\". Ratcliffe, who recently became Manchester United's biggest single shareholder, added in the letter: \"In Formula 1, when Ayrton Senna had his fatal crash 30 years ago in Italy, the governing body set out to transform the safety regulations of one of the world's most dangerous sports and significantly reduced injuries as a result. \"This contrasts starkly with cycling. As recently as last week, we had yet another horrific crash involving three of the world's top cyclists.\" The UCI acknowledged in a statement that \"too many accidents have occurred\" and \"concern for safety is shared by all road cycling's stakeholders\". The crash Ratcliffe referenced included reigning Tour de France champion Jonas Vingegaard of Visma-Lease a Bike. He required surgery after suffering broken ribs and collarbone in a crash on stage four of last week's Itzulia Basque Country stage race. Rivals Belgian Remco Evenepoel of Soudal-Quick Step and Slovenia's Primoz Roglic of Bora-Hansgrohe were also injured in the same crash, in which several riders slid off the road on a right-hand corner when descending, many striking sharp rocks and a drain gutter at high speed. The crash followed an accident for another of Visma-Lease a Bike's biggest talents. Belgian Wout van Aert also fractured his ribs and collarbone in the recent Dwars Door Vlaanderen one-day classic and will miss the Giro d'Italia in May. Vingegaard faces a race against time to defend his Tour de France title against Slovenian co-favourite Tadej Pogacar, who suffered a broken wrist in a crash last year. Ratcliffe added in the letter: \"Cyclists are always going to push things to the limit as they are elite sportsmen and that is why action is so important. We now need to see real action to ensure the safety of the sport.\" In June the UCI announced the formation of SafeR,, external a group to oversee all aspects of safety. The UCI said SafeR is \"still in its very early days\" but added the \"the benefits of its work\" should be seen \"as early as during the 2024 season\". \"We are working together to ensure accidents such as those recently witnessed are not repeated,\" the governing body added. Ineos have also seen their share of serious accidents in recent years, including the life-threatening injuries in 2019 to four-time Tour winner Chris Froome and a 2022 training accident that saw 2019 Tour winner Egan Bernal hurt at home in Colombia when he struck the back of a bus. Several professional cyclists have lost their life in competition or in training accidents in recent years. Last year 26-year-old Swiss Gino Mader of the Bahrain Victorious team died following a crash when descending at high speed on stage five of the Tour de Suisse."

The first, as a 21-year-old at Rio 2016, brought her gold in the women's team pursuit. The second, at the delayed Tokyo Games in 2021, was a very different experience. Again riding in the women's team pursuit, Barker helped the team reach the final, but was dropped for the gold medal race. The Great Britain quartet finished more than six seconds behind Germany to leave with silver. Barker still got a medal for her ride in the earlier round, but had to watch from the sidelines as her team-mates Laura Kenny, Katie Archibald, Josie Knight and Neah Evans received theirs on the podium. With no bad feelings towards her team, she later posed happily with her own medal round her neck.  But behind her smile was a secret. In her pocket was a positive pregnancy test. \"Unfortunately I wasn't put in the final, which sucks, but it has to happen to somebody,\" she said. \"I was handed my medal afterwards alone, which was a very underwhelming experience. \"But I was also very lucky that two or three hours later I took a pregnancy test and found I was pregnant with my first child.  \"So I didn't really have a huge amount of time to sit and reflect on getting my medal in that way. I actually just had a huge amount of planning to do and it was all about looking to the future.\" Paris 2024: GB teams release kits for Games That future was uncertain. More and more female athletes are having children and returning to the top of their sports, but Barker still admits she did not know how people would respond. In reality she was shown a lot of support - not least from her team, Uno-X Mobility - who last year gave her a four-year contract to 2027. After Nico was born in March 2022, Barker's first training sessions would be on the turbo trainer - rocking Nico's cradle alongside her as she rode. For her strength and conditioning, she would use him as a weight. Within months, she was competing again and represented Wales at the 2022 Commonwealth Games that summer. But it was last year when Barker really announced her return to the top. She won two gold medals at the World Championships in Glasgow, taking her overall tally of world titles to seven. Perhaps even more sweetly, one was in the women's team pursuit alongside her younger sister Meg. \"It's been a hugely challenging couple of years,\" she admitted, \"which I think is the case for anyone who's a parent. There's not really an easy way to do it. \"But I do feel really, really proud of the World Championships last year. When I was pregnant I didn't think I would make them. I thought it would be too soon. \"So to go and win two gold medals was amazing.\" It has fuelled the fire for more success in Paris this summer, although Barker says that desire never went away. The advantage of having Nico alongside her is the perspective it brings her. \"When it's hard, it feels impossible, but when it's good, it's amazing,\" she said. \"You get the best of both worlds. I get to fit my exercise and social life into one neat four-hour block, which not many parents get to do. Then I get to come home and spend the rest of the day with my little boy. He's changing so much - it's such a special time. \"He provides that distraction. He reminds me that actually everything that's really important is right there at home with me.\" Nico may not know where they are going when they get in the car, but his mother hopes the destination will be Paris come July."

        "description": "It had been that long they had worked out the exact number of days - 4,095.",
        "text": " It had been that long they had worked out the exact number of days - 4,095. Not since late 2012, more than 11 years earlier, had a British women's team sprint squad won a gold medal.  But at the Adelaide leg of the Track Nations Cup in February, Katy Marchant, Emma Finucane and Sophie Capewell finally bucked that trend. Such had been Great Britain's lack of success, they did not even qualify for the team sprint at the Rio or Tokyo Olympics, while individual medals started to dry up after 2016. By 2019, the squad had had enough and made a pact - they wanted to \"change the narrative\"., external \"We realised we weren't going to qualify for Tokyo in the team sprint. We decided we didn't want this to happen again,\" says Capewell. \"We didn't want to be the squad that was having to find different avenues to qualify for an Olympics. We wanted to be a force.\" That is what they are now. Five years on, GB's women are enjoying success across all the sprinting disciplines, and with the Paris Olympics just around the corner, their story tells a different tale. Sprinting success was not sparse in the heady days of London 2012. Victoria Pendleton won two medals, including keirin gold, and it would have been three had she and Jess Varnish not been disqualified from the team sprint final. The following year, Becky James won two golds and two bronzes at the World Championships, and would also go on to win world bronze in the keirin and team sprint with Varnish in 2014, and the same colour in the keirin in 2016.  At the Rio Olympics, James won double silver while Marchant won individual sprint bronze.  Then came the drought.  From 2017 to 2020, Britain's female sprinters won no medals at World Championship level, and only one - a team sprint silver in 2020 - at the Europeans. At the postponed Tokyo Olympics in 2021, having not qualified in the team sprint for the second successive Games, Marchant was the sole female sprinter in the Team GB squad and came home empty-handed. With British Cycling's sustained success across all disciplines continuing around them, Finucane said the squad felt they were classed as the \"weakest link\". \"We felt like the tag-along squad at one point. Our seat at the table didn't feel as powerful as everyone else's,\" adds 25-year-old Capewell. \"We wanted to be on that table of success.\" \"You want to be the talk of the town, and I've been the talk of the town for the wrong reasons when you're not getting the medals,\" says Marchant, 31. \"It's really nice now to be a part of something that is getting the results and is getting recognised, and now all of a sudden everyone's talking about the women's sprint.\" Marchant says it was in the lead-up to Tokyo that she noticed a shift, with work being done by British Cycling at the foundation level to build the numbers of female sprinters coming through the system to feed into an elite squad that was thin on the ground. Though everyone points to small changes collectively having an impact, the arrival of a new head coach - Australia's four-time world champion Kaarle McCulloch - had a monumental effect. \"That came with a lot of belief put on to us,\" says Capewell. \"People coming in and saying 'we think you can do this and we're backing you'. It's not that that's not been there in the past, but it's more prevalent now.\" Finucane, 21, adds: \"She had a lot of confidence in us. She was really driven by us and I think that gave us a lot of confidence. \"We had a voice, people heard us and people saw us and then that came on to the track and people were like 'oh these girls can do it'.\" After becoming a mother in 2022, Marchant returned to find strength in depth in \"a group of eight or nine girls who were performing at a really high level\". \"I was doing everything I could leading into Tokyo but I never had anyone chewing at my heels or anyone pushing me to go faster,\" she says. McCulloch left the GB programme 14 months after joining, but her impact continues to be felt. With former men's coach Scott Pollock now at the helm, Capewell says \"that momentum hasn't gone anywhere\". The focus, under both McCulloch and Pollock, has been on 'happy head, happy legs', a focus on the riders as people first and athletes second. Away from the track, Capewell is a keen photographer, while Marchant has her own baking business. In 2023, Pendleton - a double Olympic and nine-time world champion across the sprint disciplines - was brought in to spend three days with the squad, sharing her knowledge and experience. \"We've been very proactive about how we wanted that programme to run,\" says British Cycling's performance director Stephen Park. \"We recognised that some of the ways that it had run in the past were perhaps not the best. So we wanted to learn lessons from that.  \"Kaarle was given support to develop those riders into young, positive, confident women that felt that they did have the right to a seat at the table.  \"And that meant that they did lots of things away from the track trying to develop them and develop their confidence, as well as lots of stuff on the track. \"Our physiology team and nutrition team have been really conscious around trying to be very specific about programmes for women rather than slightly altered programmes for men, which historically they probably were.\" Since Tokyo, the squad's results have slowly turned for the better. Successive world bronzes in the team sprint came in 2021 and 2022, but 2023 was the year they really caught the eye. At the World Championships in Glasgow, Finucane won sprint gold while she, Capewell and Lauren Bell won silver in the team sprint. In Apeldoorn in January, Marchant - who is racing quicker then ever before - became the first British woman to be crowned European champion in the 500m time trial, meaning Great Britain currently boasts the European champions in the event in the elite, under-23 (Rhianna Parris-Smith) and junior (Georgette Rand) categories. Looking ahead to Paris, Olympic qualification will be confirmed in April but Finucane currently tops the UCI rankings for the individual sprint, while Great Britain lead the team sprint rankings. For the first time in 12 years, Team GB heads to an Olympics among the favourites for the women's team sprint gold, with exciting medal chances across all the sprinting events. \"I think it's such a privilege that we are in this place and we just want to keep the momentum moving towards Paris,\" said Finucane. \"I am really confident they're going to do well,\" says Park. \"It's actually a joy to be part of their journey, because it's great to see them enjoying their riding, feeling that they're in control of their programme, and they're writing themselves into the history books.  \"Other people are trying to help create and support what they want, but ultimately those women are doing it for themselves.\" A sister's quest for the truth: Thrilling five-part murder mystery by Mark Healy Is it the end of an era for Royal Mail?

        "text": " There's a comeback in road cycling this year which could be momentous - a huge achievement in a sport so demanding on the body.  And, no, it's not Mark Cavendish\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Britain's former world champion Lizzie Deignan starts the 2024 season looking to regain the race-winning form which made her one of the best in the world, 18 months after having her second child. At the age of 35, Deignan is in the final year of her contract with the Lid-Trek team, knowing she needs to come closer to the form she showed after having her first child.  She won several of the sport's biggest races across 2019-2021, including the inaugural one-day Paris-Roubaix Femmes in spectacular fashion in awful conditions. Deignan said: \"2023 was my first season without a victory. I haven't been shy about stating that, this year, I want to reverse that trend. I know I can.\" Lidl-Trek have been very supportive of their riders, especially when it comes to family planning. Last year helped consolidate Deignan's fitness, and saw her play more of a supporting role. But this year should be different.  Her season kicked off during last week's 'opening weekend' in Belgium at Omloop het Nieuwsblad.  But it's at another tricky one-day race - the chalk-dust roads of Strade Bianche in Tuscany, Italy, on Saturday - where she could hit her stride. \"I've put the work in and I am pretty optimistic about being able to win again,\" Deignan added.  \"I am not going to say that it will definitely happen this weekend - it can take time to find your race rhythm.\" And there's more and more Britons coming to the fore in the Women's World Tour, although the only other British rider to have won a World Tour race since it was launched in 2019 apart from Deignan is Team DSM-Firmenich Post NL's Pfeiffer Georgi, who took victory in the Brugge-De Panne one day race in 2023. Georgi, 23, is a powerful one-day racer who also captains her team in the peloton and protects other riders when not racing for herself, such as sprinters on flatter stages.  Many of the best British female talents in the peloton focus on one-day events and time trials; climbing still being a relatively new and uncommon type of racing on the women's side of the sport.  \"I love the one-day classics,\" says Wales' Elynor Backstedt, another one-day racer and time trialist with potential to win big.  \"I love flat, hard, windy races. I don't go so well in mountains. Cold, wet races are more my kind of thing.\" Backstedt, 22, along with her sister and \"favourite rider in the peloton\" Zoe, the 19-year-old multiple world junior champion, come from strong cycling stock - their mum and dad both raced, with dad Magnus winning the men's Paris-Roubaix in 2004. The elder Backstedt sister, who rides for Deignan's Lidl-Trek team, added: \"I've had a few rough years in terms of injuries. [Trying to compete for wins] is something I'm looking to do more of. I feel like I am good at reading the race well enough to be in that position.\" And the list of potential British achievers goes even deeper, including 22-year-old Anna Shackley, who came second at the inaugural Tour de l'Avenir Femmes in 2023 and who rides for the dominant SD Worx team, and Anna Henderson, fourth in last year's world time trial championship, at Visma-Lease A Bike. The big-money Hess team join five other British teams in the continental second tier and have already signed some young Britons, such as Holly Ramsey and Grace Lister, for this season as they look to move to the World Tour from as early as next year - more evidence of the growth of a sport, seemingly by the week. Cycling's world governing body the UCI says women's salaries and team budgets are increasing year-on-year, while the number of applications for teams exceeded the available number of licences for the first time last year. \"It's a really exciting time,\" adds Backstedt, in what is now her fifth season.  \"Races have got longer with their intensity and there's more of them. And teams are getting bigger to accommodate that.  \"Coming from a family where my mum [former British champion Megan] had to have a job whilst being a cyclist, it's great.\" But for these young British riders to become winners in the peloton, they have to do something about the domination of the low countries.  That domination is thanks mainly to Belgium's Lotte Kopecky, and the Netherlands' Marianne Vos and Demi Vollering, who was last year's winner of the Tour de France Femmes. Vollering had a phenomenal season in 2023, even beating the now-retired superb climber Annemiek van Vleuten on the Col du Tourmalet. Expect those three names to be at the forefront of all big races in 2024, including at the Paris Olympics and World Road Championships in Zurich, which are live on the BBC in September.  The best of British, however, will not be far behind."

Van Aert, 29, broke his collarbone and several ribs at the Dwars door Vlaanderen one-day race in Belgium.  He had been set to make his Giro debut, but could return in time for this summer's Paris Olympics. In a video message, Van Aert said his \"ribs are still a limiting factor\" and \"at this point I cannot train at all\". Van Aert had to withdraw from the recent Tour of Flanders and Paris-Roubaix classics, and will also miss the Amstel Gold Race, taking place from 14 April.  The Visma-Lease A Bike rider said a \"lot of injuries are quite good\" but conceded it was \"a big shame\" not to be taking part in the Giro, which starts 4 May.  \"I'm really disappointed to miss my second big goal of the season but at this moment I need to prioritise my health and I need to give my body the time to recover,\" he said.  Van Aert, a nine-time Tour de France stage winner, is one of the favourites for the gold medal in the individual time trial and the 273km road race at the Olympics. France's Christophe Laporte will replace Van Aert in Visma's Giro team."

The Lidl-Trek rider crashed heavily during the Women's Tour of Flanders race in March. \"I've been told to push through certain levels of pain, particularly because of the injury I've had,\" Deignan said.  The 35-year-old returned to cycling last year following a sabbatical in 2022 after the birth of her second child. She added: \"To get full mobility back, I have to push myself to straighten my arm more than I want to. I am struggling to know what is a good level of pain.  \"So I'm figuring out my limits in terms of pain of a broken bone. I've not done that before.\" 'I know I can win again' - the return of Deignan Deignan is aiming to return to the form which led to her winning some of the sport's biggest races after giving birth to daughter Orla in 2018 - including La Course by Tour de France and the inaugural Paris Roubaix Femmes in 2021. She is in the final year of her contract at Trek, who have started the season strongly with big victories for Deignan's Italian team-mates Elisa Longo Borghini and Elisa Balsamo. But Deignan herself will want to win races again after having her second child Shea - something which will be seen as a huge achievement in a sport so physically demanding. \"I've come back from two pregnancies, so I know the process of getting fit again. It's about being patient.  \"I've never broken a bone in my life before, so I didn't know what to expect. Luckily, my husband [ex-Team Sky rider Philip Deignan] has broken several. So he has been guiding me through it,\" she added.  And Deignan expects to be ready for the Women's Tour of Britain, which returns in June following a hiatus last year because of funding issues and is now organised by British Cycling. Former winner Deignan not only sees the race as special to her, but also as a crucial time to prove her fitness for this summer's Paris Olympics.   \"I'm already on the turbo doing the hard yards in the garage - the limiting factors are holding brake levers, gearing. I don't have strength in my hand yet.  \"The main problem is [now it is] Olympics selection time, I missed a good chunk of races I was peaking for in terms of getting selected - there's actually plenty of time for competing [in Paris].  \"But selection is harder than it's ever been.

The Israel-Premier Tech rider, 27, is the first British male winner of the 88-year-old spring classic. But fellow Briton Tom Pidcock was among several riders to abandon the race amid torrential conditions in Ardennes. \"I'm so happy. I've watched this race so many times on television and dreamed of coming with good legs to try to win it. I'm on cloud nine,\" Williams said. \"I saw the '300m to go' line and I thought if I could put five seconds into the group and get near the line, then I could hold on.\" Williams came into the race on the back of victory in the Tour Down Under and a series of strong displays at the Volta a Catalunya but few predicted this surprise win.

Pidcock stormed to the front during a sprint finish and held off Marc Hirschi, with Tiesj Benoot in third. Victory in the Netherlands was the first on the road this season for the Ineos Grenadiers rider, 24. Marianne Vos snatched victory in the women's race when Lorena Wiebes thought she had won and celebrated too soon. In the men's event, Pidcock, Hirschi and Benoot were part of a quartet that escaped from a late breakaway on the twisty, hilly 253.6-km run from Maastricht to Valkenburg. Mathieu van der Poel, the Dutch rider who has dominated the last two Sundays with wins at the Tour of Flanders and Paris-Roubaix monuments, was content to wait in the pack. Van Aert to miss Giro d'Italia through injury Vingegaard suffered lung injuries in Itzulia Basque Country crash The breakaway reached the line just ahead of the chasing pack, with Mauri Vansevenant hitting the front before Pidcock stormed past the Belgian and held off Swiss rider Hirschi of UAE Team Emirates. Pidcock was second behind Wout van Aert in 2021 and third last year as Hirschi's team-mate Tadej Pogacar won the Gold Race for the first time. Slovenia's two-time Tour de France winner, 25, is skipping the spring classics to focus on preparing for a Giro d'Italia-Tour de France double. Earlier, the women's race was held up for an hour and shortened, after an accident involving a police motorbike escorting the peloton. During a sprint finish in Berg en Terblijt, Wiebes raised her arms a few metres short of the line to celebrate, which allowed Vos to lunge forward to snatch victory from her Dutch compatriot. This is the 36-year-old's second victory in the women's race, which returned in 2017 having previously been staged from 2001-2003, while Wiebes, 25, has yet to win it. A policeman \"was injured following a collision with a car on the Bergseweg while supervising the Amstel Gold Race\", the Limburg police said on X. The race was held over a shortened route that avoided the crash site, with Vos - who rides for Visma-Lease a Bike - exploiting the error by SD Worx's Wiebes to win the sprint, while Britain's Pfeiffer Georgi was fourth behind third-placed Norwegian Ingvild Gaskjenn. 1.Tom Pidcock (GB/Ineos Grenadiers) 5hrs 58mins 17secs 2.

Wales will host the first two stages of the 2024 race, which starts on 6 June. The first edition under its new name - it was previously known solely as the Women's Tour - will begin in Welshpool, with stage one ending in Llandudno. \"I'm really grateful to the people who have made it happen against he odds,\" said Lidl-Trek's former winner Deignan. \"Hard work has gone on behind the scenes to pull this event off. Sometimes it's underestimated how much it takes to put on a race,\" the 35-year-old added.   The Women's Tour was cancelled in 2023 after organisers failed to find the funding required for the race. The world's top female riders and teams will race through Wrexham on day two as the rebranded event returns this year. The tour will then move on to Warrington before concluding in Greater Manchester on Sunday, 9 June. Deignan added: \"People in the UK are brilliant sports fans and there's this sense of excitement and thrill at being able to be part of a spectacle like a bike race - and it's exciting to be able watch at the side of road and to be in centre of that is not something I take for granted.\"  Jon Dutton, chief executive of British Cycling, said: \"While there is still a great deal of work to do, today is another important milestone in our journey and reflective of the enormous goodwill and support which major road cycling events continue to enjoy.  \"Our primary focus has been to deliver a safe and competitive race in 2024, but we remain every bit as determined to harness the race's spotlight to make a real impact in the communities which it touches, and know that is a vision which resonates strongly in conversations with prospective commercial partners and hosts.\"           The four stages include varying terrain, with the first stage beginning in mid-Wales before riders head to Llandudno on the north coast. Starting and ending in Wrexham on day two, riders will take on the challenging climbs in the Clwydian Range and Dee Valley.  They will then cross the border to begin and end stage three in Warrington, a flatter route which will favour the sprinters.  British Cycling take on organising Tour of Britain races for men and women The fourth and final day sees riders depart from National Cycling Centre, the home of British Cycling, before finishing the tour in Leigh.                                                    Rod Ellingworth, Tour of Britain race director, said: \"It's been a monumental effort by the whole team over the past 10 weeks to confirm the stages for this year's Tour of Britain Women.  \"The race will take in four competitive and challenging routes, some challenging climbing in Wales and what I'm sure will be brilliant crowds on the roadside throughout.\"  Stage 1 - Thursday 6 June 2024: Welshpool to Llandudno  Stage 2 - Friday 7 June 2024: Wrexham Stage 3 - Saturday 8 June 2024: Warrington Stage 4 - Sunday 9 June 2024: Greater Manchester                                                       "

        "text": " Dame Laura Kenny, Britain's most successful female Olympian, has announced her retirement from cycling. The 31-year-old won five Olympic golds and seven World Championship titles in a distinguished career on the track.  She gave birth to her second child in July and had previously been targeting a fourth Olympics in Paris this year.  \"I always knew deep down I would know when the right time was,\" said Kenny in an exclusive interview with BBC Breakfast.  \"I have had an absolute blast but now is the time for me to hang that bike up.\" Join the BBC Sport WhatsApp channels Kenny, who is married to former cyclist Sir Jason Kenny - the most decorated British Olympian, added: \"It's been in my head a little while, the sacrifices of leaving the children and your family at home are really quite big and it really is a big decision to make. \"More and more, I was struggling to do that. More people asking me what races was I doing, what training camps was I going on - I didn't want to go ultimately and that's what it came down to. \"I knew the minute I was getting those feelings. Once I said to Jase, 'I don't think I want to ride a bike any more', I started to feel relief.\" Kenny gave birth to her first son, Albie, in 2017 after which she returned to cycling, eager to prove athletes could juggle the demands of sport with motherhood.  After a miscarriage in late 2021 and an ectopic pregnancy just months later, the Kennys welcomed their second son, Monty, in 2023. Earlier in March, British Cycling performance director Stephen Park said Kenny had only a \"slim chance\" of competing in Paris. \"I was getting these hesitant feelings,\" said Kenny. \"Going on to win another gold medal, as much as I would love to do that, it wasn't giving me the energy I wanted any more, it just wasn't.  \"I wasn't thinking, 'I really want to go on and win one'. I was thinking, 'I really want to stay at home with the children'.\" Kenny said the logistics of being on the road with Albie during her bid to compete in the 2020 Olympic Games in Tokyo - delayed to 2021 because of the Covid-19 pandemic - were very stressful.  \"Taking Albie around the world, travelling around the world with him and qualifying for the Tokyo Olympics was absolute carnage,\" she told Woman's Hour on BBC Radio 4.  \"I think Jason and I had this way of painting this really beautiful, easy picture and the picture that everyone wants: you can have a baby, you can come back and you can go on to win a gold medal - and it looks easy, and I'm telling you, it was far from easy, it was absolute carnage. \"And there were so many sacrifices along the way; there were so many flights I had to book here, there and everywhere. It was expensive.  \"It worked, yes. But it didn't come without some serious heartbreak and sacrifices.\" Already a three-time world champion by that point, Kenny burst into public consciousness by winning gold in the women's omnium and team pursuit at the London 2012 Olympics. Kenny said that was the \"absolute highlight\" of her career, with the 2012 Games a life-changing two weeks during which her relationship with Jason also became public. \"I never thought I would go to a home Games, let alone go on to win two gold medals. \"When I look back, I'm like 'wow, those two weeks did really change my life'.\" She repeated the omnium and team pursuit double four years later at the Rio Games, becoming the first British woman to win four Olympic titles. At the Tokyo Olympics, Kenny won team pursuit silver, before she and Katie Archibald became the first Olympic champions in the women's madison, a new event at that year's Games. It made Kenny the first British woman to win a gold medal at three consecutive Olympics and the most successful female cyclist in Games history. A fourth Olympics in 2024 was her plan but Kenny had yet to return to team training before announcing her retirement. April's Track Nations Cup in Canada would have been her last opportunity to earn the points needed to qualify. She won her last world champion rainbow jersey in 2016, on the London track where she made her name, in the omnium and scratch race. Kenny is also a 14-time European champion and won three medals, including two golds, at the Commonwealth Games. The second of those golds, in the scratch race in Birmingham in 2022, came a day after she thought it would be her final race amid a \"serious confidence crisis\". Andy Anson, chief executive officer of the British Olympic Association, said what Kenny had achieved is \"nothing short of extraordinary\".  He added: \"Her talent, dedication, resilience and brilliant personality will have inspired many and I have no doubt will continue to do so over years to come.  \"She is a true legend of British Olympic sport.\" Kenny, made a Dame in the 2021 New Year's Honours, said she was \"open to doing anything and everything\" in the next chapter of her life. As for this summer's Olympics, Kenny said she hopes to be at the Games \"in some capacity\". Speaking earlier in March, before the news of Kenny's retirement, Park said he believed she would have \"an ongoing involvement\" with the GB cycling team \"for years to come\". \"There's nothing set in stone but there are things I'm so interested in doing,\" said Kenny. \"Something to help the younger generation, whether that could be some kind of academy. \"I could never be a coach because that's just too much pressure for me, but maybe something in the background that would help the youngsters have the opportunities I had.\" Kenny's former team-mates as well as other stars from the world of sport, sent well wishes via Instagram, with many calling her a \"legend\" of cycling.  Joanna Rowsell, who won team pursuit gold with Kenny in 2012 and 2016, congratulated her on a \"fabulous career\", and added: \"But most importantly thank you for ensuring there was never a dull moment on the journey.\" Dani Rowe, who was also part of the team pursuit quartet in London, wrote a long tribute to their friendship, highlighting the fact Kenny had pushed her to be \"the best I could be\".  She added: \"But most of all thank you for being you. You haven't changed one bit. Even after all of your success. I'm SO proud of you, on and off the bike.\"  Four-time Tour de France champion Chris Froome called Kenny's career \"spectacular\", while 2012 Olympic heptathlon gold medallist Dame Jessica Ennis-Hill said: \"You are such a legend, always will be and you will continue inspiring.\"  Road cyclist Mark Cavendish echoed Ennis-Hill's words when he wrote: \"The way you lead and grow a group of people has always been so, so impressive.\"  The 38-year-old, who will seek to break the Tour de France's stage wins record later this year, added: \"Thank you for everything you have done for British sport.\""

        "description": "Two-time Paralympic champion Lora Fachie says becoming a mother has challenged her as an athlete in new ways.",
        "text": " Two-time Paralympic champion Lora Fachie says becoming a mother has challenged her as an athlete in new ways. Fachie, who is married to fellow Para-cyclist and Paralympic champion Neil, gave birth to son Fraser in November 2022, and told BBC Sport that motherhood is the hardest thing she has ever done. \"Pushing your body to the limit in training is hard and painful, but you are the one in control,\" said the 35-year-old.  \"As a parent, you aren't necessarily in control and babies don't come with a manual so you are constantly having to adjust and reassess and change plans.  \"I was an athlete who likes a plan and sticks to it and I am quite a logical thinker and babies don't do that, so it tests you, especially in the early days.\" Both Lora and Neil will be hoping for more success at the Para-cycling Track World Championships which start on Wednesday in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, where they will be watched by Fraser. They will be part of a 27-strong British team, which also includes Jody Cundy, Kadeena Cox and Jaco van Gass with all of the riders bidding to put in strong performances to help earn selection for this summer's Paris Paralympics. The Fachies, who both have visual impairments, provided one of the memorable moments of the Tokyo Games in 2021 when they both won gold within the space of an hour - first Neil and sighted pilot Matt Rotherham claimed victory in the B 1,000m time trial before Lora and Corrine Hall won the B 3km individual pursuit. But those celebrations seemed a long way away in the early days of parenthood with challenges around Fraser's birth and struggles around breastfeeding which prompted Lora to speak out - a move which helped open up a wider conversation around the subject. \"I wish I could go back to me of 12 months ago and say it will all be fine, but when you are living with it and caught up in it, it's very hard, but things are definitely much better now,\" she reflects. \"I don't deal with failure very well, I know that, so it was just one knock after another and it took me to take a complete step back from it and change how we fed Fraser. Sometimes change is good and after that both of us started to thrive.\" Neil says: \"For Lora to speak out was incredible. It was really heart-warming to hear all the stories from others who got in touch, some who were struggling, others who had gone through it but it was a community coming together. \"We thought it was a really important message to put out there. It was raw, it was hard but I think it helped Lora to process it. It certainly helped me to speak about it.\" As well as motherhood, Lora also had to deal with returning to training and competition and she made her comeback to action at last year's World Championships in Glasgow, just eight months after giving birth.  She won a silver medal in the B individual pursuit with Hall, but was critical of British Cycling's treatment around her return, saying she felt, external she had been \"punished\" for having a baby and had been left \"isolated\" and with a \"lack of support\".  The organisation referred itself to an independent investigation, but before this year's events in Rio and Paris, Lora says she has seen positive changes. \"British Cycling have supported me around travelling out to Rio so I can stay close to Fraser and I can still see him whenever and help out if necessary,\" she says. \"It is with the aim of preparing both of us - me more so than Fraser, because he will be with his grandparents and will have a great time - for Paris where I might not get to see him as much as I would like because of security. \"The Paralympics is a very different experience and I want to make sure if I go to Paris, I am in the best shape I can be. \"Sometimes you have to be a little bit selfish. But knowing that he is happy and thriving with my parents is important so I can focus and do what I need to do. \"I would love to win gold in Rio but I just want to make sure I secure my place on the team for Paris.\" The couple are awaiting an official diagnosis to confirm that Fraser has a visual impairment. Lora says that there is no guarantee that he will follow his parents on to the back of a tandem in the future. \"People ask me if we have got Fraser a bike yet. We have got him a trike but I don't want him to be a cyclist - I want him to be his own person,\" she says. \"I don't want him to have to live in the shadow of Neil and I. I want him to find his own way. If it is cycling I will support him but I would rather he found his own thing - sport or music or whatever it is that makes him happy. \"He is becoming his own little person and developing his own personality. He is so funny and having that to come home to is so refreshing. I've never laughed as much as I do now, even when you are doing the most stupid things just to get a laugh from him. \"It is the best drug in the world.\" Revealing the truth about the stories that matter: Reporter Rory Carson meets the caravan park residents  There's a million ways to get it wrong: John Wilson presents a superbly strange guide to modern life"

        "text": " This article contains references to child abuse, drug addiction and suicidal thoughts. If you have been affected by any of the issues raised, visit BBC Action line. As Felipe Nystrom approaches the hill, the cheers swell. His bike sliding and squelching through the mud, he reaches the bottom and jumps off, shouldering the frame. Hundreds of fans urge him on as he struggles up the steep slope, cycling shoes sliding backwards as he edges forwards and upwards.  Far behind the other competitors, Nystrom reaches the top. He pauses, standing in silhouette against the wintery sun, and acknowledges the crowd. They return his salute with yet more cheers. Nystrom's journey to these moments on a muddy cyclocross course in the south of the Netherlands has been traumatic and painful. It has encompassed mental despair, homelessness, and attempted suicide.  LISTEN: Coming last and still getting the biggest cheers - Felipe Nystrom's story It is a tale he is determined to tell, to help others who may be as desperate now as he once was. \"All I want is one person,\" Nystrom says. \"One person to know that you can come out from under the grasp of addiction and alcoholism. It's going to be the hardest thing you ever did, but you can do it.\" Nystrom was born in Costa Rica, the son of a local father and an American mother who had moved there with the Peace Corps, a United States government agency for international development.  His mother's work as a volunteer and aid worker meant he was often looked after by different people at short notice. In his early years, that made him vulnerable. Nystrom describes desperately trying to hide in a drawer from one man who had taken to viciously beating him. He also has childhood memories of being sexually abused. None of those who Nystrom remembers abusing him ever faced charges or punishment. \"For the first eight years of my life, I think I lived in just panic, in terror, like every time the door opened, I didn't know what was going to happen,\" says Nystrom. \"I was almost like this feeling of complete helplessness. There is nothing I could do.\" As he grew older, the abuse stopped, but its effects lingered. Nystrom was awkward and withdrawn, frequently in conflict at home and bullied at school.  The only time he felt comfortable was on the sports field; playing football, doing gymnastics and, as he puts it now, \"anything to stay out of the house\". By his late teens, Nystrom had developed into a decent footballer and thought he might have a chance to make it as a professional. But injury set him back and, instead of working on his recovery, he gave up his dreams. \"I thought sports were going to be the thing - 'I'm going to be a professional soccer player and it's going to be great',\" he says. \"And then I couldn't really play anymore, and I think that was the moment, [at age] 18 or 19 I was so lost. \"I had no idea where I was going. I remember thinking, 'Well, I did everything I could, in soccer and sports, to make this happen. And now even that's gone. \"I've been good and still nothing good happens, maybe I should just party like everybody else.\" As he digested the end of his sporting hopes, Nystrom started down the road which was to define his life.  By now in his late teens, Nystrom discovered a party scene around the electronic music that he loved.  Aided by drink and drugs, it came with the acceptance he craved. \"I went from being not popular to 'Oh, this guy is the life of the party' and 'This guy's cool',\" he said.  \"People were messaging me. 'Hey, man, we're going to go drink, let's go!' or 'We're going to get ecstasy' or whatever.\" That awkward, angry young man, traumatised by the abuse he had suffered as a child, had found a way to fit in. But while most people indulged themselves now and again, Nystrom found that he didn't want to put the brakes on. He found the first in a series of jobs working in call centres taking bets from the United States, where, in most states, it was still illegal to gamble.  A reliable telecommunications network and a large bilingual workforce had made Costa Rica a go-to destination for the backroom operations of a booming online gaming industry that bypassed American laws. It was an environment as soaked in drugs and alcohol as the clubs he had begun going to. \"At first, a gram of cocaine would last me a week, maybe two weeks,\" says Nystrom. \"Then only a week, then half a week, [and] then I was taking breaks at work to go do bumps of cocaine.\" Nystrom remembers a colleague warning that cocaine was \"white death\". But he wasn't interested. \"It was cool, it was dangerous, and I was like 'I'm so sneaky, nobody can tell',\" he remembers.  \"It was something that I would think about, years later, when I was lying on the street. I was like 'Man, that guy was right'.\" At least partly aware of the road he was travelling, Nystrom describes how hard he tried to resist temptation, only inevitably to give in. \"My brain [was] saying 'I don't want to do drugs today' and my body on autopilot was walking from my apartment to the payphone to call my dealer,\" he says.  \"And all the way thinking 'No, don't do it. Don't do it. Don't do it.' But it was like I could not control myself. I had to get to the payphone.\" He began to hallucinate: hearing voices, imagining he was being tracked on the street or being monitored by microphones and cameras secretly installed at his home. \"It was horrible, horrible, horrible, horrible. I was losing touch with reality,\" he says. No longer able or interested in going to work, he lost the last of his jobs, ran out of places to stay, and found himself on the street. He was there for more than a year - sleeping in alleyways, begging for money, scavenging for food. Staff at one of the local fast-food restaurants would sometimes leave a bag of tacos next to the bin at the end of the day. \"And all the time, [I] was begging for money, to go do drugs. It was all about the drugs,\" Nystrom says. Even in such extreme circumstances, bitter memories of his previous life broke through. Nystrom sometimes used discarded newspapers to try to keep warm. \"I remember looking at a newspaper and seeing the sports section, and pictures of guys that I grew up playing soccer with, were now on the national team,\" he says. After more than a year of living on the streets, with seemingly no way out from his addiction and wracked with guilt about abandoning a young son whose mother he had separated from before the birth, Nystrom came to the desperate decision to end his life. \"I knew I couldn't stop. It didn't work. And so finally I decided, I can't do this anymore,\" he says. He had tried several times in the past, but this time, on this day - 27 September 2012 - he says, he meant it: \"As soon as it was light, I went and started begging for money. I managed to get enough to buy what I thought would be enough drugs to die. I hadn't put that much effort into anything in years. There was no way I was going to be alive the next day. \"I went into a used clothing store and stole a pair of jeans, and then I stole a polo shirt, because I didn't want them to find me in rags. I had just enough money left to check myself into a cheap motel, so I could take a shower, because when they found me, I wanted to be clean. \"The last thing I remember was thinking that I needed to buy more beer. The next thing is opening my eyes and seeing two paramedics in front of me.  \"There was this incredible rush of emotions: anger was the first one. Then fear and sadness because this was supposed to be it, I wasn't supposed to be alive anymore.  \"I remember trying to fight and the guy hugging me. It was the first time I'd been hugged in I don't know how many years. He just held me while I was trying to fight him and said 'It's going to be OK. I don't know how. But it's going to be OK'.\" Nystrom's life had been saved by a concerned motel receptionist who came to check on him and called the emergency services. Before that last suicide attempt, he had sworn that this was the end and, if, somehow, he found himself still living, he would do what was needed to change. That decision was reinforced when he witnessed a grieving family in the hospital in which he was recovering. He can't explain why they had such an impact on him. He had seen much violence and pain before, but this time, for some reason, it was different. \"It was like this weight that I had been carrying for who knows how long had been lifted,\" he says. \"Like I finally knew what I needed to do, where I was going to go.\" He headed to a rehab centre in San Jose, where the staff were clear. They would give him food, a bed, but no second chances. If he failed to follow their rules, if he slipped up, he was out and on his own. \"I'm alive today because of those people,\" Nystrom says.  He describes the blissful feeling of simply falling asleep - as opposed to passing out through intoxication or exhaustion - but also the physical pain he felt as his body adjusted to a life without drugs. There was temptation. He considered sneaking out and joining a party which was going on just over the wall from the treatment centre. Part of his brain told him, now he'd made a start, he could manage his recovery on his own. But, somehow, the moment for him to quit the programme never came. He stayed the course and started the long climb to a different life. The first stage was another hospital in another country. After six months of rehabilitation, Nystrom met a woman from Portland in the United States and decided to move back with her to Oregon. The relationship didn't last, but the job he found has. For the past 10 years, Nystrom has worked as a translator, helping Spanish-speaking patients navigate treatment. He delivers good and bad news, makes sure they are understood by the medical staff and that they understand what is happening to them. From the very first shift, when he helped a Guatemalan woman who had just lost her baby, he realised he'd discovered a way to contribute. \"I was walking out of the hospital, and I said, 'This is what I need to be doing, this is how I'm going to start paying back society'\". \"When my colleagues say 'we couldn't have done it without you.' That's a very different kind of acknowledgement than when the dealer was like 'hey, man thanks for coming to see me'.\" Nystrom also reconnected with his son. He had gone to see him for the first time in years just before he left for the States. \"I don't know how much he understood, but that day I said, 'look man, I really messed up. I failed. I failed as a father. I haven't been there for you',\" he says. \"But for the rest of my life, I'm going to do everything I can to make sure you have everything you need. And I had no idea how I was going to do it. I didn't know if I could do it. But I made him that promise.\" Nystrom worked intensely, earning as much as possible to pay back what he owed his son. \"For the first couple of years all I did was work, work, work, work. And there was in a way no temptation, because I just didn't have time for it. \"I didn't want to meet people because I didn't know how to meet people. I realised I didn't know how normal people have conversations.\" Eventually though, Nystrom realised he did need something beyond work. He tried football, but the old passion wasn't there. He tried triathlon, but hated the swimming. The cycling though was fun. Not least because Nystrom turned out to be extremely good. Even though he was in his thirties, racing people sometimes 20 years younger than him, Nystrom roared through the categories - going from beginner to Category One - the highest level of amateur competition - in a single season.  I put it to Nystrom at this point that what he had achieved so far - a life turned around, a renewed connection with his son, continuing recovery, a job he was committed to and, with cycling, a satisfying social life - would be enough for most people. But Nystrom is not most people, which is why his next move was to take his sport \"a little more seriously\" and show his son what work and belief can bring. \"I can go down to Costa Rica three or four times a year, whatever, but it's not the same as being there 100% of the time,\" Nystrom says. \"I thought 'how can I give my son a lesson he will never forget, about never giving up on your dreams?'.\" In 2019, Nystrom entered Costa Rica's elite national road racing championship. And won it. His first thoughts after claiming the crown were about his son.   \"I guess it was maybe the first time in my life that I felt like I had made him proud,\" he says now. In the aftermath, he found himself telling his personal story for the first time publicly and the idea formed that by speaking out, he might be able to help others, as well as his son. Nystrom went looking for another challenge and found it in cyclo-cross.  Cyclo-cross is a discipline in which riders tackle a looped course, mostly off-road, that takes them through mud and sand, over steep hills, around tight turns and - as a winter discipline - in whatever the weather throws at them. Nystrom hated it at first: \"It was cold, it was wet, it was muddy. They put things on the course to make you get off the bike. No!\" But, with the 2022 cyclo-cross world championships due to be held in the United States, specifically Fayetteville in Arkansas, it was a stage for his message. He lobbied the Costa Rican federation to put him in for the event, even though there was no history of cyclo-cross in the country. Eventually, after he committed to raising all the necessary funds himself, they allowed him to enter, and, wearing his national kit, he got his first taste of international competition. There was no fairytale finish this time. Nystrom came last in the men's elite race. But there was at least a finish. Nystrom was classified. He completed the course and told his story. \"If somebody expects me to give them a result in one of these races, they don't know about cycling,\" Nystrom says. \"But it's not about that. I'm a guy, 40 years old, that works 12 to 15 hours, sometimes 18 hours a day to self-fund this crazy idea of going to race at the highest level.\" It's that commitment, plus his extraordinary life story, which has earned Nystrom the support over three cyclo-cross seasons, including racing in the sport's heartland of Belgium and the Netherlands. \"It's just been incredible. It is just so unbelievable the amount of support the fans give me,\" Nystrom says. \"You know, they're spending their money, their time to come and see the best of the best. And then also cheer for me and I'm so grateful for that.  \"And I'm especially thankful to the racers as well because I'm sure it would be very easy for one of them to say, 'why is this guy here?'. \"They've afforded me a spot on their starting grid - that for me is bigger than any result that I'll ever get in one of these races.\" That respect was shown when Nystrom was involved in an incident with multiple world champion Mathieu van der Poel at the end of last year. The Costa Rican accidentally stepped into Van der Poel's path after stopping for a selfie with fans. The Dutchman had to push him out of the way. There was a flurry of negative comment but Van der Poel was clear. Nystrom, the world number one said, \"should not give up on his dream\". , external As you can hopefully tell, Nystrom is open, relaxed and charming.  It's hard to imagine him as a once-broken man - bowed down under the weight of despair. He feels uncomfortable about his own honesty and revealing the difficult details of his life. \"It's embarrassing,\" he says when I ask how he feels about telling his story. He doesn't renounce his past, jokingly admitting that there is a relationship, however distant, between the commitment he now gives cycling and his previous addiction to drugs and alcohol.  \"Before I spent all my money trying to buy as many grams as I could. Now I spend all my money trying to lose all the grams I can!\" he says of his 'all-in' character and his attempts to secure comparable kit to the rest of the elite field. It takes him more than an hour to walk back across the course in Hulst, stopping for selfies and chats with the fans who had been cheering him on during the race, giving time to everyone who wants it. Later he sits down for this interview, going over some of the most painful and intimate details of his life with a complete stranger. It is his way of trying to share the good fortune he feels, and of making a difference to somebody else's life. \"Somewhere out there, there is somebody who is suffering the same way I did,\" he says.  \"That's the person that I hope to reach.\" Death, disaster and redemption - England's tumultuous tour of India Rider, runner, winner - the second coming of Christian Meier Bomb shelter or Centre Court, Svitolina fights on Torvill, Dean and the death of romance Sin City to Sports Town USA - how Vegas fell for sport"

        "text": " Anna Shackley, one of Britain's most talented young cyclists, has been forced to retire aged 22 because of heart issues. The Scot is the reigning British Under-23 road race champion and won bronze in the under-23 event at last year's World Championships in Glasgow. She was diagnosed with cardiac arrhythmia in January and after further tests has been advised to retire. \"To say I'm devastated would be a huge understatement,\" Shackley said. \"Cycling has been my entire life for as long as I can remember and unfortunately it has come to a premature ending.\" Shackley competed for Team GB at the Tokyo Olympics as a 20-year-old and won under-23 silver at the European Championships. Further notable results include finishing 13th in the general classification at the Giro d'Italia and seventh overall at the Tour de Romandie. \"I had many plans and ambitions for the future and that being taken away from me has been very hard,\" she said. \"However, I count myself lucky to have had the unique experience of being a professional in [my] hobby. Wee Anna would never have believed that.\" Danny Stam, sports manager for Shackley's SD Worx-Protime team, said: \"We are very sorry to see Anna's cycling career end like this.  \"She was one of the bigger talents in the women's peloton.  \"We saw in recent years that she was making good progress and we believed she could grow to the world top.\""

        "text": " Sign up for notifications to the latest Insight features via the BBC Sport app and find the latest in the series here. It is early spring 2021 in Girona, Spain in the middle of yet another Covid-19 lockdown.  Exercise is permitted, but only in the local municipality.  A recent retiree is, like millions of people all over the globe, taking his first steps into running in a bid to break the boredom. He's been riding his bike locally but is fed up with just pedalling \"around the block\". Within minutes of pulling on his trainers and leaving his apartment, he is aiming for the foothills of the Pyrenees. And here's where his story diverges from the typical lockdown tale of two-footed trudging. Rather than struggle, the Canadian is relishing the moment, recognising a familiar power and strength in his legs as the trail climbs upwards and the mountains beckon beyond. Christian Meier first felt that strength nearly 20 years earlier in Canada.  Growing up, he was a keen mountain biker. Living in the shadow of the Appalachians, he would head to the hills on two wheels, rather than two feet. In the mid-2000s, he crossed the Atlantic and switched disciplines; moving to Europe to pursue a career in professional road cycling.  Meier was to race as a professional for more than 10 years, riding all three Grand Tours including the Tour de France, and becoming well known as a reliable domestique for a number of World Tour teams, latterly the Australian outfit GreenEdge. The role of a domestique is to ride in service of others: to deliver the stars to the finish line in the best condition and position to sparkle.  Meier was not only good at it, but he also enjoyed the selflessness anonymity of riding for the good of his team leader rather than for himself. He wasn't in it for victories. \"I wanted to be a domestique,\" he says. \"I just wanted to ride on the front, ride for a sprinter or pull on the climbs.\" He also relished the 'flow state' of endurance exercise - the feeling of being able to simply exist, in a state just below your physical limits.   \"I don't think I don't necessarily like the word suffering,\" he says.  \"When people say you go out there and you just suffer all day, I think that's kind of misunderstood.  \"When I'm in my zone and out there doing my thing, in that context, suffering is actually not a good thing. I shouldn't be suffering; I should be in control.  \"I really enjoyed being in that zone. Each moment of flow is quite addictive because it's such an incredible place to be. You are just in the moment, just focusing on what you're doing right now.\" Fast forward to a warm, sunny day in early 2024 and Meier is back in his happy place, tapping out kilometres on the front of a group of athletes heading uphill.  He looks completely at home on the move. His relaxed face belies the physical exertion he is putting his followers through.  It all sounds very familiar, but there's one crucial difference: Meier is not leading out a cycling peloton. Rather, it is a group of trail runners, heading up into the Girona hills. From the beginning of his lockdown journey, Meier knew he was on to something - something new that had sprung from the old. \"Straight away there was this satisfaction of running uphill pretty well,\" he said. \"From doing so much cycling, there were instantly things that I was good at.  \"Going uphill, that was just power, and I was good at that.  \"Spain had a pretty hardcore lockdown when we were first allowed out to exercise; you had to stay within the municipality. It didn't make sense to even go riding. But you had the hills to go running in.  \"Running meant you could have a good workout and not get bored riding around the same block. \"When I first started running, did I really think I'd get to the point of being a professional athlete again? Probably not. \"But following your heart, the evolution, and really loving it, loving the training again\u00e2\u0080\u00a6it became a snowball that kept going.\" By his own admission Meier was not a winner on the bike.  But in the summer of 2023, only two years after his first steps proper on two trail-running feet, he won the prestigious TDS race in Chamonix. It's a 150km race from Courmayeur in Italy to Chamonix, France, which starts at midnight and has more than 9,000m of climbing. Last summer's race, despite being run in June, featured snow and poor visibility, forcing the organisers to add eight kilometres to the route on safety grounds.  It is contested in the same week as the most famous trail running race of all - the Ultra Trail du Mont Blanc - and, in terms of prestige, is considered just one rung below. Given many of his peers have been racing the trails for more than a decade, Meier sent shockwaves through the sport with his victory.  Meier is back from leading his Girona group run now and is busy making a drink.  We're supposed to be discussing his running career but instead we're talking coffee. The brew is delicious. It illustrates a part of Meier's character that has been integral to his burgeoning new career in trail running. Meier loves to \"geek out\" on new things and is therefore fastidiously making drinks inside the first of two coffee shops that he owns and runs with his wife in Girona. He was still racing professionally when they set up the business in 2015. He quit cycling a year later, aged just 31, in a sport where riders can continue into their forties. Despite having a year to run on a lucrative professional contract, coffee and entrepreneurship was his new obsession. \"It got to the point in cycling where I started to feel like I was doing the same races, and getting too comfortable,\" he said then. \"l felt like I was no longer growing. At the same time, with coffee, everything was so new and so young and there was huge scope for me to grow and move forward.\" Speaking now, he adds: \"I think it's that Buddhist concept of just having a child's mind more in your life. A child's mind is full of curiosity; it has not yet had things imposed about what you can and can't do.  \"As a child, your imagination is: 'I want to go to the moon'. But most people maybe pick something easier to do, you know?  \"But I just have a mindset of firstly being a little naive and then, just going for it.  \"Sometimes being naive helps you make those steps and then you figure out the roadblocks as you go.\" Meier's running roadblocks were twofold.  His first issue was injury. In cardiovascular terms, he was in incredible shape to make the transition, with a huge capacity to absorb oxygen, lactic and pain.  But his body was underdeveloped for the demands that were now being placed on different muscle groups. The impact of sole hitting soil in his new sport caused Meier to break down on multiple occasions. \"When I started running, most of my life had been doing endurance sport. The cardio side of things is very transferable,\" he says. \"But from a muscular standpoint, it was terrible. I had so many injuries early on. I took a long time to adapt.  \"Road cyclists are just weaklings to be honest.\"  He also struggled to cope when the trails weren't following an upward incline. Meier's entrepreneurship has extended to a sustainable clothing brand. He says his co-founder - an English businessman called Tom Austen, without any professional sporting pedigree - would \"smash\" him on their training runs if the terrain was right. \"I'd go running on the flat and people would just drop me,\" Meier says. \"We were doing 10km time trials and Tom was beating me by 40 seconds. \"Tom was fit, but I'm definitely fitter. But he was smashing me on the flat. I realised I've got so much to learn.\" Typically, Meier leaned into the learning. \"I was reading, reading and reading about the sport, watching YouTube videos and doing whatever I could,\" he says.  \"I just wanted to absorb as much information as I could about this new thing.\"  Meier coaches himself and is studying for his coaching badges. While he has discovered there is common ground between his new sport and cycling physiologically, tactically there is less. \"There's not a lot of cunning about: How am I going to win today?\" Meier says of his trail-running strategy.  \"Essentially you just need to be as fit as possible. You show up and you run your strategy. That's how ultrarunning works.  \"If you see someone and they're struggling a bit on the descent, maybe you push a bit there - but it's not like cycling, where you might sit in the wheel all day.\"   There is less cunning and still plenty of that child-like naivety. \"My first big race was 50 kilometres and I remember just thinking, man alive, I'm going to run 50 kilometres,\" he remembers. \"It felt insane. Then thinking about running 100 miles on foot in the mountains - the feeling of that is just wild. For a lot of people a 100-mile bike ride is a big ride.  \"I didn't ride bikes to win. So winning the TDS was definitely the highlight of my sporting career for sure. \"To win\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 it felt more like a dream.\" Bomb shelter or Centre Court, Svitolina fights on Torvill, Dean and the death of romance From Sin City to Sports Town USA - how Vegas fell for sport From Paris to the world - football's hottest talent factory New wave - how one surf club is changing Ghana"

        "text": " World Athletics' decision to award prize money at the Paris Olympics goes against the Olympic spirit, says the head of cycling's governing body. World Athletics will become the first federation to offer prize money at an Olympics this summer. Gold medallists in athletics events will earn $50,000 (\u00c2\u00a339,400). \"The Olympic spirit is to share revenues and have more athletes compete worldwide,\" UCI president David Lappartient said. \"Not only [to] put all the money on the top athletes but spread the money. \"If we concentrate money on top athletes, a lot of opportunities will disappear for athletes all over the world.\" Given the Olympics' origins as an amateur sports event, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) does not award prize money but distributes funding through international federations (IF) and national Olympic committees (NOC). World Athletics' move, which will be extended to silver and bronze medallists for the 2028 Games, was widely praised by former athletes when it was announced by its president Lord Coe. Asked at the time if prize money went against the Olympic spirit, Coe said: \"I don't see that making life a little easier for the athletes, allowing them maybe to stay on in the sport a little bit longer, to give them the financial independence to train, and maybe in a more sophisticated way is anything other than sitting behind good firm Olympic principles.\" But on Tuesday Lappartient said: \"We really believe that this is not the Olympic spirit. \"The proposal was not discussed.\""

        "text": " St Helens bounced back from their Challenge Cup exit as they thrashed Hull FC to go top of Super League. The hosts led through Tommy Makinson crossing in the corner and Jonny Lomax touched down soon after. Waqa Blake and James Bell went over to extend Saints' lead and Joe Batchelor ran in a fifth try after half-time. Mark Percival, Konrad Hurrell and Curtis Sironen added to Hull's woes as Blake's second broke the 50-point mark before Jack Welsby added a 10th try. Saints are now top of a tight table on points difference from second-placed Wigan and Catalans who drop from first to third.  Hull came into the match off the back of sacking head coach Tony Smith with half-back Fa'amanu Brown and full-back Tex Hoy following him in leaving the club. Richie Myler also took over as director of rugby prior to the trip to the Totally Wicked Stadium during a chaotic period of change for the Super League strugglers. However, interim coaches Simon Grix and Francis Cummins could not stop Hull's seventh defeat in eight league games. St Helens had suffered a chastening loss to the Wire in the Challenge Cup quarter-final on Sunday after a second half capitulation against Sam Burgess' side, but there was to be no repeat in a resolute performance where they rarely looked threatened. Their opener came in stylish fashion as a succession of passes, starting with Lomax's offload, eventually saw Hurrell feed Makinson to touch down. Hull FC were carved open again inside the opening quarter of an hour as Sione Mata'utia sent Lomax through with ease while some quick hands under pressure saw Saints keep the ball alive to send Blake through for their third. Bell soon weaved his way past a dejected Hull defence to make it 24-0 at the break. Saints picked up from where they left off in the second half as Lomax sent Batchelor through with a move straight off the training ground. Lomax teed up another Saints try as he set Percival up to follow up his fine work with the boot and Hurrell later continued the rout on his 100th Super League appearance. Sironen crashed over just before the hour mark and Blake ran in virtually unopposed for his second before Welsby cut in to wrap up a thumping victory. Hull FC interim coach Simon Grix told BBC Radio Humberside: \"If you judge the game on the scoreboard alone it's not pretty, obviously. I think our effort was good, especially our young lads. I told them to come with enthusiasm and energy. \"I think we came undone through inexperience at times against a determined and relentless St Helens team who were really good and you tell they were hurting and they did a really professional job tonight. \"For what I asked of them, I wasn't judging them on the scoreboard tonight.  \"Obviously we all want the two points but we're not there at the moment. We need to get our effort and talent to where it needs to be and I don't think it was far off tonight.\" St Helens: Bennison; Makinson, Hurrell, Percival, Blake; Welsby, Lomax; Mata'utia, Mbye, Lees, Whitley, Batchelor, Knowles Interchanges: Bell, Sironen, Delaney, Davies.

        "text": " London Broncos remain without a Super League win this season after falling to a home defeat to 12-man Salford. The hosts took the lead after 19 minutes when Iliess Macani scored in the corner, before Kallum Watkins replied six minutes later. Deon Cross made it 12-4 to Salford early in the second half before the Broncos' Will Lovell was sin-binned. Salford had King Vuniyayawa sent-off for a tip tackle on 55 minutes but the Broncos failed to capitalise. Broncos, without a win or point in Super League this season after the opening eight matches, will see this as a huge missed opportunity after playing against 12 men for 25 minutes. They failed to score or unduly threaten Salford in the period when they enjoyed a numerical advantage. It was Salford, who remain seventh, who almost won by a greater margin but Tim Lafai's try was ruled out after a lengthy check. Warrington fightback downs struggling Leigh Super League table The afternoon had started brightly for the hosts and they took the lead after 19 minutes when Macani went over when the ball was moved wide from a scrum but Bill Leyland's kick hit the post. Salford hit back six minutes later when Ryan Brierley burst through a gap before sending skipper Watkins over the line, with Marc Sneyd's conversion putting the visitors 6-4 up. Sneyd had the chance to grab another shortly before the half-hour mark but could not hold on to Cross' pass and the visitors took a two-point advantage into the break. But it took Salford only three minutes after the restart to score their second try when Cross collected a looping pass to finish acrobatically in the corner and Sneyd stretched the lead to eight points. Things took another turn for the worse for the Broncos when Will Lovell was sin-binned for a dangerous tackle on Lafai, which left the Salford man needing treatment.  The Red Devils then went down a man themselves when Vuniyayawa was shown a red card for a tip tackle on Marcus Stock. However, despite losing Vuniyayawa, it was Salford who came closest to adding to the scoreline, but Joe Shorrocks was held up short before Lafai's late effort was ruled out. Broncos director of rugby Mike Eccles: \"Credit to them, we could not generate ruck speed and we wanted to move the ball but we couldn't do that. \"Yeah, massively (missed opportunity).\" Red Devils boss Paul Rowley: \"We're satisfied that we defended well for periods of the game. \"I thought our attitude to defence, which we needed an appetite to build the win on, I thought we had that. There was some positives. \"This group are honest people and quick to recognise flaws. We're not as sharp as we like at this present time, we're working extremely hard and we're fighting at the right end of the table.\" London: Adebiyi, Bassett, Boafo, Butler, Davis, Hughes, Jones, Kennedy, Kershaw, Leyland, Lovell, Macani, Makin. Interchanges: Meadows, Miloudi, Parata, Stock. Salford: Atkin, Brierley, Cross, Dixon, Dudson, Foster, Lafai, MacDonald, Mellor, Morgan, Ormondroyd, Partington, Cust.

        "text": " Hull FC have appointed newly retired former England and Ireland half-back Richie Myler as director of rugby on a three-year deal. The 33-year-old called time on his career, which finished with York, after a troublesome elbow injury. Myler is responsible for on-field performance of the senior and academy set-ups, as well as the recruitment of players and coaching staff. One of his key roles will be to appoint a head coach after Tony Smith's exit. The Black and Whites have won just once this season, conceding 252 points in seven Super League games and were knocked out of the Challenge Cup in the sixth round. Lee Radford's back-to-back Challenge Cup wins as boss back in 2016 and 2017 remain the club's last trophies, while they have not reached the play-offs since 2020. \"Hull FC is a huge rugby league club steeped in history with a truly loyal fanbase,\" Myler said. \"There is no shying away from the fact that the club has lost some of its identity on the field with recent performances. \"The word rebuild has been mentioned to me over the last few days and whilst I understand the task in front of us I'm already tired of that phrase.\" With overseas quota spots available after Tex Hoy and Nu Brown both left Hull in the wake of Smith's departure, Hull and Myler can make moves in the transfer market. Another key component will be the retention of existing talent, and nurturing potential stars who have begun to emerge at Hull such as Jack Charles, Davy Litten, Will Gardiner and Lewis Martin. \"The club has many promising young players on the books who clearly have a big future at the club and it's vital that we develop and retain them,\" said Myler.  \"We also need to add more quality with experienced players and that will form a major part of my role. I am genuinely excited by the task ahead as we all look to pull together and once again seek to restore the club's fortunes on the pitch.\" When the rumours about Myler surfaced over the weekend, the BBC Sport pundits covering the Challenge Cup game discussed the challenge he would face should he take on the Hull job. \"I don't think it's a quick fix this, it'll take someone with a lot of credentials and qualifications,\" Salford captain Ryan Brierley said on BBC Sport. \"Whether Richie is that man remains to be seen.\" Former New Zealand international Robbie Hunter-Paul also made a switch from playing roster to operations when he served as Bradford chief executive. \"It's a baptism of fire - there's a new coach in which he would be tasked with the responsibility of putting in place,\" Hunter-Paul said. \"That can be the little lighting of the fire which can become the inferno. They seem to have the nucleus of a squad out there, they just need something to turn it around and this could be it.\" Myler's retirement ends an 18-year career in rugby league which started at Widnes and took in spells at Salford, Warrington, Catalans Dragons and Leeds before York. He had scored 208 tries in 401 senior games including eight in eight for England, while he represented Ireland at the last World Cup. Myler scored two tries in his three games for York after joining from Leeds, before the injury struck. During his career, Myler was a Lance Todd Trophy winner with Leeds in their 2020 Challenge Cup success and also won the cup at Warrington. His transfer to Warrington from Salford in 2009 was rumoured to be the most expensive fee paid for a teenager, as he signed for a combined \u00c2\u00a3300,000 along with Wakefield centre Ryan Atkins.

        "text": " Leeds Rhinos began the 2024 Women's Super League season in style as Evie Cousins, Zoe Hornby and Lucy Murray all scored a hat-trick of tries in a 66-4 demolition of Huddersfield Giants. Rhinos led 36-4 at the break, with Amelia Brown scoring what turned out to be the Giants' solitary try. Caitlin Beevers added two tries of her own, while Ruby Enright and Sophie Robinson also contributed to the rout. Elsewhere on Friday, Wigan beat Barrow 18-4 in their own opening game. In an even first half at the DW Stadium, neither side could get off the mark, but three minutes into the second half Anna Davies put Wigan ahead. Davies registered another try after Isabel Rowe added herself to the scoresheet, while Kaitlin Hilton rounded out the win for Denis Betts' side. Michelle Larkin ran in an unconverted score late on as a consolation for the Raiders. Leeds took just two minutes to get off the mark when Hornby worked her way through the Giants' defence, with Ruby Enright going on to score one of her seven goals. Beevers, Cousins and Murray all scored twice before half-time as the hosts established their dominance with a 32-point advantage at Headingley. They picked up where they left off when full-back Enright raced in just four minutes into the second half. Murray completed her hat-trick first as she forced her way over with 47 minutes gone, and Robinson crossed eight minutes later. Not to be outdone, Cousins crossed on the right to bring up her own hat-trick, while Hornby touched down twice in three minutes to register another hat-trick for the hosts. It was another performance to remember for Cousins, who returned from a year's absence with injury to score twice in Leeds' Women's Challenge Cup quarter-final win over Warrington Wolves on Sunday."

        "text": " Warrington's ability to repel St Helens and book their Challenge Cup semi-final spot in Sunday's tie was a satisfying aspect, said captain George Williams. Williams and his team-mates kept Saints to just one try from Konrad Hurrell, while scoring five of their own. The England skipper rounded off an impressive win with his try, having already made some telling contributions in keeping Saints away from points. \"Our defence was probably most pleasing,\" Williams told BBC Sport. \"We worked hard on it in the pre-season. They've got strike all over the pitch and we nullified a lot of it.\" Matty Ashton's stunning acrobatic finish at the corner was the pick of the tries, as Warrington turned a tight encounter in their favour with a wave of points towards the end. Josh Thewlis had started the scoring before Saints replied through Hurrell, but Ashton, centre Connor Wrench and prop James Harrison racked up the points before ex-Wigan half Williams sealed it in the final minutes. \"It was really pleasing to come home strong at the end,\" Williams added. \"They are a top team. It was a good performance, it was in the balance for a fairly long time, it was a good game to watch and was tough out there.\" Huddersfield will be Warrington's semi-final opponents, a side that Tony Smith's 2009 Wire line-up beat at Wembley. The Giants have not lifted the trophy since 1953, albeit they were finalists in 2022, while Warrington's last cup triumph was against Saints in 2019. \"It'll be great - they beat Catalans pretty convincingly yesterday,\" Williams said of facing Huddersfield. \"It'll be a great tie and we'll be looking forward to that one.\" ABBA's definitive story: How much do you really know about Sweden\u00e2\u0080\u0099s biggest musical export?

The hosts were up 12-0 at the break but Saints battled back and led with just two minutes to play. However, Carrie Roberts crossed for her second score of the game to give them the two points. Elsewhere, Warrington beat promoted Featherstone 34-28. The Wire led 14-12 at the break before looking to have put the game beyond the West Yorkshire side with three unanswered tries to stretch their lead to 30-12. Rovers fought back though and closed to within two points thanks to scores from Alyssa Courtney, Olivia Grace and Fran Copley but Nicole Barnett made the points safe for the hosts with a late try. York went into the start of the league season off the back of a thumping 74-0 rout of Featherstone in the Challenge Cup quarter-final last week. They looked to be picking up where they had left off as scores from Roberts, Emma Kershaw and Tamzin Renouf put them in a commanding position at the break. Saints were narrowly beaten by Leeds in last season's play-off semi-final and showed their steel to come roaring back to lead with six minutes left through tries from Katie Mottershead, Leah Burke and Rachael Woosey. York did not lose a single league game on their way to a League Leaders' Shield and Grand Final double in 2023 and Roberts dived over in the corner in the 78th minute to break Saints hearts."

        "text": " Catalans Dragons moved to the top of Super League with a dominant seven-try win over Hull KR. Micky McIlorum put the hosts in front after six minutes but the Robins quickly replied through Joe Burgess.  The hosts then took control, scoring four more tries, including an excellent finish from Tom Davies, to lead 26-6 at half-time.  Dragons scored two late tries through Tom Johnstone and Tariq Sims as Rovers were kept scoreless in the second half. Les Dracs have now won their last eight home meetings with Hull KR, with Rovers' last away victory against them on 31 August 2019. It was the perfect response to French side's surprise heavy home defeat in the Challenge Cup against Huddersfield last weekend. Super League table Warrington fightback downs struggling Leigh Winless Broncos beaten by 12-man Salford Catalans opened the scoring as McIlorum burrowed over after Hull KR, without the injured Mikey Lewis, made an error to gift the hosts possession.  But the lead lasted only five minutes as the visitors responded strongly when Burgess spun out of a tackle to score in the corner, with Ben Reynolds' conversion levelling matters at 6-6. The hosts regained the advantage on 18 minutes with a slick move which saw Davies collect a looping pass before accelerating into space and feeding Matt Ikuvalu to cross the whitewash. Davies then took centre stage with an excellent one-handed finish, acrobatically leaping into the corner to dot down with defenders rushing across to tackle him. With the confidence flowing, Catalans began to dominate and Jordan Dezaria's close range score was followed by another excellent team move which was finished off by Theo Fages to give the hosts a commanding 26-6 half-time lead.  The break did the Robins good and they came out with more impetus in the second period but could find no way through the Catalans' resolute defence.  Hull KR were then reduced to 12 on 56 minutes when Matty Storton was yellow-carded for a tackle which put pressure on the neck of Johnstone. The Dragons winger was able to stay on the pitch to score his side's sixth try - and the first points of the second half - ten minutes before full-time before Tariq Sims rounded off the scoring by charging down a kick and dribbling the ball over the line to dot down. Defeat ends the Robins' three-match winning streak and they stay fifth on 10 points - four points behind their opponents and new Super League leaders Catalans.

        "text": " Matty Nicholson's late try helped Warrington come from behind to beat Leigh in a thrilling Super League contest.  The Leopards led at half-time thanks to Josh Charnley and Ben McNamara's tries, either side of Lachlan Fitzgibbon's first try for Warrington. Ricky Leutele's 48th-minute try put Leigh 14-6 up but The Wire responded through Matt Dufty in the 64th minute. Nicholson then finished a breakaway try to seal the win with 10 minutes left. The win moves Sam Burgess' side up to third on 12 points - level with St Helens and Wigan above them, although Catalans Dragons can go top if they beat Hull KR in Saturday's late kick-off. Super League table A minute's applause was held before kick-off in memory of former Warrington chairman and president Lord Doug Hoyle, who died aged 98 on 6 April. Leigh took the lead after only two minutes when the ball was moved wide to Charnley to dot down in the corner on his 350th career appearance but Matt Moylan sliced his kick wide. The Wire responded quickly and after Fitzgibbon had been tackled just short of the line he was not to be denied soon after as he collected a kick in behind to score his first try for the club and Josh Thewlis' conversion gave the hosts a 21st-minute lead. Leigh went back in front on 32 minutes when Umyla Hanley did well to catch a high kick in Wolves territory before offloading to Zak Hardaker who kicked on for McNamara to score.  Wolves thought they had hit back again four minutes before the break as Connor Wrench looked to be streaking in before a try-saving tackle from Oliver Holmes ensured Leigh led 10-6 at the break.   They stretched their lead eight minutes into the second period when some great link-up play between Moylan and Charnley led to an inside pass for Leutele who crashed over.  The Wire reduced the arrears with 15 minutes remaining when Fitzgibbon's powerful burst and offload to Dufty saw the full-back go over and Thewlis converted to make it 14-12 going into the closing stages. Dufty then turned from scorer to creator as his fine footwork created space for Thewlis to race away and find Nicholson to give the hosts a 16-14 lead in the 71st minute.  Leigh kept battling and almost found a winner but when the ball was moved wide to Hardaker in space he was unable to hold on to the pass. His struggling side stay in ninth, after a sixth defeat in seven Super League games this season. Warrington head coach Sam Burgess: \"We will never wave the white flag and roll over and our pre-season was designed with that in mind and not let us do that. I'm pleased with the win in a tough game and we looked pretty tired and flat at the start, so I'm happy for the team that they got the win. \"We had our moments in the game but probably weren't quite ourselves and we needed some great efforts to get the job done. \"It's hard to turn up and be physically ready each week, there are always going to be those little dips and I was really proud of their character. Leigh challenged us all day but I know we can stay in games and have the players who can come up with something.\" Leigh boss Adrian Lam: \"It was very disappointing, I'm heartbroken really as I thought we did enough to get the victory. It's the hope that kills you and obviously everybody is really flat after that, the dressing room is flat. \"I have questioned the group on why we couldn't score when we needed to the most because we have been able to do that in my time here to be able to kill games. \"As disappointed as I am, the lads put so much effort in and haven't got what they deserved. We have to stick with the process, no doubting each other or pointing fingers, we are in a strong position on and off the field. There are positive signs and the dressing room is really strong and well connected.\" Warrington: Dufty, Thewlis, Wrench, King, Ashton, Williams, Hayes, Harrison, Walker, Philbin, Nicholson, Fitzgibbon, Crowther.

        "text": " Huddersfield made it five straight wins in all competitions with a remarkable comeback win at Leeds. Giants twice rubbed out 12-point deficits with some fine rugby as Leeds imploded after a dominant first half. The visitors could even afford to see full-back Jake Connor's kicking game malfunction as he missed five out of eight. Heckled by the home fans, Connor edged his side ahead with a penalty and Adam Clune settled it with a breakaway try. Huddersfield looked flat in the first half following their stunning 34-6 Challenge Cup win at Super League leaders Catalans last week, and Leeds took full advantage. After a tight, cautious opening, livewire Leeds full-back Lachlan Miller sparked the game into life with a 40-metre run from his own in-goal area, and with Giants on the retreat the Rhinos pressed home their advantage for Paul Momirovski to go over. Huddersfield were struggling for rhythm and after Luke Yates was sinbinned, Leeds struck again, David Fusitu'a marking his return from injury with a try from Brodie Croft's grubber kick. Connor gave Giants a toehold in the game with a penalty late in the first half, and they spectacularly burst into life in the second. Giants focused on the right side of the Rhinos defence and Esan Marsters powered over to put a new complexion on the game, and from the restart Adam Swift raced from deep in his own half to set up a brilliant Elliot Wallis finish in the corner and level the score. Leeds responded with two quick tries of their own, Momirovski grabbing his second and then Matt Frawlrey teeing up Jarrod O'Connor to make it 24-12. Giants roared back onto the attack again, Marsters putting another big dent on the Leeds defence and Swift continuing his remarkable scoring run, with his 14th try in his past eight games. Marsters and Swift again combined brilliantly to send Harvey Livett over and Connor's quick hands created Kevin Naiqama's seventh try in as many games. Huddersfield's problem was Connor's malfunctioning boot, as he missed four consecutive conversions which meant the sides were still level - for all of Giants' attacking prowess. Leeds were rattled, though, and when Miller attempted a short kick from a goal-line drop-out he made a hash of it and from the resulting penalty Connor could not miss, right in front of the posts, and Giants finally edged ahead with six minutes remaining. Leeds raced up the other end but a shoddy passage of play gifted the ball to Clune and he sprinted clear to make sure, even though Connor missed the two points yet again. Leeds head coach Rohan Smith told BBC Radio Leeds: \"It was a very strong first half and we probably didn't make the most of it with a few more points as we were clearly the stronger team. We had six line-breaks in the first half. \"Second half we started a bit sketchy and had two outside backs injured and struggling through the first half - they started the second half but weren't able to go on. Harry (Newman) had a back spasm after getting hit hard in a tackle and (Fusitu'a) has hurt his other knee. \"I feel really bad for Fus. He's worked really hard to come back and be in good shape but is probably going to be missing for a little bit. \"We found a couple of tries to get the scoreboard back intact and that was a fair reflection of the game at that point. \"We had people playing out of position and a couple of disjointed edges. At 24-24 another huge call goes against us. When a player lends weight behind the ball carrier, that's held, but it wasn't (called), and led to a drop-out. We should have kicked it long there. \"The final try I've had a dozen people tell me Naoqama bobbled the ball.\" Huddersfield head coach Ian Watson told BBC Radio Leeds: \"Great team performance. To show the character to come back not once but twice was phenomenal. \"The boys made some nice changes in the second half to what was happening in the first half and we thoroughly deserved our win in the end. \"In terms of attack we were a little bit more direct and we got the win, which was the first (here) time in six years I believe. \"We were confident at half-time. Ash Golding spoke at half-time about how we were in a really good position and just needed a bit of tweaking to the way we were playing. \"We got back into the game and then found ourselves 12 points behind again, so the character and work-rate was outstanding.\" Leeds: Miller, Fusitu'a, Newman, Momirovski, Roberts, Croft, Frawley, Oledzki, Ackers, Sangare, McDonnell, Martin, Smith. Interchanges: O'Connor, Lisone, Goudemand, Nicholson-Watton Huddersfield: Connor, Wallis, Naiqama, Marsters, Swift, Lolohea, Clune, English, Milner, Greenwood, Cudjoe, Livett, Yates.

Bevan French opened the scoring after just seven minutes but Louis Senior intercepted a pass to run 80 metres and score for Castleford on his debut. Marshall's first try put Wigan back in front before Hampshire scored two in four minutes just after half-time. Marshall went over in the corner and wing Abbas Miski crossed, before Rowan Milnes scored a consolation for Cas.  It was a sixth Super League win of the season for Wigan, who are behind new leaders St Helens on points difference but with a game in hand, in an encounter they dominated after the break. Milnes' penalty for Cas on the stroke of half-time made it 12-8 but Warriors then stretched away. Smith's pass sent French through a hole and he passed inside for Hampshire to score his first. French then looped a pass out wide and Marshall's kick back infield found Hampshire to collect and score his second try. Farrell's flat pass to the wing sent Marshall into the corner before French grubbered to the right corner and Miski gathered to complete Wigan's night with a sixth try. Castleford could not build on their first win in the league this season, against Salford last time out. But they were at least more competitive than in the 60-6 drubbing that Wigan handed out in the Challenge Cup on Sunday.  Senior's breakaway try and Milnes' boot gave them hope at the break, but by the time Milnes gathered his own chip ahead to score their second try, the game was well gone. Wigan head coach Matt Peet told BBC Radio Manchester: \"It was alright, not great, the effort was good but we lacked a bit of cohesion. \"We showed glimpses at times of what we're capable of and came through with no injuries, so we move on. \"We're building and learning all the time and we'll keep progressing.\" Castleford head coach Craig Lingard told BBC Radio Leeds:  \"We knew the level of the task coming here and we had a couple of late changes, so we were down to the bare bones. \"We spoke all week about being competitive and wanted us to have an edge and we showed that, certainly in the first half. \"After last week we could have rolled over but we kept going all the way to the end and we'll take that into next week.\" Wigan: French, Miski, Keighran, Wardle, Marshall, Hampshire, Smith, Thompson, Leeming, Dupree, Nsemba, Farrell, Ellis.

        "text": " Rugby league is a fast and dynamic game, which involves great strength, stamina and skill, and is played through the summer, so no muddy pitches, or cold, wet training nights!  With so many variations, you don't have to play the full version of the game to be part of it.  Whatever your age, gender, fitness level or technical ability there is a version of rugby league that will suit you.  Jamie Jones-Buchanan made his Leeds Rhinos debut in 1999, and was still turning out for the club in 2016. Playing rugby league has many benefits, including keeping fit, meeting new people and maybe even progressing to a higher level.  Although rugby league shares similarities with rugby union, it is important to see them as different games, and as such, each has its own unique set of skills. Look at the rules to get a feel for the game., external Touch Rugby League is a fast, skilful and action-packed team sport, played in a fun and sociable atmosphere, without any of the tackling you see in the traditional game.  To stop the other team from scoring, you must touch the player with the ball on any part of the body or clothing.  With mixed ability, age and gender teams, touch rugby league really is all-inclusive. You can even play indoors when the weather's bad! Find out more by visiting Touch Rugby League associations in England,, externalNorthern Ireland,, externalWales, external and Scotland., external There is a new format of rugby league called X-League, which is sort of a half-way house between full contact and touch. Instead of making a touch on a player, or pulling a tag, players make a 'tackle' by touching the ball, and can make a play at an opponent by holding them to enable a touch on the ball. In reply, the ballcarrier can also fend off their opponent below the head and shoulders to avoid being tackled. Again, there is a focus on this being a social sport, and players of all ages and abilities are also encouraged. You can find out more about X-League here., external Rugby league is also played by children of primary school age (six to 11) and it focuses on making the game fun so that participants leave the pitch with a positive experience.  The concept aims to ensure that youngsters come back for more - whether that's training or games - and allows for a flexible approach, which may result in adjusting the size of the actual pitch to suit the number of players, stopping play to ensure appropriate coaching, or being flexible with the interpretation of the rules to ensure everyone gets a fair go.  In England there is a specific Primary Rugby League, external website.  Otherwise, contact your rugby league governing body in Wales, external or Scotland, external. In Northern Ireland, external they call it 'Mini Rugby League'. Aged between 12 and 18? Then you can play youth and junior rugby league.  Teams operate at every age-group between the above ages, with hundreds of leagues to compete in across Britain.  Playing at youth and junior level is a great way to get into the sport, and many participants will get into it after graduating from rugby league at a primary school age (see below for more information).  To find your local club and see what age-groups they run use the RFL's club finder, external from anywhere in the UK. Want to get into rugby league but don't fancy the full-contact version?  Tag rugby league is similar to the traditional game, but each player wears shorts with Velcro patches and two tags attached.  Attacking players attempting to dodge, evade and pass the ball while defenders attempt to prevent them scoring by \"tagging\" - pulling a velcro tag from the ball carrier.  The game can be played by anyone - boys, girls, men and women, from under 6s to over 50s, but it's very popular as an adult sport with a great social aspect.  Contact your rugby league association in Northern Ireland,, external Wales, external and Scotland, external or, in England, go to Try Tag Rugby., external The women's game is just as energetic and physically demanding as the men's version, so expect tough training sessions and even tougher matches! There are currently more than 30 community clubs that have developed female sections and an increasing number of under 16s now taking part.  Find your local club by using the Rugby Football League's (RFL) Club Locator, external or, in England, you can also visit the Women's Rugby League competition site., external Wheelchair rugby league is one of the few sports that offers both disabled and able-bodied players of both genders the chance to compete with each other on a level playing field. The game is instantly recognisable with tries, conversions and an extremely high competitive nature!  With five players on a team, tackles are made by taking the attached tag or flag and conversions are scored by punching the ball from a tee over mini-rugby posts.

        "text": " Donegal captain Ciaran Thompson was pleased to secure the Division Two title after beating Armagh 0-15 to 0-14 in the Croke Park final. Armagh fought back to lead in the second half but Donegal responded and won it thanks to a stoppage-time point from Aaron Doherty.  \"We were in good shape with 10-15 minutes to go but Armagh are always going to fight back,\" said Thompson. \"We showed good character to get two points at the end to win it by one.\" Donegal defeat Armagh to win Division Two decider Both teams had already earned promotion to Division One before a tight all-Ulster showdown in Dublin was won by a Donegal side rejuvenated under manager Jim McGuinness. \"That was main challenge of the year - to get out of Division Two, to get promoted and we've achieved that,\" Thompson told TG4. \"Anytime you get to play at Croke Park for a national title it's always nice to win so it's another tick in the book.  \"The whole set-up with Jim and the backroom staff has been really top class. I think everyone has bought in, it's just so positive to work under him and work under the coaches.\" Colm McFadden is one of those coaches and he looked ahead to an Ulster SFC opener against holders Derry, who won the Division One title on Sunday.  \"We knew Armagh were always going to be a tough test - they always come back and showed that in the second half,\" he said. \"To come through the game without any injuries and with every player still fit is important for us. \"It's nice to win and to get some silverware. I hope it sets us up for the championship - it's three weeks to the Derry game and that's our focus now.\""

        "text": " Darren Gleeson has appealed to Antrim hurling fans to get behind his team again after what he described at a noticeable fall off in support amid the county's League struggles this year. Antrim's Division One campaign ended with a fifth straight defeat as Tipperary won 2-21 to 0-12 in Belfast. The Saffrons were again without a host of players but Gleeson was also concerned by the stay away supporters. \"It's time for people to get back with their feet,\" insisted the Antrim boss. \"You need to get back in behind it for these big games [coming up in the Leinster Championship]. \"We have Wexford coming here, you [also] have Carlow and Galway which are all massive matches and get down the road to support us on 21 April against Kilkenny.  \"Antrim against Kilkenny, there's a huge opportunity for us to play against last year's All-Ireland Finalists. So we need the support in behind us as well. I just felt that was missing through the league campaign.  \"The players and everyone stuck with it but the support disappeared.\" This season's League campaign was always going to be tough for the Saffrons with talisman Neil McManus having returned from the inter-county game and several players, including Dunloy quartet Eoin O'Neill, Ryan Elliott, Seaan Elliott and Keelan Molloy opting out for 2024, along with Domhnall Nugent and Joe Maskey.  To make matters worse, Gleeson has had more than a dozen members of his squad on the treatment table and unavailable during stages of the League. Despite being understrength themselves, Tipperary were always in control at Corrigan Park as they led led 1-10 to 0-4 before going to complete a 15-point victory to secure their place in the League semi-finals. Gleeson said he couldn't fault his team's effort on Saturday. \"They were trying hard. Tipperary were just a step above us quality wise.  \"It was probably level enough possession wise and they we got to a certain section of the field and we were closed up and didn't execute the basics.  \"You can have lots of excuses, the rain and stuff like that and terrible conditions. What can I take out of it? There are guys there trying their best.  \"You just have to bring it back to the training field on Monday night and build on it come championship.  \"We've 35 or 36 days to get bodies right, get the players on the field and have a good go at the Leinster Senior Hurling.\" Gleeson does believe Antrim will be considerably more competitive if they are able to get their injured players back on the field.  \"The group know where we're at when you're on the training field with 18 to 20 players because you've 12 to 14 guys inside in the gym rehabbing.  \"We're also trying to integrate some new players into the squad coming from straight club experience. The young guy in goals today Cormac McFadden hasn't played a club championship match and he played a National League match for the county today.  \"You have to give those guys the space to breathe and to learn and develop and in fairness to them, they are.  \"I can see the progress on the field. It just hasn't transcended into the National Hurling League yet.  \"We know what's ahead of us and I think if we get our bodies on the field, we'll have a right cut at some of the matches there.\""

        "text": " Tyrone squeezed into an Ulster Football semi-final meeting with Donegal next Sunday after a tense 1-23 to 3-16 extra-time win over a brave Cavan side. The Red Hands appeared in control as they led 1-16 to 1-8 after 53 minutes. But Cavan punished Padraig Hampsey's black card by hitting 2-1 as Padraig Faulkner and Niall Carolan netted which helped the home side force extra-time. Tyrone hit only three points in extra-time but it proved enough as Cavan were unable to bring the game to penalties. Cavan 3-16 Tyrone 1-23 - the action as it happened Cian Madden's goal gave Cavan an early 1-1 to 0-2 lead but Brian Kennedy's exchange of passes with Darren McCurry set up debutant Liam Gray to net for the Red Hands in the 18th minute and they pushed on to extend their advantage to 1-10 to 1-4 by half-time.  Tyrone seemed under no threat as they extended their lead to eight midway through the second half but the Red Hands badly lost their way as Cavan suddenly upped the pace. As bodies noticeably tired, scores proved at a premium in extra time but the Red Hands, despite losing key forwards Darragh Canavan and Darren McCurry to injury which will be a worry for next week, did enough to set up next Sunday's meeting at Celtic Park with Derry's conquerors. Jim McGuinness was at Breffni Park to watch the action and can't have been upset to see the attrition and energy expended by the Red Hands as they finally saw off the home side. Granted, compared to the Saturday's remarkable contest at Celtic Park, the action was ponderous over the opening 53 minutes in Cavan town as Tyrone controlled the proceedings - largely thanks to the efforts of Canavan, Brian Kennedy, Michael McKernan and Hampsey, who dominated his duel with Cavan dangerman Paddy Lynch in the opening half. Cavan did lead twice early on with Cian Madden hitting the opening score before Oisin Brady's pass set him up to lash past Niall Morgan in the ninth minute. But a McKernan point - his second after a typical foray upfield - started an unanswered run of 1-3 for the Red Hands which was finished off by debutant Gray's goal. Cavan cut Tyrone's advantage to three by the 27th minute, after the first of corner-back Brian O'Connell's two points but two successive Darragh Canavan efforts from play and a Ciaran Daly score put the Red Hands six up at the break. McKernan's third score immediately after the restart extended Tyrone's advantage and while Lynch finally escaped Hampsey's shackles to get off the mark, there was no hint of the drama that was to follow as unanswered points from Ruairi Canavan, goalkeeper Morgan and McCurry made it 1-16 to 1-8 by the 52nd minute. However Hampsey had been black carded four minutes earlier following an off-the-ball exchange with Lynch and Cavan were able to exploit their extra man during his absence as Faulkner's 53rd-minute goal after he had set up by Conor Brady, gave Cavan a lifeline. An Oisin Brady point was then followed by Carolan's 58th-minute goal as he hammered to the roof of the net by picking up possession following Morgan's attempt to punch clear a floated fisted ball from Lynch. Amazingly, there was now only a point as Tyrone led 1-16 to 3-9 and after Faulkner missed a Cavan point-scoring chance, the excellent Oisin Brady's third point did get the Breffni men on terms in the 63rd minute. Tyrone moved two ahead twice during the remainder of normal time but Cavan refused to relent as a Lynch free and O'Connell's fisted effort, when potentially a goal looked on, ensured extra time. As both sides were forced to make wholesale changes amid the attrition, extra time produced only five scores as Canavan's seventh point and a Niall Devlin score put them two up before a Tiarnan Madden effort left the minimum between the sides after the opening 10-minute period.  Following the withdrawals of McCurry and Canavan, substitute Tiernan Quinn took the free-taking duties to kick what ultimately proved Tyrone's winning point after Cavan keeper Gary O'Rourke had been blown up for over-carrying.  Paddy Lynch's free was the final score of the game but they were unable to work the ball into a scoring position in the closing seconds despite having possession as David Coldrick blew the final whistle.

        "text": " Armagh's Conor Turbitt says that Armagh's fast start to the game was crucial in his side's Ulster Championship quarter-final win against Fermanagh.  Turbitt, Jarly Og Burns and Stefan Campbell all found the net inside the opening 35 minutes at Brewster Park as Armagh won 3-11 to 0-9. The Orchard County will now face Down in the semi-final in a fortnight's time. \"The goals were massive,\" Turbitt said. \"We made a point between ourselves of coming out hard at the start of the game and that's what we did, scoring the three goals. \"Historically, we haven't got much coming here, so that was something which we emphasised,\" he explained. \"It is something which we have worked on - following your pass and trying to get in behind teams, because that's what leads to goals.\" Whilst Armagh have had many tough battles against Fermanagh at Brewster Park over the years, they were 3-4 to 0-2 to the good at the interval on Sunday. In the second half, Fermanagh didn't allow Armagh to run up the score and kept things much closer, but the damage was done. For Turbitt and the Orchard County, it was just a case of seeing the win over the line, playing against a strong breeze. \"The second half was just about seeing it out in tough conditions,\" he admitted. \"It was about consolidating what we had, whilst also trying to chip over a few points.  \"We probably think that we could have got more, but in the end there was a fair enough gap between us and we just saw it out. A win is a win.\" Up next, Armagh take on local rivals Down in the last four, and Turbitt says that it is one for the fans to be excited for. \"You always look forward to games against Down,\" said the Clann Eireann man. \"We'll look forward to it, but they'll be looking forward to it. We'll give it our best and see how it goes.\""

        "description": "Charlie Smyth's head was all over the place.",
        "text": " Charlie Smyth's head was all over the place. This was his big opportunity and the wait to find out if his dream had been realised or shattered was proving torturous. Life has moved really fast for Smyth over the past year. Hailing from the village of Mayobridge, Smyth was at one stage training to be a teacher and playing a bit of Gaelic football, the sport he has played all his life. But after deciding to pursue his dream of becoming an American footballer, Smyth found himself in New Orleans, 4,000 miles away from home and facing up to the biggest day of his young life. Having honed his skills as a kicker, 22-year-old Smyth did enough at the NFL Combine and International Player Pathway Pro Day to make the New Orleans Saints sit up and take notice. Smyth was invited to train with the Saints and showcase his kicking skills at the Saints' training facility under the watchful eye of head coach Dennis Allen among others. He kicked well. He missed a few, but nailed one from 61 yards and was generally happy enough with how he performed under pressure. After he was done kicking, he was told to grab a shower. \"I was thinking 'what's going to happen here?' - my head was absolutely scrambled,\" Smyth told The GAA Social. \"I didn't know what was happening, I was like 'am I getting a contract or not here?' because they talked about working with me in the future.\" Listen to Charlie Smyth on The GAA Social  'Real work starts now' - Smyth on Saints deal After a quick scrub, Smyth was told he was going to be taken upstairs. A good sign, he thought. He was right. Upstairs, he met the general manager Mickey Loomis and was offered a three-year contract. After going through the terms with his agent, Smyth signed and his life would never be the same again. Smyth hadn't kicked an American football before last August. Now he has a genuine shot at playing in the NFL. The last couple of weeks have been, by his own admission, \"absolutely insane\". \"It's just been unbelievable. The phone has been hopping with just the support from everyone back home has been unbelievable. \"I just feel very lucky and grateful.\" Lucky indeed. If Smyth makes the Saints' active roster, he could earn around $800,000 (\u00c2\u00a3630,680) a year. But coming from a GAA background, he's not one for getting bogged down in the big sums. Smyth knows that he's entered a cut-throat world, an environment in which his position is far from invulnerable. \"They can cut you anytime [from your contract],\" he explains. \"If you're on the practice squad, it's obviously different to what you'd be earning on the active roster. \"It's probably about four times that amount. For me, I know I'm talking about money here, but for me it really has nothing to do with that. \"Genuinely it's not, I've been a huge fan of the sport from about seven or eight years ago. For me it's all about making the best version of myself.\" Smyth, who revealed he was previously a Green Bay Packers fan, added: \"At the minute, I know it might sound all serious and all, but I do have a really tough job ahead of me. I feel like I've got the confidence that I can do it.\" For a young man who once excitedly slid into the DMs of the NFL UK's Instagram page asking how he could become an American footballer, Smyth seems like he has his head screwed on. He knows the road that lies ahead and the work that's required if he is to dislodge Blake Grupe - who he is yet to meet - as the Saints' kicker for the 2024 NFL season. \"I've been a huge fan of the NFL. I would watch it more than Gaelic football, to be honest, and soccer as well, and it's not really normal to follow it back home,\" Smyth said. \"It's maybe not something that motivates me but we probably are putting Gaelic football on the map. The number of people I've spoken to in the States who are like 'what's this Gaelic soccer, or football?'. We're creating awareness for it.\" The key question, of course, is: is Smyth good enough to make it? \"I feel like I am. I have a few adjustments to make but I definitely have the leg, the height on my kicks and the power and I feel like there's a few kickers who don't have that. \"If I can keep developing and taking on the tips from the coaches, I feel like I can be in the better half of the kickers in the league. The standard is so high, it's unbelievable.\""

        "text": " Oisin McConville praised Niall Devlin's \"mental fortitude\" in starring in Tyrone's win over Monaghan a week after the funeral of his brother Caolan who tragically died in a road accident.  Tyrone's victory meant the Red Hands preserved their Division One status as Monaghan were relegated. McConville told The GAA Social that Devlin's display was only bettered by man of the match Darragh Canavan. \"It looked as if it was very important for him to play,\" added McConville. \"It's the right thing when a player wants to play. A lot of times you're putting your hand up because you feel you must or you have to. \"But as far as the grieving process is concerned, I do feel Niall and the family will get a lot out of that.  \"I thought he was one of the best players on the field. Only for a masterclass from Darragh Canavan, I thought he was next in line for man of the match, he was that good.  \"To have the mental fortitude and resilience and the bravery to put yourself forward in a situation like that, he deserves nothing but credit,\" added McConville. \"And we moan about gaelic football sometimes and the quality of it and the strains of people enjoying it and that sort of thing but it's amazing at times like this what it can do for you and the way the GAA community can rally round after a tragedy like that.  \"There is no sport that does that better.\" Tyrone's victory in a game that McConville said had had \"unbelievable quality\" despite the wet conditions in Omagh meant Monaghan dropped to Division Two for the first time since 2014 but the 2002 Armagh All-Ireland winner believes the Farney County will be able to take positives from the contest. \"I saw enough from Monaghan the other night to think that they'll still be OK and that there will no team taking them for granted through the summer.  \"It was [also] Conor McManus' first start of the league. He still has it judging by that point he kicked in the second half off his left foot with no backlift - yeah\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\u00e2\u0080\u00a6he's still going to be knocking about too.\" At the top of Division One, Derry remain on course for a place in the League Final after they overcame Mayo 3-15 to 2-13 in an exciting game at Castlebar. Shane McGuigan tallied 1-4 in the first half alone and went on to add two further points in another man-of-the-match display which included making a vital late block in his own defence. \"He's covering some ground at the minute and still has the ability to get up top and get the crucial scores,\" added McConville.  \"He seems to make the right decision all of the time and he obviously is a deadly finisher.\" Derry will be guarantee a league final place if they avoid defeat against relegation-threatened Roscommon at Celtic Park next weekend and McConville says playing in the Division One decider will be the perfect tune-up for their Ulster Championship contest against Donegal three weeks later. \"For anybody to say, 'we don't want to be in a league final\u00e2\u0080\u00a6.we don't want to win the league'\u00e2\u0080\u00a6.I can't compute that stuff. That would just fry my head,\" continued McConville. \"This idea that somehow it hampers your progress down the line is absolute nonsense.\" McConville's own Wicklow team will be involved in one of several relegation contests next weekend when they take on Antrim in Belfast. An Antrim victory will save the Saffrons from the drop to Division Four - relegating Wicklow in the process - while if the Garden County win at Corrigan Park, the Saffrons will be relegated should Offaly also beat Limerick in Tullamore. At the top of the table in Division Three, Down's draw with Westmeath in Mullingar on Sunday means the Mournemen must avoid defeat at home to Clare next Sunday to be certain of earning promotion, with the Bannermen going up if they win at Pairc Esler and Westmeath, in turn, taking the other spot if they win or draw in Sligo. \"Having played both teams I think that will be a cracker of a game,\" added McConville of the Newry game.  \"I don't think there will be a big pile between those two teams.\" McConville was hugely impressed by his native Armagh's display in clinching promotion alongside Donegal as they ruthlessly ended Cavan's hopes of ascent to Division One by earning a 2-21 to 0-12 win at the Athletic Grounds. \"Armagh have been very impressive. They struggled in the Louth game but since that they've been one of the most impressive teams in the country.\" At the bottom of Division Two, Fermanagh slipped into the relegation places as Louth put six goals past them at Ardee. \"Anybody that's watched Louth this year will maybe feel that they were owed something because they have been really, really unlucky in a couple of games. Sometimes you run into something like that,\" added McConville's of Fermanagh's hammering. A Fermanagh win over Cavan will not be enough to save them if Louth avoid defeat against already-relegated Kildare in Carlow. \"I don't think Saturday was a fair reflection of how good Fermanagh have been all year but definitely confidence will not be in a great place after that result,\" said McConville."

        "text": " Ryan McHugh says Saturday's thrilling Ulster Championship win over holders Derry means \"everything\" to Donegal.  Having won the Division One title, back-to-back champions Derry came into the Celtic Park contest at hot favourites.  But Jim McGuinness' side hit four goals in a sun-drenched classic as Donegal sent a major statement of intent.  \"There's an old cliche in sport, nobody really give us a chance, but we fully believed,\" McHugh told BBC Sport NI.  \"We knew we had a lot of good players in Donegal. It was a matter of us going out and putting in our best performance. We knew we'd need our best performance. I think we got that today.  \"It's huge for the county and the people of Donegal. We're delighted. We're in a very privileged position. We get the opportunity to put the smiles on the faces of Donegal people and hopefully we did that today.\" When asked if Donegal really believed they had been written off prior to Saturday's game, McHugh said: \"You hear outside noise and people talking and rightly so. Listen, Derry have been the best team in Ireland this year so far.  \"They fully deserve to be on the pedestal where they are and they're not going to go away overnight. They're a top team and they're still going to have a huge say in the All-Ireland series.\" Having made his championship debut in 2013 during McGuinness' first spell as boss, McHugh is one of the longest-serving players in the Donegal panel.  Kilcar man McHugh stepped away from the inter-county scene last year and watched on as Donegal endured a turbulent year before McGuinness' return.  But on Saturday, having enjoyed quiet 30th birthday celebrations earlier this week, the two-time All-Star looked back to his livewire best, scoring two points and constantly pushing Donegal up the pitch with relentless hard running.  Hailing McGuinness' influence, McHugh said: \"Last year was well-documented. It was disappointing for everyone in Donegal. Jim to be fair to him deserves a lot of credit. He didn't have to come back.  \"Jim has nothing to prove to the people of Ireland or Donegal. He's put his neck on the line by coming back and we'll forever be grateful for him and what he's done. He's put us back into a position where we can compete with the best teams in Ireland.\"  Saturday's game was played out in front of an enraptured sell-out crowd at a sun-soaked Celtic Park. After a flat start to the Ulster series, it felt like the shot in the arm this year's championship needed.  \"I think it is,\" McHugh said when asked if this was the Ulster Championship at its best.  \"It's really fresh and I'll have to watch the game back tomorrow. When you're in the middle of it it's hard to take in everything but I think it's the Ulster Championship at it best.  \"Two teams really going for it, trying to get over the line and thankfully we've done that today.\""

        "text": " Antrim manager Darren Gleeson described the difference between his team and Kilkenny as \"worlds apart\" after the Cats romped to a 5-30 to 0-13 win at Nowlan Park on Sunday. In this Leinster Hurling Championship opener, there was nothing by the way of positives for the Ulster men who were well off the pace required in this environment  and, while the hosts were really in the mood, at times it was all too easy for them. Antrim were rank outsiders to even get close to causing an upset prior to throw-in, but that didn't change the fact they were simply poor on the day, out-hustled, out-muscled, and ultimately destroyed on the scoreboard. The level of performance was a long way off what was required and, indeed expected, as the Antrim boss had little to offer in terms of reasons why his charges were so flat. \"Kilkenny's execution was unbelievable,\" said Gleeson. \"We were exposed in a lot of areas, but most worrying is that they out-worked us. From the very first minute we should be a hungry team, but that lack of desire and work would really disappoint you. \"There are going to be ups and downs in the game but it was literally floodgates open once that score went in. We gave up really early in the game. The work-rate wasn't there, the endeavour wasn't there, and simple tasks we didn't carry out how we'd like to.\"  Although it was hard to make a case for anything other than a Kilkenny win in the build-up, Antrim's minimum requirement was to deliver a performance and a platform to build upon for the rest of the competition. They didn't get anywhere close to that and the 32-point loss could have been worse had the Noresiders cleaned up their shooting with 17 shots going the wrong side of the posts. With Wexford arriving in Corrigan Park on Saturday for their second fixture, it's a case of hitting there reset button for Antrim as they look to deliver what they are capable of. Earning the right to play had always been a key feature of Gleeson's tenure and he was disappointed his team didn't do that on Sunday. They have aspirations to challenge the top teams, but the Tipperary native admitted that is a long way off when Sunday's display is factored in as they seemed to have accepted their fate from an early stage. \"There wasn't much expected of us coming here today, but you'd expect a bit of fight and determination - that was the most disappointing aspect,\" he added. \"We were tiers below. They (Kilkenny) will be disappointed with aspects of their game but there was no comparison between the two teams there.\""

        "text": " With the breathless nature of the inter-county season these days, we find ourselves on the cusp of another Ulster Championship just days after an enthralling conclusion to the National League.  The Ulster Championship is perennially regarded as the most fiercely competitive provincial competition. This year should - for the most part - be no different.  From Mickey Harte attempting to lead Derry to a hat-trick of Ulster titles to Jim McGuinness overseeing Donegal in championship action for the first time since 2014, there are plenty of sub-plots to ensure a gripping road to the final on 12 May.  Here, BBC Sport looks at everything you need to know about the 2024 Ulster SFC.  Football and hurling championship fixtures The championship begins on Sunday with the preliminary round contest between Monaghan and Cavan at St Tiernach's Park, Clones.  Then it's into the quarter-finals. On Saturday, 13 April, Down take on Antrim in Newry before Fermanagh host Armagh in Enniskillen the following day. On 20 April, Derry face Donegal at Celtic Park in a hotly-anticipated clash that pits Harte and McGuinness against one another in the championship for the first time since 2013. On 21 April, Tyrone host the winners of this weekend's Monaghan v Cavan game.  The semi-finals will take place on the weekend of 27/28 April with the final on 12 May. You can watch seven Ulster Championship matches live on the BBC this year. Every BBC match will be available to watch on BBC Two Northern Ireland, the BBC iPlayer and the BBC Sport website, The BBC Sport website will also have live text commentaries, as well as reports, highlights, analysis, reaction and in-play clips, while you can also stay up to date across the BBC Sport NI social media accounts. For Sunday's opener between Monaghan and Cavan at Clones, there will be expert insight and analysis from Donegal legend Michael Murphy, Dublin great Philly McMahon, former Monaghan star Paul Finlay, recently-retired Monaghan stalwart Kieran Hughes and former Cavan forward Seanie Johnston. Sarah Mulkerrins will present the programme, with Thomas Niblock on commentary and Mark Sidebottom providing pitchside updates. In 2023, Derry beat Fermanagh, Monaghan and Armagh to successfully defend the Anglo-Celt Cup.  The final was an unforgettable occasion with the Oak Leafers beating the Orchard men 3-1 on penalties after a captivating game ended 1-15 to 0-18 after extra-time.  Derry are heavily fancied to retain their Ulster crown and become the first team since Armagh in 2006 to complete a hat-trick of wins in the competition.  After last year's triumph over Armagh, Derry reached the All-Ireland semi-finals under Ciaran Meenagh. But having fallen to Galway in 2022, they were edged out by Kerry.  Now, buoyed by winning a first National League title since 2008 and with three-time All-Ireland winner Harte at the helm, Derry are determined to go even further as they bid to end a 31-year wait to get their hands back on the Sam Maguire.  While Armagh lost last weekend's Division Two final to Donegal, Kieran McGeeney's men will be back in the final if they beat Fermanagh in the quarter-final and either Down or Antrim in the semi-final.  Donegal also cannot be discounted. After an unbeaten league campaign, McGuinness will face his biggest test since returning to the Donegal hotseat when his side travel up to Celtic Park.  Tyrone and Monaghan have often saved their best stuff for the championship over the years. Tyrone had a mixed Division One campaign, but then again, in 2021 they signed off their league campaign with a crushing six-goal defeat by Kerry, but still went on to win Ulster and All-Ireland titles.  And while Monaghan are coming off relegation from Division One, they were All-Ireland semi-finalists last year, so underestimating Vinny Corey's side would be perilous, especially if Rory Beggan returns.  The Ulster Championship finalists are guaranteed a spot in the All-Ireland round-robin stages.  The 16 teams in the All-Ireland group stages are made up of:  The four provincial champions The four beaten provincial finalists The 2023 Tailteann Cup winners (Meath) The seven next-ranked teams based on their final position in the 2024 Allianz League As it stands currently, Derry, Tyrone and Donegal are the Ulster teams guaranteed a spot in the All-Ireland group stages.  After the All-Ireland round-robin phase, there will be preliminary quarter-finals, quarter-finals and semi-finals before the Croke Park showpiece on 28 July. "

        "text": " Armagh footballer Aimee Mackin says Gaelic Games' three wings must remain steadfast in their plan to amalgamate in 2027 in the face of any practical difficulties that may crop up. Mackin told The GAA Social that she is very much in favour of the integration plan unveiled last month. However, she did admit her concern that the amalgamation could potentially be derailed by \"negativity\". \"I want people to stick with the process,\" added Mackin. The GAA Social - The curse of county Mayo \"It's not [all] going to go swimmingly. They are going to be things that people aren't going to agree with but I think stick with it and see where it gets to.  \"I've heard negative things about it and positive things about it. My attitude is think of the positives. Think it's going to work.   \"There are going to be a lot of hard discussions probably that have to be had. The right people are probably in the roles to do that,\" continued the 2020 Ladies Gaelic Football Players' Player of the Year. The Shane O'Neill's clubwoman is confident the Ladies Gaelic Football Association won't be \"swallowed up\" as a result of the integration process.  Some ladies football voices do have misgivings about the planned amalgamation, pointing our the astonishing rise of the sport in recent times under the leadership of the LGFA. However, Mackin feels that the unity of the GAA, the LGFA and the Camogie Association will formalise something that is already a reality at club level. \"It's still going to be ladies football. When I was growing up, it was always 'the GAA'. The GAA has always been the heading and you have four codes under that. For me in my head, it's not really a big difference.\" The 26-year-old, who has been capped for the Northern Ireland football team in addition to playing for AFL club Melbourne along with her sister Blaithin, admits that playing conditions for ladies inter-county footballers - certainly in the case of Armagh - have improved considered since she joined the squad as an 18-year-old. \"I remember the first few years, you would maybe find out about five o'clock [in the evening] that 'we're training in Lurgan now'.  \"At the time, I was 18, 19\u00e2\u0080\u00a6.loving life playing football so I didn't really think too much about it. If it was happening now, I'd be like, 'right we need to get out act together'. I would be a bit grumpier.\" Thankfully it's now a very different situation with the county's ladies board having opened it own training facility in Killean in south Armagh a couple of years ago, thanks largely to the efforts of their chairperson Sinead Reel, which was a first in ladies gaelic football. \"It's been brilliant for us having Killean. Just having that stability is big for us,\" added Mackin. \"You can go up early if you want and go and have a kickabout. You don't have to text somebody to open doors. It just feels like your own club ground.\" That stability may have proved a part in Armagh finally achieving promotion to Division One last year and they have made a sensational start in the top-flight over the past six weeks by winning their five opening games, which has included their most recent wins over Meath and Kerry. With Waterford, Cork and Galway also having accounted for, the Orchard woman currently have a five-point lead over Kerry at the top of the table, in a competition where a win earns three points. \"So far so good. We're only in March so it's early days yet. We'll enjoy it because we haven't been in Division One long enough to not enjoy these moments.\" Given their fast start to 2024, inevitably there have been suggestions that Greg McGonigle's side will be genuine All-Ireland contenders later this year. Mackin is reluctant to get drawn into such conversations. Asked whether Armagh are good enough to win this year's All-Ireland, Mackin, after a long pause, replies: \"I'd say yes but there are a lot of experienced other counties that have been there longer than us so we have to build our own little experiences. \"There are a lot of teams there that are very good. Dublin, Kerry, Meath\u00e2\u0080\u00a6so there are always big challenges and I think in the ladies game at the minute, there are seven or eight teams that can win it which makes it difficult.  \"We're there or thereabouts but we probably still have to develop a bit more in terms of our age range. \"There are a couple of us in and around 26, 27 and then the 18, 19-year-olds coming in so it's just about developing them and being the team we want to be and developing the system we want to play,\" added Mackin, who sees herself continuing to play for Armagh until \"in and around 31, 32\"."

        "text": " Mattie Donnelly says Tyrone's laboured extra-time win over Cavan means it will be 'advantage Donegal' in next Sunday's Ulster semi-final at Celtic Park.  Donnelly admitted his initial feeling was relief after Tyrone staggered though beating Cavan by 1-23 to 3-16. However he claimed a repeat performance next week against Jim McGuinness' high-flying Donegal will only end one way. \"Anyone who watched Donegal knows if we perform like that again, we may as well not bother showing up,\" said Donnelly. \"The bits I saw you couldn't but be impressed with them. \"They're a team with a plan, a team with serious running power and serious threats all over. \"We are going to have to come up with something to counteract that.\" Tyrone need extra-time to battle past Cavan Tyrone will play Donegal in Celtic Park next Sunday, with Down facing Armagh in the first Ulster semi-final on Saturday night. Taking on Donegal, who stormed past Derry in impressive fashion 24 hours earlier, already looked a daunting task for either Cavan or Tyrone given the winner would have just seven days to prepare. Yet Tyrone made life even harder for themselves by squandering an eight-point lead in the final quarter of normal time following a momentum-changing black card for Padraig Hampsey. That led to a further 20 minutes of extra time for already tired and sore bodies. \"I know, I know.... it's advantage Donegal in that regard,\" said Donnelly. \"Obviously they will be feeling good about themselves after last night, and with having an extra 24 hours recovery, so advantage them. \"Look, we train hard enough to deal with things like that so we'll not complain but we have to turn things around and get recovered pretty quickly.\" Donnelly, on his return to the team after suffering a serious knee injury while playing for his club Trillick last summer, played every single minute against Cavan. He was almost the last man standing as others fell by the wayside with cramp and alongside experienced heads like Hampsey and Niall Morgan, had to steer a young side through a chaotic game. \"The initial feeling I suppose after getting through is bittersweet - relieved but not very happy. \"Not happy with how we did individually or as a collective. We've a lot to do. \"The black card, we didn't deal well with it. Paudie Hampsey is a big player and a steadying influence and hard to replace. \"We didn't deal well with the change in momentum. We looked very vulnerable once he went off the pitch. \"Once they hit us with those two goals, look momentum is a hard thing to fight against when you have that much momentum going against you. \"But it's a young team and we're learning.\""

        "text": " Down football manager Conor Laverty has confirmed that he is \"exploring\" the option of using former All-Star and current county coach Martin Clarke as a goalkeeper for the squad. Laverty said that the 2010 All-Star forward, who is now 36, has played a couple of recent challenge games. \"Marty has been training with us all year and he's been brilliant,\" Laverty told BBC Sport Northern Ireland.  \"His experience and voice is phenomenal back there.\" Laverty was at pains to emphasise that John O'Hare has established himself as Down's number one this year following Niall Kane's decision to opt out of the squad and with Charlie Smyth pursuing his American Football ambitions in recent months.  \"John has been super throughout the league. We're exploring it [the Clarke goalkeeper option] and that's as far as it goes. John has got the number one spot and he's holding on to it very, very well,\" said Laverty, speaking after Sunday's 3-15 to 1-10 win over Clare, which clinched the Mourne County's promotion to Division Two of the Allianz Football League. Clarke had a hugely successful Australian Football Rules career in addition to starring for Down but was forced to retire from football in 2017 because of Addison's Disease, a condition which causes extreme fatigue and weight loss. However, he has been playing in goals for his club An Riocht in recent times and says he is enjoying training alongside O'Hare and Kevin Anderson, under the watchful eye of Down's goalkeeping coach, former Tyrone custodian John Devine. \"Am I training with the group? I am,\" Clarke told BBC Sport NI.  \"I'm doing a bit of coaching in the drills and things like that but I'm very much down the pecking order at the minute in terms of coming into play in that role.  \"We've an excellent goalkeeper in John O'Hare. He hasn't missed a minute for us all year including the McKenna Cup and he was very solid again for us today and I'm delighted for him because he's a fantastic fellow first and foremost. And he's starting to grow into that role.  \"Kevy Anderson is in there as well, and old mate that I played with in 2010, 2011 when I played for Down.  \"We know Niall Kane moved on. Charlie Smyth is in America. There are a couple of other goalkeepers who decided not to come on board this year so for me at the minute, it's probably a good bit away in terms of me back playing. \"I'm in as a coach number one. God forbid if anything happened to our current goalkeepers. I'm in behind there.  \"I'll just continue to support what's there and keep myself fit and keep working away with John Devine the goalkeeping coach.\" Down's impressive win over Clare sets up a Division Three Final meeting with Westmeath at Croke Park next Saturday, with the likely prize a place in this year's Sam Maguire Cup, as opposed to having their summer in the second-tier Tailteann Cup where the Mournemen lost last year's final against Meath. \"There was a pressure on this game after last weekend but I felt that there was a massive response from our players,\" said Laverty of Sunday's display. \"There are still a lot of permutations for that Sam Maguire [spot].  \"The goal at the start of the year was to get out of Division Two and get to a better standard of football and that's what this Down team want to be playing week in, week out.\"  Down drew with Westmeath in Mullingar last weekend and while the Lake County lost in Sligo on Sunday, Clarke says the Division Three decider will represent a \"massive game\" for the Mourne County.  \"We spoke to the boys in the changing rooms that the preparation switches to that straight away and the job isn't done because the prize of the league title is big this year in terms of putting yourself on the front foot in terms of the Sam Maguire competition.\""

        "text": " Jim McGuinness further enhanced his reputation as one of the greatest managers in the modern era by leading Donegal to a stunning 4-11 to 0-17 triumph over Derry in Celtic Park. Donegal powered home with three second-half goals to end Derry's attempt to win three Ulster titles in a row. Daire O'Baoill chipped Odhran Lynch twice before Oisin Gallen and Jamie Brennan goals sealed a memorable win. Donegal will play Tyrone or Cavan in the Ulster semi-final next Sunday. Derry have a month to regroup for the All-Ireland series after McGuinness inflicted another horrible d\u00c3\u00a9j\u00c3\u00a0 vu moment on Derry manager Mickey Harte, who is yet to beat the Donegal maestro in championship football. McGuinness defeated Harte's Tyrone team in the Ulster Championship three years in a row from 2011 to 2013 - but his new Donegal team were not expected to be ready to topple a seasoned, well-established Derry side in year one of his second stint in charge. Four-goal Donegal stun Ulster holders Derry - as it happened McGuinness' return to the Donegal sideline for the first time in 10 years, allied to Tyrone legend Harte's surprise appointment as Derry boss this year, meant that their collision in this Ulster Championship first round clash was always going to be a fascinating prospect. And the game itself did not disappoint. A high-octane, high-quality encounter was bossed mostly by the Division Two champions who dropped very deep, broke at speed and were still able to mark the Division One champions' best players out of the game. Conor Glass and Shane McGuigan, so often key men during Derry's marvellous run over the last few years, were peripheral figures and there was no Plan B as Donegal streaked clear. Ryan McHugh, Caolan McGonagle, Jason McGee and Daire O Baoill produced masterful performances for Donegal, who have blown the Ulster Championship wide open by taking out the hot favourites. Daire O'Baoill lobbed a stranded Derry goalkeeper Odhran Lynch twice, once in each half before Oisin Gallen dispatched a penalty after Chrissy McKaigue fouled Shane O'Donnell to move Donegal an incredible seven points up, 3-8 to 0-10. With the joyous Donegal fans scarcely believing their eyes, Jamie Brennan completed the rout blasting the ball high into the net to finish off yet another Donegal counterattack. Donegal had turned a narrow 1-7 to 0-9 interval lead into an impressive six-point victory that will live long in the memory of the 14,714 packed inside Celtic Park. The game started as most Derry games have started this year, with the Oak Leafers dictating the terms and having things their own way. Ethan Doherty scored the first of three first-half points in the second minute and after an impressive period of keep-ball by the Division One league champions, Paul Cassidy finished the remarkable passage of play with a second Derry point. Already it looked like Donegal were chasing shadows, but from the moment Caolan McGonagle broke through and had a goal-bound shot saved by Odhran Lynch, the game caught fire. Suddenly Donegal started with playing with purpose, confidence and belief and in a glorious eight-minute spell they hit 1-4 without reply. Central to it all was Ryan McHugh who picked his moments and broke with speed, scorching through the lines and kicking a point from play off either foot. He had a major hand in O Baoill's goal too, pouncing on a loose ball batted down by a Derry kickout and slipping it to O Baoill who had the vision and accuracy to chip the stranded Lynch. It put Donegal 1-4 to 0-3 ahead after 19 minutes and Derry, so unused to the position of having to chase games, reacted with two substitutions bringing on Gareth McKinless and Niall Toner.  The 15 minutes before half time was finely balanced with the teams trading points and it was anticipated Derry would come out with a new sense of direction and impose themselves on the game. Instead, it was Donegal who picked up where they left off. Lightning struck twice when O Baoill lobbed Lynch for a second time, the sweeper keeper clearly undeterred by the concession of the opening goal. McHugh was again involved in the move that led to Gallen's penalty with a lovely floated ball over the top to O Baoill. After Donegal were temporarily reduced to 14 players with Niall O'Donnell's black card, Derry had a good spell with points from Lachlan Murray and Shane McGuigan, but Brennan's goal on the break after 64 minutes sealed it. While no-one saw Donegal capable of producing a performance of this intensity, and sustaining it for a whole game, Derry will have plenty to ponder after a damaging defeat but will undoubtedly still have a big say in the All-Ireland series once the dust settles on an unforgettable evening in Celtic Park."

        "text": " Tyrone joint-manager Brian Dooher picked out Darragh Canavan for praise as the Red Hands prepared for Sunday's Ulster SFC quarter-final against Cavan.  The Errigal Ciaran forward impressed as Tyrone maintained their Division One status and will now hope to take that form into the Breffni Park game. \"Darragh had a phenomenal league campaign and was pivotal to the wins that we got,\" said Dooher.  \"It's not only his attacking play - his work rate is an example to everyone.\"  Cavan defeat Monaghan in Ulster SFC opener Tyrone are chasing a first Anglo-Celt triumph since 2021 and they face a Cavan side which has already knocked out Monaghan in the preliminary round. Cavan who finished third in Division Two, scored two injury-time goals to edge past their derby rivals 3-12 to 1-12 at Clones. Dooher is wary of Cavan's threat and knows there is room for improvement after a league campaign that included a 5-18 to 0-12 mauling by All-Ireland champions Dublin. Dooher added: \"The league ended on a disappointing note - we were inconsistent. Thankfully we got enough to stay in Division One which is important for the development of young players.  \"A 21-point defeat is not something we ever go out and want. We've a significant bit of work to do from that match to turn things around. \"We'll take the learning on board from the Dublin match and hopefully address some of those deficits we had and get ready to be the best we can be for Cavan.  \"The players have come out and have acquitted themselves as well as they can - they work hard every night in training. \"Cavan finishing just below Donegal and Armagh [in Division Two], who are two of the favourites for the Ulster Championship. That shows where Cavan are and they were unlucky to be behind those two. \"The Ulster Championship is really competitive and on any given day they can beat anyone. \"I enjoy every day I go out with these boys, every day I go training. It's a real honour for us and privilege to be in that position where we can do the best for Tyrone football and try to advance the cause as much as possible.\" The winner of the Breffni showdown will face Derry or Donegal in the semi-finals.

        "text": " On Saturday evening, as Celtic Park bathed in sunshine and became awash with red and white and green and gold in the minutes before throw-in, it was difficult not to feel like we were about to be truly captivated by the Ulster Championship for the first time this year.  Thankfully it wasn't a false dawn.   Derry, viewed by many as strong All-Ireland contenders, were chasing the win that would set them on the road to three-in-a-row.  As Division One champions, Mickey Harte's men came to Celtic Park as deserved favourites.  And while losing here won't alter the general consensus that the Oak Leafers can go all the way this year, Jim McGuinness and Donegal have well and truly entered the conversation. \"I'm very, very happy,\" McGuinness told BBC Sport NI. \"Their application was great, the work-rate was great, tactically they nailed everything really.  \"They were tuned in to what we were trying to achieve and thankfully it worked out for us.\" This win, delivered by a ravenous Donegal performance that made Derry look \"second class\", as Harte put it, gives momentum not only to the Tir Chonaill men but the Ulster Championship itself after three largely uninspiring games. With Tyrone - around whom there is always much intrigue - getting their campaign underway on Sunday and Armagh and Down already in the semi-finals, it's suddenly shaping up nicely.  'It's huge for the county and the people of Donegal' 'Superb' Donegal made us look 'second class' - Harte After returning to Donegal last year and seeing his side pitted against Derry in the Ulster quarter-finals, McGuinness spoke about long-time adversary Harte with deep reverence.  He readily admitted to having lost sleep in the past before big championship meetings with Harte's Tyrone, but while speaking to reporters after Donegal's win, McGuinness revealed that he had slept fine in the nights leading up to Saturday's match. So, too, had his players. That much was clear as they repeatedly tore through Derry to send a statement to the rest of Ulster and beyond.  McGuinness and his players will sleep well this weekend. It may be a different story for Derry, of course, and their goalkeeper Odhran Lynch, for whom the sight of looking over his shoulder to see Daire O Baoill lobbing the ball over his head as he scrambled back to his goal may haunt his dreams.  Donegal are no strangers to nightmares themselves. They were in turmoil last year. Between managerial changes and heavy defeats, they looked a team in disarray.  But with a Division Two title in the bag, they have steadied the ship under McGuinness, and on Saturday they looked an entirely different animal to the disillusioned bunch who were ushered out of Ulster by Down last year. Collectively they were a joy to behold. Ryan McHugh, absent last year, looked back to his electrifying best, Jason McGee produced a massive midfield performance to stand up to Derry's Conor Glass-Brendan Rogers axis while Brendan McCole ensured Shane McGuigan had one of his quietest games in a while.  O Baoill even managed to do to Lynch what he did to Fermanagh's Ross Bogue earlier this year. But McGuinness - back in the Ulster Championship for the first time since the 2014 final - was not about to carried away given what lies ahead.  He had six months to fine tune his masterplan for Derry. He has just a week to plot either Tyrone or Cavan's downfall.  \"I hope that it helps a lot, I hope it will add a lot to the belief, but the problem is we have an eight-day turnaround,\" McGuinness told a large group of reporters as the temperature plummeted outside the Celtic Park changing rooms.  \"We've got to get ready to go again and there's no time to sit on anything. We've got to get straight into it now.  \"It feels good to take a breather tonight and get up the road to watch the game tomorrow. Knowing you're through is brilliant but as soon as you know who's coming out of that game, it'll be full-on for another week. \"It's very difficult to do your job in a week. It's almost impossible. It's a bandage over a dam situation.\" McGuinness, as he has done so often in the past, edged the tactical battle. His players utilised Shaun Patton's kick-outs to build their attacks to great effect before the goalkeeper was forced off in the second half with an injury.  The Donegal boss is regarded as one of Gaelic football's master tacticians, but he admits his squad may need to draw more on energy and momentum than tactical innovation before next week's semi-final.  \"We must try, I think, to harness the energy from the performance as opposed to the tactical build-up for the next one,\" observed McGuinness, who improved his tally over Harte in championship fare to 4-0.  Derry must now regroup after a first provincial defeat in three years.  In the grand scheme, this defeat may prove a turning point in pursuit of the ultimate prize, but Harte was quick to dismiss talk of Derry having taken their eye off the ball in Ulster.  \"I don't think so, they obviously had the chance to go for three in a row and that was something special, so I don't think they've been taking this championship lightly,\" he said of his players. \"But Donegal very much had their sights set on this game from a long way back. They put a huge amount of work to make this a real good day for them and they carried that through. \"You have to hand it to them. They did what they set out to do very well and we didn't do a lot of what we've been doing all year to the high standard that we have been doing.\""

        "text": " Armagh boss Kieran McGeeney is content that his side face a Division Two final against Donegal a fortnight before their Ulster SFC opener even though promotion has already been secured. McGeeney's team outclassed Cavan 2-21 to 0-12 to emphatically seal promotion.  He launched a stout defence of modern day football in backing league finals some view as unnecessary in a packed inter-county calendar. \"Any chance we get to promote our sport, we should do it,\" McGeeney said. \"I think we spend our time in the GAA complaining. No matter what we do, it's always wrong. \"In every other sport the league is where it's going. We should be playing home and away games [in the Allianz League]. \"The sport is getting bigger in spite of what people are saying. More and more people are watching it. There are more and more scores but unfortunately all the ex-players think nobody is as good as them. \"In general if you look at the scorelines over the last couple of years, especially in Division One, most teams are hitting 19 or 20 scores.  \"In our time, I don't think we ever did that\u00e2\u0080\u00a6..and I mean ever.  \"So if you have chances to put those things on display\u00e2\u0080\u00a6..it's hard squishing it in I know but I think any chance we get to promote our sport, we should do it.\" Despite being regarded as one of the most dedicated players of his era, Armagh's 2002 All-Ireland winning captain said he wasn't sure he would have the necessary attributes for the modern day game. \"It's faster, it's quicker. It's just a far better game and smarter. Whether you would be fit to play if or not?  \"It's funny listening to [former] players in WhatsApp groups talking about saving football. They should take a look at their own games. What they were at themselves when they were there.  \"If they wanted to save football, maybe they shouldn't have played. That's the sort of rhetoric that we're coming out with. I don't see it. I really don't.  \"I just think gaelic football is a brilliant sport. It's just badly promoted.\" Saturday's thumping victory over a Cavan team that still had promotion ambitions of their own going into the game saw the Orchard men lead 2-12 to 0-4 at the break, helped by a goal from corner-back Peter McGrane and Conor Turbitt's penalty. The victory sealed promotion with a game to spare with Armagh now facing a dead rubber in Cork next from their perspective although the Rebels may need something from the game amid their battle against relegation.  In the immediate aftermath of Saturday's win, McGeeney suggested that wholesale changes for next weekend's game are unlikely.  \"I don't think it works that way.  I've done that before in other divisions. You have to go out to win. Cork are a good team and again, you saw today with Louth [who beat Fermanagh 6-17 to 0-11].  \"Louth were losing games by the bare minimum and they've been missing goals and today they hit them.\" And as regards the Division Two Final on 31 March, McGeeney added: \"There is no team that will go out to lose.  \"Definitely not. I'm sure Donegal will want to beat us and we'll want to win.  We're out in the championship is it two weeks after that [against Fermanagh at Brewster Park].  \"Training camps and all that sort of stuff that you are trying to fit in. It's quite difficult but if you'd asked me at the start of the year would I like that quandary, I'd have taken it.\" "

In recent years, the hurling and football deciders have been played by the end of July which hasn't met with universal approval. Speaking to GAAGO's new discussion forum, Burns said the door isn't closed to a return to the traditional dates. \"There is a way of achieving that,\" said the GAA president.  \"The difficulty is the people who are going to have to compromise are the counties with their own championships.\" Burns says that a master fixtures plan for club championships in all counties would have to be devised for a return to September finals to be seriously considered. \"If you are organising the GAA master fixtures plan you have to bump into 32 master fixture-making bodies, higher education, and multiply that by two as you have hurling and football. \"And then within that you have seven or eight different iterations of [club] championships.  \"It is totally ridiculous to think that we can organise a master fixtures plan around that.\" GAA director general Tom Ryan suggested last year that a return to September finals was highly unlikely but many prominent figure in the sport, including Donegal football manager Jim McGuinness, have spoken of unhappiness at the inter-county championships being completed prior to the arrival of the late summer months.

        "text": " Charlie Smyth says \"this is where the real work starts\" after signing a three-year contract with the NFL's New Orleans Saints.  The 22-year-old, who has come from Gaelic football, secured a deal last week after impressing at trials. Smyth hopes to make the Saints' roster before the start of the 2024 NFL season in September. \"I feel like I've got the ability to kick in this league and to kick for the Saints,\" said the Down GAA goalkeeper. \"It's been an unbelievable journey just to get to this point, but now I know I'm in the league, the Saints have signed me, but now it's time to get to work. This is where the real work starts.\" As an Ulster Under-20 Championship winner with Down in 2021, Smyth had a bright future in Gaelic football, the sport he has played his entire life.  However, after deciding to pursue his dream of playing in the NFL, he started to train with Tadhg Leader, a kicking coach for the NFL international player pathway (IPP) programme.  Along with Rory Beggan, Wicklow's Mark Jackson and former Connacht rugby player Darragh Leader, Smyth attended the NFL Combine in Indianapolis in early March. Having impressed at the Combine and at pro-day trials, Mayobridge native Smyth was invited to the Saints' training facility before signing the contract. Over the summer, Smyth will compete with current Saints kicker Blake Grupe for the spot in the active roster.  Those who miss out on the 53-player active roster are either released or retained on the practice squad, where players can still earn sizeable salaries and be promoted to the active roster during the course of the season. However, while he concedes there is a lot of work to be done to make the Saints team, Smyth says he is determined to make the starting team and blaze a trail for Irish youngsters harbouring similar ambitions.  \"I want the starting job, that's why I'm here,\" said Smyth, who was speaking to American reporters remotely on Monday after returning home to Mayobridge last week.  \"I felt like this is a great opportunity to do that. I know obviously Blake Grupe is an unbelievable kicker of a football as well and I know it's going to be very difficult.\" Smyth, who is the first Irish player to sign with an NFL team via the IPP, added: \"But it's the mindset I have, I don't want to be one of those boys who comes through the IPP to sit on the practice squad for three years, earn a wee bit of money and then go back home.  \"That's not why I'm here. I want to do this because I want to play. We've played Gaelic football all our lives for no pay. We do it for the passion and that's what I'm doing.  \"For me, it's not about money, it's about being the best version of myself and representing my country on a world stage and inspiring younger lads to follow suit.\" Get American Football alerts in the BBC Sport app NFL fixtures and results | NFL tables"

        "text": " Orchard boss Greg McGonigle hopes they can bring momentum into the All-Ireland series after beating Kerry in the Division One final. Armagh secured a first top-flight title with a 2-12 to 2-9 victory over the champions in Sunday's decider at Croke Park.  \"It's a great place to be on 7 April,\" said a delighted McGonigle. \"Looking forward with stuff to prepare for coming into the Ulster championship and then the All-Ireland series.  Having lost out by three points to the Kingdom in the Division Two decider two years ago, this was a sweet victory for an Armagh side that were also appearing in their maiden top-tier league showpiece.  The sides went in level at 1-4 apiece at the break and Niamh Ni Chonchuir's goal helped Kerry go in front before Aimee Mackin hit the roof of the net as Armagh fought back for the win. Mackin and Kelly Mallon starred for the Ulster side as they contributed a combined 1-9.  \"From a defensive point of view, we'd be happy with where we are at, but again we could have been possibly a little bit more clinical up front - we maybe left a couple of chances behind us,\" added McGonigle. \"We talked about teams probably going to have purple patches or you're going to make mistakes and we say it's always about reaction.  \"It's responding, it's not about reacting and not going into ourselves. In regards of trying to get back up and get a score as soon as we can, we reacted very well to conceding an early second half [goal] .\"  "

        "text": " It was a tough start to the Leinster Hurling Championship for Antrim at Nowlan Park on Sunday as Kilkenny romped to a comprehensive 5-30 to 0-13 win. There was no mercy shown by the Cats who were keen to lay down a marker and they did just that, dominating from start to finish to give Antrim no encouragement of causing an upset. They were simply stronger, sharper and playing the game at a different pace than Antrim who couldn't get into it at all. After the initial exchanges that saw TJ Reid land two frees to Conal Cunning's one, Kilkenny began to open their shoulders with Adrian Mullen, Richie Reid and John Donnelly Landon from play. The Saffrons replied with Cunning frees either side of their first from play by James McNaughton, the first of those placed balls coming when Eoghan Campbell was adjudged to have been trailed down just outside the area with a goal on. Kilkenny were dominating the restart with Antrim struggling to win primary possession and after points from Cian Kenny and Martin Keoghan, the goal they had been threatening arrived as Paddy Deegan fetched an Antrim poc-out, went long to TJ Reid who beat Ryan McGarry in the air before scampering through for goal. Two points followed before Antrim goalkeeper Ryan Elliott was sin-binned for taking down Keoghan outside the area but was deemed a penalty infringement. Tiernan Smyth came in with Niall McKenna making way for 10 minutes and the Ballycastle man made a stunning save from Reid's penalty. A Conor McCann score at the other end was Antrim's response, yet although the wides were mounting for Kilkenny with nine in the opening half, there were enough scores to supplement as they led 1-15 to 0-7 at the break. It took Kilkenny a few minutes to get going in the second period with Reid again getting them going from a free with John Donnelly and Shane Murphy chipping in. Antrim were making little to no headway, chipping in with the odd sporadic score, but Kilkenny were in overdrive with their bench paving their worth as Owen Wall got in for their second goal on 49 minutes. Billy Drennan would deputise nicely for TJ Reid with a haul of 1-6 between frees and play, his goal coming from a later penalty after Keoghan was tripped by Conor Boyd outside the area but deemed a goalscoring chance to earn another black card. Prior to that, Wall had blasted home his second goal and Gear\u00c3\u00b3id Dunne also rattled the net to cap a hugely impressive display from Derek Lyng's men, while Antrim will now seek to bounce back when they host Wexford next week."

        "text": " Derry manager Mickey Harte feels scrapping League finals would be \"a disgrace\" and said it would have been an \"anti-climax\" if his side had won the Division One title after Sunday's 2-19 to 1-9 win over Roscommon. There have been some calls to get rid of League finals to give teams more time to prepare for the Championship. Derry face Dublin in the Division One final on Easter Sunday at Croke Park. \"I think it would be a disgrace to take away the league final,\" Harte said. After a strong first campaign under former Tyrone boss Harte, Derry finished top of the Division One table after the regulation seven games with 12 points. They will play All-Ireland champions Dublin, who finished second on 10 points, in the final in Croke Park on Easter Sunday. Derry top Division One as Dublin hammer Tyrone \"I imagine for the teams down the leagues, the chance to play a league final in Croke Park is the highlight of their year,\" said the Derry boss. \"It is as big a day as they are going to get for a lot of them, so why would you take that away? \"It would be an anti-climax if today the league was over and the team that is ahead would win the league. I would not like that. \"I don't know what is the big deal. One more week's football and shoving the championship on a week, so be it.\" Harte confirmed that Gareth McKinless suffered a broken nose early in Sunday's game and said he was hopeful he could play \"in the not too distant future\" but he would leave the decision in the hands of his medical team. Asked if he had any chance of lining out in next Sunday's league final, he replied: \"It seems highly unlikely but sure who knows, strange things happen\". Derry blew Roscommon away in the final half hour to relegate the yo-yo county from the top flight for the fourth time in eight seasons and set Derry on course for another league final against Dublin. The two contested the Division Two final last year, won by the Dubs. Harte has an excellent record in the competition, having led Tyrone to Division One glory in 2003 and Louth to the Division Four final in 2021. Another league final appearance never looked in doubt yesterday, though they were sloppy enough in the first half against the Roscommon, with Harte admitting a repeat of their opening 40 minutes would not be good enough next week. \"They (Roscommon) were going to come with all guns blazing and they're coming fighting for their life and they proved that for 45 minutes, but you just have to get your head around that. \"It is good that you can turn in a higher level of performance when it's needed. \"There's days you can do that and there's days you might not get away with that, you need to be more consistent and play at a higher level across the whole game. \"We have to learn as we go as well. Obviously next week the level of our performance in the first 40, 45 minutes wouldn't leave us in a very good place.\" Asked if playing All-Ireland champions Dublin three weeks before hosting Donegal in the Ulster Championship would be of benefit to Derry, Harte replied: \"there's a benefit depending on the outcome\". \"There could be a low benefit if the outcome isn't what you'd want it to be. \"We seen what they did (to Tyrone) today and they're mean and hungry. They don't take much sympathy on anyone else.\" The introduction of Matthew Downey late on made him the 37th different player Harte has played in 11 McKenna Cup and league games as Derry manager. They are also hitting some big scores with forwards taking the burden off Shane McGuigan and Harte has to be happy with where Derry are at, with the Championship close. \"There's nothing perfect in this life but its progress. \"We are introducing more players to this level of competition and you are introducing hem at the highest level of league football here and that is good. \"But the Championship takes on a life of its own so we have to go and continue and try blood a few more in the Championship if we can as well and see where that takes us.\""

        "text": " Sign up for notifications to the latest Insight features via the BBC Sport app and read the latest in the series here. Ronda Rousey sits in silence on the cold concrete floor of the Marvel Stadium medical room in Melbourne, Australia. There are tears running down her cheeks. She is shivering, covered in sweat and can taste blood in her mouth. Outside, Rousey can hear laughter and tens of thousands of cheering fans. It is November 2015 and Rousey has just lost her UFC bantamweight title via a chastening head-kick knockout by fellow American Holly Holm. Her coaching team surround her, solemn, their heads lowered. In the middle of it all, Rousey's mind is a swirl of suicidal thoughts and the most \"intense pain, misery, embarrassment and shame\" she has ever felt. It is an experience Rousey, 37, describes in her new book Our Fight as \"the worst moment of the worst day\" of her life. But amid the desolation, Rousey hears eight words from her husband-to-be Travis Browne which will change the course of her life: \"You are so much more than a fighter.\" Rousey didn't believe him at the time. Now she can look back, nine years on, and appreciate the meaning behind those words. In a wide-ranging interview with BBC Sport in New York, Rousey reveals how she climbed out of a dark place to find fulfilment in her life outside fighting. But to understand Rousey, you have to follow the route down to her lowest point. Rousey flicks her head around as she remembers her first day fighting - 26 years ago. \"I didn't have a hair tie, so my hair was going all over the place and crazy,\" she says, swinging her ponytail to mimic the moment she first tried judo. \"I remember I got off the mat and Blinky [Richard Elizalde], my first coach, said: 'It's a lot more fun than swimming isn't it?'\" Rousey's first sporting love had been swimming, but she would soon follow in her mother AnnMaria De Mars' footsteps. De Mars was the first American to win a gold medal at the World Judo Championships, but her influence on her daughter goes far beyond sport. She was left to raise her three daughters when tragedy struck the family. Rousey was eight years old when her father, whose health had deteriorated after a sledding accident, killed himself. The impact De Mars has had on Rousey and her career is evident. \"The first American world champion in judo was a woman, and it was her,\" says Rousey. \"And having her just walk through the living room made it feel so much more attainable for me to want to do just as much, even more.\" Rousey would narrowly miss out on her dream of winning Olympic gold in judo, taking bronze at the 2008 Beijing Olympics, but glory and fame would follow in the next stage of her career as she transitioned to mixed martial arts. She tore though the professional ranks, winning her first 12 bouts, 11 of those victories coming in the first round. In doing so, she captured the UFC bantamweight title and a mainstream audience, elevating MMA into the public consciousness. Fans weren't drawn in just by the dominant nature of Rousey's performances, where typically she would utilise her judo background in taking opponents down before submitting them via armbar. It was the bravado she brought too. \"I felt like women's combat sports was missing showmanship,\" says Rousey. \"A lot of times when women are coming to a space where they're not entirely welcome, they try to make as few waves as possible. I needed to make as many as possible in order to fight for our place there, instead of politely asking for permission for it.\" She remains the most popular female athlete on Instagram, with her 17.5 million-strong following eclipsing even that of tennis' Serena Williams. But her rise to UFC superstardom may never have happened if Rousey's charisma and clinical style hadn't forced the promotion's president Dana White to change his mind. In January 2011, White confidently declared women would \"never\" fight in his organisation., external Less than two years later, he signed Rousey as UFC's first female athlete. Rousey took White's initial opinion as a \"personal challenge\". \"When I first saw [White's interview], my first thought was 'oh well, he hasn't met me yet',\" she says.  \"It just felt like a matter of time before our paths would cross and I changed his mind.\" Rousey explains why creating spaces for women in male-dominated circles has been important to her throughout her career. \"Oh, I think it comes from being a woman that's amazing at something,\" Rousey says with a wry smile. \"You have to work twice as hard and do twice as much to get half the respect. \"You have a right to be there. And sometimes when you're the only woman in the room, it's easy to not feel like that, to feel out of place. But you are in your place - you don't need to shrink and to try and fit in the little spaces. You're allowed to spread out and to take the space that you deserve.\"  On the upper floors of the prestigious New York Athletic Club on the fringes of Central Park - where this interview is taking place - there is a hall of fame celebrating its members' sporting successes. Among the rows of trophies, and the black-and-white images of triumphant athletes, hangs a portrait of a 21-year-old Rousey following her Olympic bronze success in 2008.  The 2024 version of Rousey enters the room wearing a white tunic and a superstar aura. But for every sprinkle of stardust there are also moments of profound vulnerability and splashes of self-deprecating humour. After coming third at Beijing 2008, Rousey's aim was to translate her success into enough money to buy her first car. Now she and her husband own a ranch in Oregon comprising just less than 4,000 acres. Rousey became a gardener during one of her darkest periods. Her harrowing defeat by Holm was followed by a first-round stoppage defeat by Amanda Nunes and immediate retirement from MMA. She had gone from apparent invincibility - a 2015 Washington Post article described her as \"too good\" for her own sport, external - to sudden ignominy in little more than a year. Rousey became depressed. \"It wasn't easy. It took a lot of time, chocolate crepes, weed, World of Warcraft, and then love and kisses from my husband and patience from my family to get through it,\" says Rousey. After some words of encouragement from Browne, Rousey decided to start gardening. \"I was really excited when I finally got a plant to grow, but then it was immediately eaten by a squirrel,\" laughs Rousey.  \"So the next time I got a little sprout, I built a little Fort Knox around it. And, for the first time, I focused on where I'd succeeded instead of where I'd failed. \"Not everything is the Olympic finals. But I'd been treating my whole life as if it was since I was six and it was hard to break out of it.\" Rousey practices regenerative agriculture, which produces environmental benefits as well as food. When Rousey describes the ranch, which is called Browsey Acres, her eyes light up and she talks a little faster. \"I think regenerative agriculture is one of the most scalable solutions to climate change that's out there right now,\" says Rousey. \"Our animals are being treated humanely and are able to exhibit natural behaviours. It just feels like being part of the solution, when so much of the world around us feels like a problem.\" In 2021, Rousey became a mother for the first time, giving birth to her daughter Po. It has clarified what really matters going forward. \"We're trying to leave solutions for our kids and not just a pile of money that's lit on fire,\" says Rousey.  \"We're trying to address these crises that she's inevitably going to have to face in her lifetime like climate change. It's something that really weighs on my worries for my children in the future.  \"This is basically the war effort of our time, and what deserves all of our time and energy, because every single bit that we put into it is us putting into our children.\" Before the interview starts, Rousey reveals she has been pleasantly surprised by the positive reaction to her new book. Part of her had expected a negative response. She is used to adversity. She has been scrutinised intensely by media and fans throughout her career, from her early days as a judoka through to her most recent stint as a wrestler in the WWE. \"It really feels like everyone's always going to define me by my failures, but I know that I created the most efficient fighting style that ever existed and I'm proud of that,\" says Rousey.  Critics have long pointed to Rousey's difficulty in accepting defeat and her refusal to credit opponents who have beaten her, such as Holm and Nunes. Rousey admits it's something she has always struggled with, comparing the sensation of defeat to grief.  \"Ever since I was a little kid I had a huge problem with it. I lost my first junior nationals when I locked myself in my bedroom and cried for a week. I was 13 years old,\" she says.   But Rousey's hatred of defeat is also what fuelled her victories, with her mother encouraging her to use it as a \"weapon\". \"One of the advantages I had over the other girls was that when I was fighting, I wanted it more than them. And I think one thing that's required in order to be a special champion is you have to be willing to get your heart broken,\" says Rousey. \"I think that's one thing that made me great, because I was willing to get my heart broken over and over and over again and not allow myself to stop caring as much as others did.\" Rousey has always fought strongly for her beliefs. It is a trait that defined her five-year stint in professional wrestling promotion WWE. She describes frustrations at women's matches being cut shorter in favour of men's and a lack of planning and preparation time. \"Initially I wanted to do something that was just for fun, that wasn't competition and just have a good time with my girlfriends,\" she says \"But that kind of got hijacked by the whole women's Evolution [a landmark all-women event headlined by Rousey in October 2018] and trying to accomplish all of these things. \"The WWE were so entrenched in doing things that they've always done, that they just wanted to be left alone to be good enough.\"  Rousey's WWE stint could serve as a metaphor for her entire career. \"I was like 'I can't be associated with mediocrity'. I can't stay here and just be good enough,\" she adds. Despite WWE's expansion of its female roster and its appointment of women to prominent roles behind the scenes, Rousey left the organisation last year. BBC Sport has approached the WWE for comment. Before the interviews ends, Rousey is asked what comes next, which she answers with a beaming smile. \"I feel like I've learned so much from judo, UFC and pro wrestling, that I would love to be the next Bruce Lee,\" says Rousey.  \"I don't know if it's ever gonna come along, but also nobody wrote Enter the Dragon and had it handed to them - they had go out there and make it happen. So maybe I'll do something similar one day.  \"Or maybe, you know, I'll just be chilling with my cows.\"  Maybe, but 'just chilling' would be the most dramatic career change of all for Rousey.

Creasey, 36, is the first Englishman to win an Oktagon belt. The former Cage Warriors champion won every round, repeatedly tagging Aby with left hands and painful leg kicks. \"The feeling is unmatched,\" Creasey said of the win. \"Pure elation to confirm myself as a world-class athlete.\" Creasey improved his record to 19 wins, with five defeats, while Aby slipped to his ninth career loss. Aby was the man with the most vocal support inside the Resorts World Arena and was aiming to win the title having overcome cystic fibrosis as a child and cancer later in life. Creasey was full of praise for his opponent, who he also beat in 2021 on points, paying tribute to his resilience inside and outside the cage. Aby promised himself he would win a MMA title after his health issues. \"I couldn't have lost to a better person,\" Aby said. \"I haven't won again tonight. I'm not coming away as a world champion. It hurts. It hurts a lot but maybe I am a winner because of all those people up there [in the stands]. \"For all those people that support me, that makes me a winner as well.\""

        "text": " It is a question which is brought up often in mixed martial arts circles: who is the greatest UFC fighter of all time? With the promotion having just hosted its landmark UFC 300 event in Las Vegas, BBC Sport asked their readers to vote for their UFC 'GOAT' of the past 30 years. Fighters were chosen based on skill, their records, popularity and impact their careers have had on the growth of the UFC. Russia's Khabib Nurmagomedov, who retired with an undefeated record, was selected by BBC Sport readers, getting 32% of the votes compared to American Jon Jones who received 25%. Jones' legacy as the most dominant light-heavyweight champion in UFC history was cemented before he secured the heavyweight title last year. The American is a controversial figure outside the octagon but has a glittering resume, boasting 27 wins with his sole defeat coming via a disqualification against Matt Hamill in 2009. The first simultaneous two-division champion in UFC history, few can rival McGregor's impact in helping expose MMA to a wider audience with the Irishman being the biggest draw in the promotion's history. The UFC's only two-time double champion, Brazil's Nunes dominated the featherweight and bantamweight divisions for the best part of five years. Russia's Nurmagomedov retired in 2020 having gone the entirety of his 29-fight career undefeated - a feat which has never been replicated in the UFC. The first woman to be signed by the UFC, Rousey paved the way for her peers to compete at the highest level alongside the men. A former bantamweight champion who defended her title six times, the American's dominance inside the octagon and bravado outside it helped expose the UFC to a wider audience. Canada's St-Pierre is widely regarded as the greatest UFC welterweight of all time, defending his belt a record nine times in the division, before winning the middleweight belt in the final fight of his career in 2017. Brazil's Silva holds the longest win streak in UFC history with 16 victories as he dominated the middleweight division for seven years from 2006 during his run as champion."

I was earning just enough to get diesel to fill my car and buy myself food. I had no options, I didn't know where I was going.\" Moore says his strongest attribute is his mental strength, and this is what kept him positive during difficult moments. He never slacked and stayed committed to his training, waiting patiently for his next fight opportunity. Eventually it would come in September 2022 in the form of Bellator's then fifth-ranked light-heavyweight Karl Albrektsson, with Moore triumphing in a contest he says he was \"never supposed to win\". Winning the Bellator title is personal - Edwards 'I don't fear anything' - Gallagher on Higo contest UFC agrees $335m settlement with former fighters \"I was just determined to get a fight. I knew getting a couple of good wins can fix everything. In our sport if you keep winning you're going to get recognised, no matter what's going on,\" said Moore. The victory would kickstart his career, with two more wins to follow. On Friday he will face American Corey Anderson for the vacant light-heavyweight title at the Bellator Champions Series at the SSE Arena in his hometown Belfast. \"No matter what happens in this fight, I'm going to be financially secure for a long, long time,\" said Moore.  \"If you'd have told me this two years ago I'd be like 'No, you're full of it, it's impossible'. But it's happened, it's crazy when I think about it, it's a mad story. \"It feels like the stars have aligned for me. I'm not really superstitious but this feels like it's meant to be my night. Taking in everything that's happened, it almost feels too good to be true.\" Moore started his professional career in 2011 and has won 12 of 14 fights, including his past four. If he beats 34-year-old Anderson, he will become the first Irish champion in Bellator history and his nation's first title holder in a global MMA promotion since Conor McGregor captured the UFC lightweight belt in 2016. Moore says he gets nervous speaking to the media, adding \"it's something he'll have to get used to\" should he win the title, amid the extra attention champions receive.  \"I get more nervous doing this than fighting. You can put me in a cage in front of 20,000 people but if you put me on camera, in front of a microphone, I start to sweat,\" said Moore.  \"It's weird, I just don't like it. But it's something I'll have to get used to because the position I'm in now in my career it's going to be more and more common, so I need to get used to it and keep doing it.\" Despite his nerves, Moore appears confident, and is kind and down to earth throughout the interview, citing his father as the biggest influence on his career and personality. \"From a kid, my dad's always gone to the gym. He's always been in shape and watching him train and how he lived is the type of man I wanted to be,\" said Moore. \"Anyone who knows my dad says he's one of the nicest and best guys you'll ever meet. I just followed in his footsteps, and tried to be like my dad. If I can he half as good as him I'm doing something right. \"And it's not even just fighting but my mannerisms, the way I treat people. Even in the smallest decisions I make I think 'what would my dad do? How would he react'?\" Anderson is a former Bellator light-heavyweight title challenger, suffering a defeat by Vadim Nemkov in 2022. Before signing with Bellator he was in the UFC, and has won 17 of his 24 professional fights. Moore's bout with Anderson was set up when former champion Nemkov vacated the title to move up to heavyweight. Moore glows when he visualises winning the belt in front of his home crowd.  \"It'll be amazing. The first Irish guy to be a Bellator world champion. These are things I can show my kids, my grandkids what I was like one day,\" said Moore.  \"When I'm fat and out of shape, that was me one day.\""

        "text": " Trailblazing Scottish UFC star Joanne Wood will retire from the sport after this weekend's bout with Ukraine's Maryna Moroz, saying: \"I just feel now is the time.\" The 38-year-old, who was Scotland's first professional female MMA fighter, brings the curtain down on her career on the UFC 299 card in Miami. Wood aims to go out on a high and expects to \"cry straight after\". \"It sure is my last fight,\" she told BBC Scotland. \"I want to retire on a good note and feeling good. I feel like when you know you know, so it is definitely going to be my last fight in the octagon. \"I don't want to be going out there and not having the skill, that fight in me - I have still got all those things, so I want to retire on that note, I don't want to be forcing myself to do this. \"I can say, 'That is it, I am done and my body is still good, I could keep fighting but I choose not to.' \"I am ready to lay it all out there and excited at the thought of it being my last one. I am going to do this fight and then I can let it flow and I am sure I will cry straight after.\" Britain's Ditcheva joins $1m 2024 PFL season Watch every Born to Brawl episode After starring on the kickboxing scene, 'JoJo' made her pro MMA debut in 2012. The fighter from Irvine, who is now based in Las Vegas, believes the showdown with Moroz on Saturday is the perfect way to round off a career in which she has put together a record of 16 wins and eight losses. \"I love the fight, I didn't ask for this fight but I feel this is a full-circle moment,\" Wood said. \"She gave me my first loss and it is the perfect ending, perfect fight. Go out there and get some revenge and then ride off into the sunset. \"I am still going to train, I love MMA and have a lot of team-mates still fighting, so I am going to still be in the gym every day training with them.\" The MMA landscape has changed since Wood first entered the fray 12 years ago, with a number of female fighters now making their mark and sharing the limelight at the top level. \"Dana White [the UFC president] said there weren't going to be any female fighters in the UFC,\" said Wood. \"That changed, so anything is possible and I am really proud to be part of the growth in female MMA and I can just see it getting better and better, more opportunities. \"I remember the first year I was like, 'I don't know if I am going to be able to do this.' To go from that thought to go to where I am now at the end of my career, I am like, 'Wow, it actually happened.'\""

        "text": " When Jim Miller walks out at a sold out T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas to face Bobby Green at UFC 300 on Saturday, he will set a unique record. The American lightweight is the only athlete who also fought at the UFC's landmark 100 and 200 events. The 40-year-old was victorious at both, beating Mac Danzig in 2009 and Takanori Gomi in 2016. When Miller faced the press at the pre-fight media conference, he sported a commemorative UFC 100 jacket to celebrate his achievement. \"This is the first time I've ever worn it. I pulled it out of the closet, there's still dog hair on it. It's been in the closet for 15 years and I was like 'do you know what, this is the week to bring this out',\" said Miller. \"Funnily enough, all the fighters are getting a UFC 300 jacket. But nobody else on the card has got this puppy.\" Fighters to get $300,000 bonuses at UFC 300 Miller debuted in the UFC in 2008 and holds the record for the most fights in the organisation at 43 and the most wins, totalling 26. What makes Miller's longevity more remarkable is that before UFC 200, he was having doubts if he would make it to the event. Miller was suffering from Lyme disease - a condition caught from tick bites with symptoms including tiredness and loss of energy. \"When I first started talking about [UFC 300] I was like 'OK, maybe I'll drag myself to that card', because that's what I was doing for 200 - I was having a really rough time,\" said Miller. \"I feel I have four parts to my career - the prelim career, Lyme disease, coming out of Lyme and figuring out how to make this work being over 35. And now I've figured it out and got the right people around me.\" Miller has never fought for a title during his 16-year UFC career but championships will not define his legacy. \"Honestly I've received nothing but respect from my peers and that means a lot to me,\" said Miller. \"I respect everyone I stand across from in the octagon, because this is not an easy life, it's not an easy lifestyle. A lot of sacrifices have to be made. \"We're more peers than it's made out to be. Everybody loves the drama and the bickering - it sells. But it's something special to be here, to set your feet off on that canvas.\" The landmark 300 event boasts a strong card top to bottom, with 12 current or former champions in action.  The UFC's efforts in producing a star-studded show are synonymous with past centenary events, with WWE star Brock Lesnar fighting at both, while Conor McGregor and Jon Jones were also originally in contention to appear at 200 before their bouts were cancelled.  Headlining UFC 300 is a light-heavyweight title bout between Brazil's champion Alex Pereira and American Jamahal Hill, who vacated the belt in July 2023 after rupturing an Achilles tendon. The bout was finalised following weeks of negotiations between the UFC and various fighters which didn't come to fruition, including Leon Edwards, Israel Adesanya and Dricus du Plessis. The co-main event sees Zhang Weili defend her strawweight belt against compatriot Yan Xiaonan in the first all-Chinese Championship fight in UFC history. Elsewhere, Justin Gaethje will defend the symbolic BMF title against fellow American Max Holloway in a lightweight contest. The belt is awarded to the 'baddest' fighter in the UFC and has only been contested twice since its inauguration in 2019. Double Olympic judo gold medallist Kayla Harrison is also making her UFC debut, taking on former champion Holly Holm in a bantamweight matchup. American Harrison, who is a two-time PFL lightweight title holder, believes she can replicate her past success in her new home. \"I've always taken big risks in my career and this is the biggest. UFC 300 versus Holly Holm, a new weight class, new promotion, legend of the sport, I'm all in, I'm excited,\" said the 33-year-old. \"The goal is not to be a star but to be UFC champion and be so good you can't ignore me. And then to use this platform to change the world how I want to. \"I just want to be so good you guys have no choice but to call me 'The Queen'.\""

        "text": " Ronda Rousey says she hid \"concussions and neurological injuries\" for years during her trailblazing run as UFC bantamweight champion. American Rousey, 37, became the first woman to join the UFC in 2012, defending her title six times before defeat by Holly Holm in 2015. Rousey says the loss caused her to \"self-assess\" her career for the sake of her long-term health. \"It's hard to look at footage of that match,\" Rousey told BBC Sport.  \"Because I can literally see in my eyes I'm suffering from a neurological injury decades in the making. \"It [ticks] me off when people see that and say, 'this is Ronda being outclassed'. That's me with my brain not properly working.\" Rousey, speaking following the release of her new book Our Fight, revealed how a decade's worth of concussions suffered during her judo career, where she won Olympic bronze for the USA in 2008, affected her UFC run. Rousey stops and takes a deep breath as she describes her wellbeing going into the Holm fight, which she lost via a head kick knockout in the second round. \"I was concussed going into that fight - I fell down the stairs and knocked myself out two weeks before,\" she recalled. \"But I had been hiding concussions and neurological injuries for so long that it just became part of it. And that was the point I was forced to really self-assess and be like, 'your brain has taken too much damage for too many years'.\" Rousey would fight once more in a stoppage defeat by Amanda Nunes 13 months after the loss to Holm, before retiring and later joining the WWE. Rousey had previously dominated her opponents until the defeat by Holm. During her 14-fight career, she earned nine armbar stoppages, with 11 of her wins coming in the first round as she deliberately pressured opponents to limit damage received. \"When I came into MMA I couldn't take any hits so I had to develop a style of fighting that I believe is the most efficient that's ever been made with the express objective of avoiding damage,\" she said. \"It forced me to be really quick and efficient and try to finish off people very quickly. It wasn't an accident or luck, it was something I was doing very much on purpose.\" Rousey paused with a solemn expression before adding: \"Now removed from it, I can be proud of myself and be like no-one could even get close to me until it got to the point where even being touched put me out. \"Even though it feels like everyone will always define me by my failures, I know I created the most efficient fighting style that ever existed and I'm proud of that.\" Athletes, across a wide variety of sports, are more aware of the risks concussion poses than previously. Chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) is a brain condition linked to repeated blows to the head and concussion. The condition, which gradually gets worse over time and leads to dementia, can only be diagnosed by a post-mortem examination. Only 45 cases of CTE were confirmed worldwide in 2007, and now more than 10,000 people have taken part in studies. Earlier this week, Manchester United defender Raphael Varane also called for greater protection and better awareness around concussion. Rousey kept the severity of the injuries to herself and has chosen to open up about them now, fearing the UFC and later the WWE would prevent her from competing for her safety. Before debuting in the WWE in 2018, Rousey described her relief, detailing how she cried when doctors told her she had a \"pristine brain\" following an MRI scan. \"They were shocked, like, 'oh my god we were expecting this to be a hot mess but your brain is pristine',\" added Rousey.  \"I stopped crying whenever I lost my phone after that because before I was like, 'the CTE is coming for me'. \"It was weighing on me a lot before I got checked out. I worry because there is both Alzheimer's and dementia in my family and these are from family members who weren't taking a bunch of hits to the head for a few years.\""

        "text": " When Brendan Loughnane was knocked out by Jesus Pinedo 10 months ago, it left the Manchester fighter with a strange feeling. During the first round of his featherweight contest with Peru's Pinedo, Loughnane was dropped by a knee strike, ending his dream of defending the Professional Fighters League championship he won in 2022. It was the first time the 34-year-old had been stopped in his 32-fight career. \"It was really hard. Really hard. And it was also really foreign to me. I've never experienced anything like that and I've done a lot within the sport,\" Loughnane told BBC Sport. \"It's a very surreal feeling, very weird and strange, I can't really explain it. I've been hurt a few times, don't get me wrong, but never like that.\" It was not until five months later that Loughnane would start to feel like his old self again, and it came at the hands of Conor McGregor during a training session in Dubai. \"It took me a while to get over it and the reason I did get over it was when I started sparring McGregor, and we started sparring hard,\" said Loughnane. \"And then I realised, 'Oh, the chin still does work. Great! Let's go'.\" On Friday at the Wintrust Arena in Chicago, Loughnane starts his quest to reclaim the PFL featherweight title when he faces Portugal's Pedro Carvalho - a training partner of McGregor in Dublin - in his season opener. \"He's a great guy [McGregor], I loved the rounds. And I'm actually fighting one of his teammates in this fight. So I don't know, I'll be looking forward to getting this fight over with,\" said Loughnane.  \"I really enjoyed the training and I'm sure he did and I'd love to get some rounds in again.\" Victory would put Loughnane in a strong position to qualify from his group for the play-offs, before the PFL Finals at the end of the year. The seasonal format of the PFL means fighters can compete up to four times in seven months should they reach the finals, as a victorious Loughnane did in 2022. Defeat to eventual 2023 champion Pinedo, who Loughnane gives full credit to - \"he caught me fair and square\" - meant he was afforded some much needed time off. \"It's been such a hard couple of years for me in this thing. That 10 months since my last fight has been so productive for me,\" said Loughnane.  \"It's turned me into a better person, a better fighter. I'm looking forward to showing everyone on Friday night.\" Carvalho, 28, is competing in the PFL for the first time after the organisation acquired his former promotion Bellator in November. Loughnane started to train for the fight against Carvalho on Boxing Day after flying to Thailand from Manchester on Christmas Day. \"I had a promise to my mum that I'd spend Christmas Day with her because I haven't done for a while,\" said Loughnane.  \"I had Christmas dinner with my mum and I flew at 8.40pm that night. I'm in the last half of my career and I'd rather make the most of it and get as many fights in as possible. \"And if that means moving around on Christmas Day that means moving around on Christmas Day. I've got to keep promises, but I've also got to keep promises to myself.\""

        "text": " Alex Pereira knocked out Jamahal Hill in the first round to retain his light-heavyweight title at the landmark UFC 300 event in Las Vegas. Brazil's Pereira, 36, dropped American Hill, 32, with a left hook before finishing the fight with repeated ground strikes. Pereira has now won seven of his eight UFC bouts in a remarkable two and a half years. \"When I step into the octagon I don't see myself as champion,\" said Pereira. \"I do the same thing in my personal life. I don't let this belt go to my head ever.\" Max Holloway delivered the moment of the night at the T-Mobile Arena as he stopped fellow American Justin Gaethje in the final seconds of the pair's lightweight bout for the symbolic BMF title. Holloway, 32, pointed to the ground with 10 seconds to go, inviting Gaethje to stand and trade punches, before knocking him out with one second remaining as the pair swung wildly. Holloway delivers 'KO of the century' In the co-main event, Zhang Weili retained her strawweight title by unanimous decision against compatriot Yan Xiaonan in the UFC's first all-Chinese championship bout. Following the event, the UFC announced Ireland's Conor McGregor would fight for the first time since July 2021 when he takes on American Michael Chandler at UFC 303 in Las Vegas on 29 June. The landmark 300 event boasted a strong card top to bottom, with 12 current or former champions in action, including two in the first fight of the night in former flyweight champion Deiveson Figueiredo, who beat former title holder Cody Garbrandt by submission in the second round. The UFC's efforts in producing a star-studded show are synonymous with past centenary events, with WWE star Brock Lesnar fighting at both, while McGregor and Jon Jones were in contention to appear at UFC 200 before their bouts were cancelled. The headlining bout between Pereira and Hill was finalised following weeks of negotiations between the UFC and various fighters which did not come to fruition, including Leon Edwards, Israel Adesanya and Dricus du Plessis. But former middleweight champion Pereira was granted the prestigious headlining slot against Hill and he once again made the most of his opportunity in the spotlight. Pereira beat Jiri Prochazka in November to become only the ninth fighter to win titles in two weight classes in the UFC, and he achieved that feat in record-breaking time - seven fights. Hill, meanwhile, was fighting for the first time in 14 months after recovering from a ruptured Achilles sustained in July which forced him to vacate the title. After the pair traded leg kicks in the opening stages, Pereira started to come forward, applying pressure to Hill. With Hill retreating, Pereira then dropped the challenger with a left hook before delivering repeated blows on the canvas, forcing the referee to halt the contest. Following his victory, Pereira hinted at a move up to heavyweight and an attempt to become the UFC's first three-division champion. \"I want to keep continuing defending this belt, and I know there needs to be a lot promotion around this fight, but I want a fight at heavyweight,\" he said. UFC president Dana White announced in Thursday's press conference that fighters would be awarded $300,000 (\u00c2\u00a3239,000) performance and fight-of-the-night bonuses at the event, up from the standard $50,000 prize. And Holloway, stepping up to lightweight from featherweight to contest for Gaethje's BMF title, delivered a moment befitting of the prize. After largely outclassing the 35-year-old over five rounds and heading for a decision win, Holloway risked defeat by inviting Gaethje to stand and trade punches with 10 seconds remaining. But, with the final bell looming, Holloway cemented victory, connecting with a right hook which sent Gaethje crumbling to the canvas and wowing the sell-out crowd. Former heavyweight champion Mark Coleman, who was treated in hospital last month after saving his parents from a house fire, then wrapped the commemorative belt around Holloway, awarded to the UFC's 'baddest' fighter. \"Give it up to Gaethje - he's the real BMF. He had so much to lose and nothing to gain from this fight,\" said Holloway. Double Olympic judo gold medallist Kayla Harrison was victorious on her UFC debut as she dominated fellow American Holly Holm, forcing the former bantamweight champion to submit in the second round to a rear-naked choke. Former two-weight champion Amanda Nunes, who retired last year, then teased a potential return and match-up with Harrison by responding to footage of Harrison's post-fight interview on social media., external"

        "text": " All it takes is one moment of brilliance to steal the entire show. With a total of 12 current or former champions fighting at the landmark UFC 300 event in Las Vegas, it was going to take something extraordinary to stand out, but Max Holloway rose to the challenge. With only 10 seconds remaining of his lightweight contest with Justin Gaethje for the symbolic BMF title, Holloway pointed to the floor, inviting his American compatriot to stand and trade blows. With the pair swinging wildly, burning the final remnants of their energy following a gruelling five rounds, it was Holloway who connected hardest, sending Gaethje crumbling to the canvas with one second remaining. The sold-out crowd at the T-Mobile Arena burst into a deafening roar, while TV cameras showed wowed expressions on the faces of fighters watching on at octagon-side. UFC commentator Joe Rogan described the finish as the \"KO of the century\", while the promotion's president Dana White likened it to a \"scene from a movie\". Pereira knocks out Hill to retain title McGregor-Chandler fight confirmed for June Holloway, 32, won the commemorative BMF title, awarded to the UFC's 'baddest' fighter, and the description could not be more apt considering Holloway, who was set to win the bout by decision, risked defeat in favour of entertaining the fans and chasing a knockout. \"When we were sat in a room and we came up with the idea of BMF, tonight is what that belt was built for,\" said White. \"There should be a picture of that fight in the dictionary when you look up BMF. It was incredible. That's why Max Holloway is beloved. \"Tonight was a career-defining moment for a guy who's already accomplished great things - one of, if not the, best featherweight ever.\" The footage of the knockout already has more than 10 million views on social media, with the UFC capitalising on its popularity by sharing the video worldwide - something the promotion rarely does following pay-per-view events because of broadcasting contracts. Holloway's exploits also earned him $600,000 (\u00c2\u00a3481,000), with the Hawaii fighter earning the performance and fight of the night bonuses. Despite the acclaim, Holloway says the knockout ranks as the second-best moment of his career, behind his win over Brazil's Jose Aldo in 2017 for the featherweight title. In victory, Holloway, nicknamed Blessed, extends his UFC record to 22 wins from 29 fights across 12 years in the promotion. \"This is what the BMF is known for, but first of all I want to change the name to Blessed Man Forever,\" said Holloway. \"If that's not a BMF moment I don't know what is. This is the type of stuff you do to etch your name in the history book.\" Holloway said he has \"a number of options on the table\" following the win over Gaethje, but he is targeting a match-up with featherweight champion Ilia Topuria. \"It looks like El Matador is doing everything he can to escape the bull in the pen, but first things first - rest,\" said Holloway. \"I got my beautiful wife, beautiful family here. We'll just chill, brother.\""

        "text": " As part of a new series titled Fight Night, BBC Sport shines a light on MMA promotions across the UK and Europe, their fighters and the characteristics which make each one unique. Kicking off the series is a night at cageside with Oktagon MMA, a European promotion staging 1m euro tournaments and convincing fighters to fly across the globe to fight under their banner. A dancing monkey mascot stops to take a selfie with some children, while yellow and white spotlights illuminate about 3,000 fans singing karaoke inside the Utilita Arena in Newcastle. It is party time between bouts at Oktagon's second show in Britain, but things are about to get serious. The crowd noise quietens as the lights dim, and a video comes on the big screens promoting the next fight. In one corner is American flyweight Christopher Daniel. The 33-year-old, who is competing abroad for the first time, tells BBC Sport that although the show represents the biggest payday of his career he is fighting for a far bigger cause. After coming home one evening from his shift as a mechanic in 2015, Daniel found his five-year-old son Jayden had fallen into the swimming pool in his backyard and drowned. Daniel's mother, who was babysitting, had fallen asleep, allowing Jayden to wander off unsupervised. \"My mum always used to watch my kids when I went to work, but she worked a full-time job being a nurse, and being a nurse is stressful,\" said Daniel. \"My fear sank when I came home and saw the back door was open. I ran to the backyard and just saw him floating there. I jumped in and pulled him out but unfortunately at that time I didn't know CPR.\" Daniel was overcome by depression while resenting himself and his mother, but a promise he made to Jayden shortly before his death inspired forgiveness and a new purpose. While watching UFC with Jayden one night, Daniel had promised his son he would one day see him fight on television. Now Daniel fights to preserve that promise. \"I have a way bigger reason to fight. More than money, more than fame. I made a promise and that promise keeps me alive each and every single day,\" said Daniel. UFC star squares faith with a career in the octagon Aby to fight Creasey for Oktagon flyweight title UFC fighter gets tattoo of opponent's bite mark In the opposite corner is Welshman Aaron Aby, whose team hold a banner up behind him reading \"Cystic fibrosis - fighting to breathe\". Aby, 33, was born with the disorder which affects the lungs and digestive system, while in 2019 he also overcame stage three testicular cancer. The bout between Aby and Daniel is an illustration of why Oktagon, whose shows have attracted attendances of about 20,000 in the Czech Republic and Slovakia, believe they can succeed in the British MMA market. Their vision is grounded in promoting fighters who have distinctive back stories which an audience can invest in. \"It doesn't matter if you're Slovak, German, Czech or English - we are all human and we like stories since we are small kids,\" Oktagon co-founder Pavol Neruda tells BBC Sport. \"We want to bring stories, the human side of the sport, not promote blood and strong punches when someone is knocked out.  \"We want to promote [that] it's good to achieve your goals and be healthy and work towards something.\" Familiar faces sprinkle stardust on the show in Newcastle, such as British UFC stars Paddy Pimblett and Lerone Murphy, who are there in support of team-mates, experienced referee Mark Goddard, and reality TV personalities from British series Geordie Shore. Oktagon is also innovative, implementing open scoring between rounds, which is rarely seen in MMA. The judges' scores appear on the big screens, letting the audience, fighters and coaches know who is winning and losing each fight. It provides transparency, but has split fighters' opinion as some feel it may take away from the excitement and anticipation in tight contests. Neruda co-founded Oktagon alongside Ondrej Novotny in 2016, launching the promotion as a reality television show, akin to the UFC's The Ultimate Fighter as a soft introduction to the sport for the general public in the Czech Republic and Slovakia. The promotion gained popularity, and began hosting tournaments worth 1m euros (\u00c2\u00a3854,000), before expanding to Germany last year, where 19,000 fans attended a show in Cologne. The January show in Newcastle represents Oktagon's ambition to attract fans in Britain, with the promotion holding its debut UK show in Manchester two months earlier. But there were large pockets of empty seats at the Utilita Arena as Aby beat Daniel by unanimous decision, proving Oktagon still has work to do to attract UK fans. It is a challenge the promotion's owners are relishing, however. \"Our dream is to be the European MMA Champions League, but we knew before we came here it would be like this. We are prepared to bleed here until we win,\" said Novotny. \"This is our passion and I believe that one day we will fill this arena. We are looking to do crazy stuff here, we will try and try and try, and maybe it will come, or we will die.\" DI Humphrey Goodman meets Shipton Abbott: The hit spin-off from Death in Paradise returns!

        "description": "For AJ McKee, 2024 holds special significance. He is making it his \"Kobe Year\".",
        "text": " For AJ McKee, 2024 holds special significance. He is making it his \"Kobe Year\". The American has decided to do this in honour of NBA legend Kobe Bryant, who wore the number 24 jersey for the latter half of his iconic stint with the Los Angeles Lakers. Former Bellator featherweight champion McKee, 28, is taking inspiration from Bryant, widely regarded as one of the best basketball players of all time, as he enters a new chapter in his career. McKee has spent his entire 22-fight career with Bellator but is now set to fight under new ownership for the first time after the promotion was acquired by the PFL in November - and wants a little of Bryant's magic to rub off on him. On Saturday at the Kingdom Arena in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, McKee will face American lightweight Clay Collard in the PFL v Bellator champions event. \"It is a little chip on the Bellator fighters shoulders. We can't come in stomping our feet around. It's really coming in respectfully and letting our arts and crafts do the talking for us,\" said McKee. \"It's like any king and any kingdom. Once you have your land you've conquered, you look to go and conquer new lands and battle on new lands, so for me it's showing him: I'm here to take over your land. \"It's 2024, the year of Kobe for me. Rest in peace. This is me giving it my all this entire year.\" The event features two champion versus champion bouts with the PFL's Impa Kasanganay facing Bellator's Johnny Eblen at middleweight, and a heavyweight clash between the PFL's Renan Ferreira and Bellator's Ryan Bader.  Other fights include multi-weight boxing champion Claressa Shields taking on Kelsey DeSantis - the first professional women's MMA bout in Saudi Arabia, according to the PFL - and Biaggio Ali Walsh, grandson of boxing icon Muhammad Ali, making his professional MMA debut against Emmanuel Palacio. The fight night is the first under joint PFL-Bellator branding and continues Saudi Arabia's investment in sport, although the country has long been criticised for using sport to deflect conversation away from its poor human rights record. McKee, nicknamed 'The Mercenary', won a record 21 Bellator fights after making his debut in 2015, with his sole defeat coming against Patricio 'Pitbull' Freire in 2022, when he lost the featherweight title. McKee's performances and loyalty to Bellator made him the face of the promotion and one of its most marketable assets. \"Bellator is my home. It's where I started. It's where The Mercenary was born,\" said McKee.  \"He wasn't a contract killer at first; he was just a young guy trying to fight everybody and beat everybody up. Now I can say I've established the full arsenal.  \"Bellator stuck by my side from the jump, watched me and kind of groomed me into becoming the athlete I am today. I have nothing but love for Bellator.\" McKee fought the entirety of his Bellator career at featherweight until defeat by Freire, when he moved up to lightweight and embarked on a three-fight win streak. The PFL's deal to acquire Bellator leaves McKee's career at a fork in the road - he can continue under the Bellator branding, where matchmakers set up fights in the traditional manner, or he can switch to the PFL's seasonal league format. McKee says he is \"uncertain\" of the direction he will take after fighting Collard, but has a number of options. \"This is my opportunity and I can kind of do whatever I want now, it's just a matter of 'what do you want to do AJ?'\" said McKee. \"If it's at 155lb [lightweight], I wouldn't mind doing a PFL tournament. \"If it's at 145lb [featherweight], I wouldn't mind doing one off big fights, and then also going for that 145lb title, whether it's Bellator or PFL. I've always said I'm the best 145lb pounder in the world.\" Whatever McKee decides to do, while drawing on inspiration from Bryant, becoming a champion once again is his priority. \"I wouldn't say my long-term goals have changed much. Predominantly it's just getting that belt wrapped around my waist again - I've missed being champion,\" said McKee. \"That's been my dream since I was a kid. I've worked day in day out for to be a champion and be notified as the best in the world.\""

        "text": " Manchester's Brendan Loughnane returned to winning ways with victory over Pedro Carvalho at PFL 3 on Friday in Chicago. Loughnane, 34, had not fought since his shock defeat by Jesus Pinedo in June. A crunching right hand was the start of Carvalho's downfall, before the referee stepped in to halt the contest after just 86 seconds. The win marks Loughnane's 29th victory of his career and gives him six points in his first fight of the Professional Fighters League's (PFL) 2024 season. Loughnane is a former PFL featherweight champion, winning the 2022 tournament and making history as the PFL's first English champion. But his dream of defending the title was taken away in 2023 as Peru's Pinedo handed him his first knockout loss in 32 fights. Loughnane took 10 months out to recover, only rediscovering his confidence in a sparring session with former UFC champion Conor McGregor. And on Friday night, Loughnane showed no signs of uncertainty in the cage, engaging with Carvalho in the opening 10 seconds and landing a sharp right after catching a kick from his opponent. Nurmagomedov voted UFC GOAT Aspinall 'confirmed' for UFC Manchester fight Carvalho spent most of the fight trying to withstand pressure from Loughnane and was dropped by a short right hand. Loughnane moved forward to finish the fight but struggled to land cleanly on a squirming Carvalho. The Portuguese dived for Loughnane's leg but referee Kevin MacDonald decided to stop the contest.  Carvalho, 28, slumped to his third defeat in a row.  While there was good news for Loughnane, it was a difficult night for Welshman Brett Johns. The 32-year-old featherweight was beaten via unanimous decision by Russian Timur Khizriev, picking up the fourth loss of his 24-fight MMA career. Khizriev, 28, remains unbeaten with 15 victories in a row, while Johns will need to pick himself up quickly for his next fight in the summer. \"Not the result we wanted for Brett Johns, but the man fought his heart out against an unbeaten talent and left it all on there,\" John's coach Richard Shore said afterwards. \"We are proud of him and 28 June we will go again.\" PFL's season format means each fighter competes twice for points in two fights before moving on to the knockout stages and the finals at the end of the year. The winner of each tournament wins $1m with the PFL world title."

        "description": "Venue: ",
        "text": " \"When I came back from training, I couldn't stop seeing images of the fire, of people dying ... I cried every single day for the first month.\" Ilima-Lei Macfarlane was sitting on her sofa beside her partner in tears when Bellator told her they were about to announce the biggest fight of her career. On Saturday in San Diego, Macfarlane fights her long-time friend and flyweight champion Liz Carmouche at Bellator 300.  It is a landmark event for Bellator and perhaps one of the final fights of Macfarlane's history-making career. But for Macfarlane, 9 August was also one of the most difficult days of her life. A Hawaii native, Macfarlane had spent all day trying to contact friends back home in Maui, where wildfires were raging through the land. Entire areas were wiped out in Maui, including the town of Lahaina. The death toll stands at 97 people. Macfarlane was watching the devastation unfold on TV.  She had been in Maui some 72 hours beforehand and had been in the airport when Bellator told her she would be fighting champion Carmouche. She returned to San Diego to begin her camp. \"When I woke up I saw tons and tons of text messages from my family,\" she says. \"I looked on my phone and saw just how devastating the fires are.  \"I instantly tried messaging my girl friend [who lives in Maui] and she's not answering so I'm freaking out.  \"I have to go to practice, I have to go train. When I came back from training, I couldn't stop seeing images of the fire, of people dying. It was crazy.\" Bellator went ahead with the announcement, but Macfarlane decided to use the moment as a tool to help her homeland.  Best friends become foes for Bellator title fight Northern Ireland's McCourt aims to reignite hopes of title fight The 33-year-old has built a life outside of the cage advocating for the rights of indigenous women and raising awareness about the plight facing many Hawaiians. \"In that moment, when Bellator announced the fight, I also made a video and I was like 'yes we just announced this fight and it should be one of the happiest days of my life, but I can't be happy right now because my home is burning'.  \"I made that video, it was very raw, very emotional, I was crying in it. I posted it and it kind of went viral overnight.\" Macfarlane would raise more than \u00c2\u00a32.1m for victims of the fire through Instagram.  The funds were only be released this week due to Instagram's owners Meta and their non-profit partner Network for Good's policy of holding the money for a certain period of time.  Macfarlane's bank then also took time to release the money. \"It ended up reaching a million dollars in 48 hours,\" Macfarlane said. \"This wasn't big donors, big organisations or corporations or anything.  \"It was actually just the people sending $5 here, sending $10 there. It was the people that raised this money and it's for the people of Maui.  \"I'm a very small non-profit. I actually do this entirely voluntarily. I don't make any money from my non-profit.  \"This is what I do on the side of my fighting career and running the gym business. I was like 'oh my gosh, I've never had to handle so much money before. What do I do?' \"It was pretty chaotic those first couple of weeks just trying to get everything in order.\" While training for her fight, MacFarlane organised several donation drives, kept track of all the money that went to victims in Hawaii, made countless media appearances and fundraised at charity events across San Diego.  Her own family lost a distant cousin to the fire. \"I cried every single day for the first month,\" she says. \"While this camp wasn't the most ideal in terms of how much focus I put towards it, it's okay.  \"This is the fight I wanted. This is what I wanted.\" On the eve of the fight, Macfarlane missed weight and is now unable to win the flyweight belt.  But once the bout is over, Macfarlane will fly to Maui and begin to properly distribute all the money she has raised.  With a massive rebuild under way in Maui, MacFarlane is hopeful Hawaiians will be at the front of decision making.  Hawaiians say the fires were in part caused by a long-running water diversion dispute, external on the island, that dates back to when pineapple and sugar plantations were first established in the mid-1800s. \"This was definitely an avoidable tragedy had we been able to sustain Lahaina using Hawaiians' traditional agricultural and water flow practices,\" Macfarlane says. \"Hawaiians are some of the smartest people in the world and to not listen to them in their own home, in the land that they have cultivated for generations and generations - you have tragedies like this.  \"The shirt I'm wearing,'Keep Lahaina lands in Lahaina hands', the rebuild of Lahaina 100% needs to be led by the people of Lahaina and the generational families and voices of Lahaina because they know what's best for Lahaina.\" With retirement potentially looming for Macfarlane and the chance to regain the flyweight title she lost in 2020 now gone, she has no regrets about her choices in this camp. \"I'm dedicating this fight to Maui and to the deeper causes,\" she says. \"I've been toying with the idea of potentially retiring soon.  \"This fight chapter is coming to a close [but I will be] continuing this fight outside of the cage.  \"If this wasn't like a bigger sign from the universe that this is what I'm supposed to be doing, then I don't know what is.  \"So of course I'm fighting for a bigger cause.\" Fancy a tea break with David Brent?

        "text": " The Pittsburgh Steelers have signed former Super Bowl-winning quarterback Russell Wilson on a one-year contract. The 35-year-old was a free agent as the Denver Broncos released him just two years after signing him in one of the most valuable trades in NFL history. The Steelers then agreed to trade Kenny Pickett to the Philadelphia Eagles. \"I was fortunate to have several teams call, but this is where I wanted to be,\" said Wilson of Pittsburgh, who have won a joint-record six NFL titles. \"To be a Pittsburgh Steeler, to wear the black and gold - it's a true honour. The tradition, the history. There's six [Super Bowl] trophies in there. We've got to go get a seventh.\" In a 10-year stint with the Seattle Seahawks, Wilson won the Super Bowl against Denver in 2014 and is one of just five active QBs to have started and won the NFL's championship game, the others being Patrick Mahomes, Matthew Stafford, Aaron Rodgers and Joe Flacco. Denver traded two first-round draft picks, two second-round picks, a fifth-round pick and three players to Seattle in exchange for Wilson and a fourth-round pick before the start of the 2022 season. He then signed a five-year contract extension worth $245m, external to 2029. Wilson was touted as the long-term successor to legendary quarterback Peyton Manning, who retired after the Broncos clinched their third Super Bowl in 2016, but he won just 11 of his 30 games with Denver. All-time defensive great Donald retires from NFL Jason Kelce confirms retirement after 13 seasons with Philadelphia Eagles He had two head coaches in two years with the Broncos, with rookie Nathaniel Hackett sacked late into his first season, while his successor Sean Payton benched him for the final two games of the 2023 season.  Wilson has 43,653 passing yards, 334 touchdowns and 106 interceptions across his 12-year career and was expected to compete with Kenny Pickett. He had been Pittsburgh's starting quarterback since they selected him in the first round of the 2022 draft, shortly after their two-time Super Bowl winner Ben Roethlisberger brought his 18-year career to a close. However, after securing the Wilson deal, the Steelers agreed to trade the 25-year-old to the Eagles. With so much of Wilson's huge contract extension having been guaranteed ($165m), Denver will still pay most of his salary for the 2024 season, with Pittsburgh paying a fraction. Phoebe Schecter, NFL pundit Wilson really struggled the past two years with the Broncos. He did improve with Payton in his second year but it's not the same old Russell Wilson. They brought Payton in and, truthfully, he never really wanted Wilson. He wanted to find his players to bring in, so I think that was the biggest issue there. This is almost a 'no-brainer' for the Steelers, paying that little money for a starting quarterback, for a veteran, who was in the league last year."

Rees-Zammit, who was part of the 2024 international player pathway (IPP), joins the Chiefs just 10 weeks after quitting Welsh rugby on the eve of this year's Six Nations tournament. In a video posted on X, Rees-Zammit said he \"can't wait\" to see Chiefs fans at the team's Arrowhead Stadium.

He has also been given a guaranteed salary in addition to a signing bonus. He has targeted a hybrid role playing at both wide receiver and running back, and his next task will be to try to earn a regular-season roster spot. He was one of 16 players to take part in the 2024 IPP, a 10-week crash course designed to teach the required skills to succeed in the NFL. The ex-Gloucester player - who has won 32 caps for Wales, scoring 14 tries - showcased his skills at University of South Florida's Pro Day earlier this month, with scouts from all 32 NFL teams in attendance.

NFL rule changes have been implemented to encourage teams to return a greater number of kick-offs, an area where the Chiefs could look to use him. He has previously said he \"would love\" to return kicks on special teams, and his size, strength, speed and agility are attributes teams look for at the position.

        "text": " The NFL was back with a bang this week as its 32 teams started shaping their rosters for the 2024 season. Just over four weeks after the Kansas City Chiefs won their third Super Bowl in five years, the new league year officially got under way. It begins with the free agency period and this year it was a busy week, with more than 100 deals being agreed. Pittsburgh signing quarterbacks Russell Wilson and Justin Fields were the most high-profile moves but here are more of the biggest deals. Kirk Cousins has had to bide his time before becoming one of the NFL's top quarterbacks. An afterthought of a draft pick by Washington in 2012, he did not become their starter until his fourth year. After moving to Minnesota in 2018, he established himself as one of the NFL's most consistent passers, albeit more functional than flashy. Yet over the last couple of years, the seemingly strait-laced family man has also become an unlikely fans' favourite. Cousins was the star of the Quarterback series on Netflix, which followed him, Patrick Mahomes and Marcus Mariota during the 2022 season. And after a big away win, Cousins celebrated by going shirtless on the Vikings' flight home, dancing while covered in bling. Injury ended his 2023 season but the 35-year-old has now been lured to Atlanta with the biggest contract of his career - a four-year deal worth $180m (\u00c2\u00a3141m). He will lead a vibrant young offence while last year's starter Desmond Ridder is heading to Arizona. While Patrick Mahomes again produced when it matters most for Kansas City, last season's Super Bowl run was actually built on the Chiefs' defence. Chris Jones is its leader, playing throughout the team's dynasty, and they recognised his importance by handing the 29-year-old a record deal for a defensive tackle - $158.75m (\u00c2\u00a3124.7m) over five years. Rams defensive star Aaron Donald announces retirement After their Super Bowl epic in 2023, Philadelphia were on course for a rematch with Kansas City before suffering a late-season slump. Veteran centre Jason Kelce then retired but the Eagles have given themselves a boost by adding one of the NFL's best running backs to a team that already tends to have one of the league's best offensive lines and running games. Nicknamed 'Saquad' for the size of his thighs, Barkley was 2018's Offensive Rookie of the Year and has shown signs of getting back to his best over the last couple of seasons. He's been one of the Giants' few playmakers over the last six years so it was a surprise they let him go when he's still only 27. Barkley joins their divisional rivals on a three-year, $37.8m deal, while D'Andre Swift has left Philly for Chicago. \"I'm pretty positive, even though a little bit upset [the Eagles] waited until I retired to make a move like this,\" Kelce said on his podcast. \"I knew I was going to miss an outstanding season for the Eagles, but I get to watch it and celebrate it just like everybody else, so I'm excited for that.\" A battering ram of a running back, Derrick Henry has been the NFL's best since coming into the league in 2016, being named 2020's Offensive Player of the Year. But Tennessee are in the midst of a rebuild and running backs are thought to be in decline once they turn 30, as Henry did in January. Baltimore, though, felt the opportunity to sign a player who has been such a dominant force was too good to pass up. \"He's kind of a unicorn,\" said Ravens general manager Eric DeCosta. \"It's a combination of speed, power, durability. Those kind of guys are rare.\" Henry joins a team that had the NFL's best record in the regular season and will allow mobile quarterback Lamar Jackson, named Most Valuable Player for a second time, to save his legs for when he really needs to conjure some magic. After arriving on a two-year, $16m contract, Henry had a clear message for his doubters: \"Tell them to keep watching\". That Tennessee rebuild has seen the Titans sign running back Tony Pollard from Dallas to replace Henry, while adding quarterback Mason Rudolph from Pittsburgh. But their biggest deal was bringing in wide receiver Calvin Ridley, 29, from Jacksonville on a four-year, $92 contract. Another team in a rebuild is Washington and they have added a defensive leader in 33-year-old linebacker Bobby Wagner, who led the league for tackles last season. They brought in quarterback Marcus Mariota so let last season's starter Sam Howell join Seattle, and are expected to draft another QB with the second overall pick. They have also added pedigree to their offence with running back Austin Ekeler and tight end Zach Ertz. After playing for three teams in a year, Tampa Bay gave Baker Mayfield, 28, a chance to revive his career last season and he took advantage by leading them to the play-offs. They have rewarded 2018's number one draft pick with a three-year contract worth $100m and re-signed star receiver Mike Evans too. Las Vegas have bolstered their hard-nosed defence by signing tackle Christian Wilkins on a four-year, $110m deal. They have also brought in quarterback Gardner Minshew from Indianapolis so let Jimmy Garoppolo join the Los Angeles Rams. The Green Bay Packers made a surprise move by signing Josh Jacobs from the Raiders and letting fellow running back Aaron Jones join divisional rivals Minnesota, who have also brought in quarterback Sam Darnold from San Francisco to help replace Kirk Cousins. Last season showed the value in having reliable cover at quarterback, with more than 60 used as starters due to inconsistent form and injuries.  Teams have been shuffling their pack before the draft (25-27 April), bringing in guys to compete for the starters' job or serve as back-ups, with some of those mentioned above involved in a quarterback merry-go-round. Other notable names on the move are Jameis Winston to Cleveland, Joe Flacco to Indianapolis, Jacoby Brissett to New England, Mac Jones to Jacksonville, Drew Lock to the Giants and Tyrod Taylor to the Jets.

        "text": " Former Detroit Lions player Cameron Sutton has handed himself in to Florida police to face domestic violence allegations, more than three weeks after an arrest warrant was issued. ESPN reported the warrant was issued on 7 March and police asked for public help to trace Sutton on 20 March. On Sunday, the Hillsborough County Sheriff's Office (HCSO) in Tampa said it had taken Sutton, 29, into custody. Sutton faces allegations of domestic battery by strangulation. The Lions released the defensive back, external on 21 March after the police appeal. His attorney said his client was going to hand himself in to authorities in Tampa on 25 March, but he did not report to Orient Road Jail until 8:24pm local time on Sunday, the HSCO said in a statement. \"After weeks of evading law enforcement, this man has finally made the right choice to turn himself in,\" said Sheriff Chad Chronister. \"Domestic violence has no place in our community, and no one is above the law here in Hillsborough County. My thoughts are with this woman as she continues to heal from this man's gruesome actions.\" Domestic battery by strangulation is classed as a third-degree offence and carries a punishment of up to five years in prison. The Lions signed Sutton on a $33m (\u00c2\u00a326.1m) three-year contract from the Pittsburgh Steelers in 2023 and he started all 17 regular-season games as well as three play-off games last season.

The Kansas City Chiefs - who have won three of the past five Super Bowl titles - are among the latest to take an interest in the Welshman. Led by quarterback Patrick Mahomes, the Chiefs defeated the San Francisco 49ers 25-22 in February to become the first side to retain the Super Bowl since the New England Patriots almost two decades ago (2004 and 2005). The Broncos finished third in the AFC West last season - two spots below the Chiefs - with a record of eight wins and nine losses during the regular season."

        "text": " Taylor Swift is proving to be American football's gift that keeps on giving. The global superstar's relationship with Kansas City Chiefs star Travis Kelce lured scores of new fans to the USA's National Football League last season. Her presence at the Chiefs' Super Bowl win in February helped make it the most watched ever, with a record number of female viewers., external From the UK to Australia, the American singer-songwriter is not just bringing new spectators to the sport, she is inspiring young girls to play it too. And that is helping one of the world's fastest growing sports - flag football - grow even faster before making its Olympic debut. After a failed attempt at inclusion for Tokyo 2020, the International Federation of American Football (Ifaf) agreed a partnership with the NFL, targeting Los Angeles 2028. In 2017 the NFL launched its own programme, external for flag football, the non-contact version of the game, and last October it was one of five sports added to the Olympic programme for 2028. \"It's really special for a lot of young people, that they now can play at the pinnacle of sport and represent their country in flag football,\" former Great Britain player Afia Law, now NFL Flag's international development manager, told BBC Sport.  Listen: Sportshour - How flag football became an Olympic sport Flag is the most inclusive and accessible form of American football. It is played by more than 20 million people, across more than 100 countries, and the rapid growth of the women's game was key to earning the Olympic vote. \"Female participation has really been the driving force,\" said NFL analyst Phoebe Schecter, who has also played both flag and tackle football for Great Britain.  \"People used to say that flag was a female sport whereas men would play tackle, but it's for everyone now. People see how explosive it is, the incredible contested catches, and it doesn't matter what your gender is, this is a place where you can just compete and have a great time.\" Yet Great Britain's teams have not just been having a great time, they have been winning too. Schecter played on the women's team that became European champions last August, then helped coach the Under-17 girls as they also became European champions in September. There have been many obstacles for the current women's team. Kate Bruinvels had to set up a crowdfunding page, external to raise the \u00c2\u00a3750 she needed to compete in Ireland last summer. Meanwhile, after discovering flag football at primary school, Kellie Barrett and her family formed their own club - the Coventry Cougars - so that she and her sister could keep playing. But Loughborough College now offers 10 flag football scholarships for male and female athletes aged 16-19, and the British game is set for a funding boost before the World Championships in August, for which Great Britain's women and men have qualified. \"We've been successful without that help - how successful can we be with it?\" asked Britain captain Barrett. \"My hope is that we're going through this hardship now, whereas any girls just starting to play won't have that barrier. They won't have to take on any financial burden.\" The NFL Flag programme expanded in 2018 to the UK, where 500 schools and 30,000 players now participate in flag - 53% of them female. A girls league was also launched in London last year, expanding for its second season to 260 girls from 21 schools. And as well as going on to play for Britain, the most promising British youngsters can earn a free education through flag football, perhaps even a career. Flag is now a varsity sport in the US - for men and women - with college scholarships available for international student-athletes. A new professional men's league - the American Flag Football League, external - begins on 27 April, with a women's division set to launch in 2025. Even in Australia, many athletes are considering switching sports to flag football. One female ex-Australian Rules player has been offered a US scholarship after playing in just one international flag tournament. How did Taylor Swift's attendance influence the NFL's big game? Listen: Sportshour - Philadelphia Eagles' girls flag league and sports bra pledge \"I've got two little girls, aged seven and eight, who love the game now,\" said Gridiron Australia chief executive Wade Kelly. \"They love netball as well but now flag football's taking over. Taylor Swift maybe bumped that along a bit, but that's all they want to play now, down at the park or at the beach. \"As a dad, to know they can go and get an education that's paid for in the US, see the world, go to the Olympics, maybe even turn pro - it's a legitimate pathway for them, and a really exciting one.\" Flag football became an Olympic sport just three weeks after Taylor Swift attended her first Chiefs game. Since then, many UK flag teams such as the East Kilbride Pirates have reported a boom in awareness and interest, from newcomers and also from tackle players wanting to switch over. That isn't all down to the Taylor Swift effect, but there is no denying that it has reached far beyond the NFL arena. \"People, especially young girls, are now aware of the sport in a way they never have been before,\" said East Kilbride's club chair Amanda McDonald. \"It's amazing she's got people talking about it, which can only be good for the game and perhaps act as a gateway to get people involved who otherwise might not have. \"For the first time, there's a pathway all the way to the podium. We're about to start a new team for the 14-17 age group and, who knows, one of them could be a future Olympian.\" Get American Football alerts in the BBC Sport app"

        "text": " Down GAA goalkeeper Charlie Smyth has signed for the NFL's New Orleans Saints on a three-year contract. The 22-year-old will have the chance to fulfil his American football dream with the 2010 Super Bowl champions. Smyth joins the Saints as a kicker after impressing at trials and will aim to make the active roster. The Mayobridge goalkeeper has made his eye-catching move through the NFL's international player pathway (IPP) programme. New Orleans confirmed the deal for Smyth on Friday, as he swaps Gaelic football for American football. Tadhg Leader, who is a kicking coach for the IPP and was integral in bringing Smyth into the pathway programme, said he was \"lost for words\". \"I first met Charlie 6 months ago,\" Leader posted on X., external \"He and his family put their trust in me. Then we embarked on a journey into the unknown. Thanks to Charlie's talent and work ethic, we found a way.\" Leader added: \"He's rightly buzzing but already talking about training next week. Ireland couldn't have a better ambassador in Charlie.\" Paul Sheehy, president of the ProStar Sports Agency which acts for Smyth, posted on X, external that he was \"having a toast in the office to Charlie Smyth on his signing with the Saints\". The IPP is a 10-week crash course for international players designed to teach the required skills to succeed in the NFL. Smyth impressed scouts at the NFL Combine and pro-day trials, earning an invitation to the Saints' training facility. Smyth joined Monaghan goalkeeper Rory Beggan, Wicklow's Mark Jackson and former Connacht rugby player Darragh Leader at the NFL Combine in early March as the four players attempted to earn a contract as a kicker. Smyth, Beggan and Leader were then signed to American football agency ProStar Sports and took part in the pro-day trials in Florida, watched by NFL scouts. Down Under-20 Ulster Championship winner Smyth landed eight of his 10 kicks - including one from 60 yards. That showing led to interest from the Saints. Although he has now joined the Louisiana franchise, Smyth is not guaranteed time on the field. Over the summer he has the opportunity to compete with last season's kicker Blake Grupe. NFL franchises can have 90 players on their roster throughout the off-season and that number is cut to 53 right before the start of the regular season, which will be the team's active roster. Those who miss out are either released or retained on the practice squad, where players can still earn sizeable salaries and be promoted to the active roster during the course of the season. From the 2024 season, which begins in September, all 32 NFL teams can have an additional spot on their practice squad for international players, including those who have come through the IPP, which aims to discover new talent and expand American football's global reach. Wales rugby union star Louis Rees-Zammit, who has signed with Super Bowl champions the Kansas City Chiefs, is another high-profile name from this year's IPP programme. In January, Green Bay Packers punter Dan Whelan became the first Irish-born player to play in the NFL playoffs for 41 years."

        "text": " The NFL features more than 2,200 players across the league's 32 teams and most are recruited via the NFL Draft each April. Every year thousands of players in the US collegiate system become eligible for the draft but the total number of selections is limited to about 250. Although players who go undrafted can still be signed later, most future stars are picked up during the three-day event. But early draft picks can often flop in the NFL while some chosen late become greats - Tom Brady was selected 199th overall in 2000 yet went on to win a record seven Super Bowls. The draft is divided into seven rounds - the first taking place on a Thursday, rounds two and three on Friday and four to seven on Saturday. All 32 teams have one pick in each round, going in the reverse order of the previous season's standings - so the team with the worst record goes first and the Super Bowl winners last - but previous trades mean that is not strictly the case. Instead of paying transfer fees, NFL teams trade future draft picks to acquire players from other teams or move up in the draft. The Kansas City Chiefs, for example, traded away three picks in 2017 to climb into position to select current star Patrick Mahomes. And previous trades mean that the Chicago Bears have two picks in the first nine this year while the Cleveland Browns' first pick is the 54th overall. NFL teams scout players at college and then assess them during the NFL Combine, a week-long event in February featuring physical and mental tests where teams can also interview prospects. Each college/university holds a Pro Day, where draft hopefuls have another chance to showcase their skills, and they may also visit teams for more tests and interviews. Then comes the draft.  Each pick will not necessarily be the best player still available, they may be the player that team feels best suits their needs. This year 257 players will be selected. The figure varies each year as teams are awarded compensatory picks for players they lost in free agency and rewarded with picks for developing minority candidates for head coach/general manager positions, while teams may also have to forfeit picks for breaching NFL rules."

The 22-year-old, who has come from Gaelic football, secured a deal last week after impressing at trials. Smyth hopes to make the Saints' roster before the start of the 2024 NFL season in September. \"I feel like I've got the ability to kick in this league and to kick for the Saints,\" said the Down GAA goalkeeper. \"It's been an unbelievable journey just to get to this point, but now I know I'm in the league, the Saints have signed me, but now it's time to get to work. This is where the real work starts.\" As an Ulster Under-20 Championship winner with Down in 2021, Smyth had a bright future in Gaelic football, the sport he has played his entire life.  However, after deciding to pursue his dream of playing in the NFL, he started to train with Tadhg Leader, a kicking coach for the NFL international player pathway (IPP) programme.  Along with Rory Beggan, Wicklow's Mark Jackson and former Connacht rugby player Darragh Leader, Smyth attended the NFL Combine in Indianapolis in early March. Having impressed at the Combine and at pro-day trials, Mayobridge native Smyth was invited to the Saints' training facility before signing the contract. Over the summer, Smyth will compete with current Saints kicker Blake Grupe for the spot in the active roster.  Those who miss out on the 53-player active roster are either released or retained on the practice squad, where players can still earn sizeable salaries and be promoted to the active roster during the course of the season. However, while he concedes there is a lot of work to be done to make the Saints team, Smyth says he is determined to make the starting team and blaze a trail for Irish youngsters harbouring similar ambitions.  \"I want the starting job, that's why I'm here,\" said Smyth, who was speaking to American reporters remotely on Monday after returning home to Mayobridge last week.  \"I felt like this is a great opportunity to do that. I know obviously Blake Grupe is an unbelievable kicker of a football as well and I know it's going to be very difficult.\" Smyth, who is the first Irish player to sign with an NFL team via the IPP, added: \"But it's the mindset I have, I don't want to be one of those boys who comes through the IPP to sit on the practice squad for three years, earn a wee bit of money and then go back home.  \"That's not why I'm here. I want to do this because I want to play. We've played Gaelic football all our lives for no pay. We do it for the passion and that's what I'm doing.  \"For me, it's not about money, it's about being the best version of myself and representing my country on a world stage and inspiring younger lads to follow suit.\" Get American Football alerts in the BBC Sport app NFL fixtures and results | NFL tables"

My prayers to Vontae's family.\" The Dolphins, who drafted Davis as a first-round pick in 2009, said: \"We are heartbroken by the sudden passing of former Dolphins CB Vontae Davis and extend our deepest condolences to his family & loved ones during this difficult time.\" The Bills added: \"We are saddened to learn of the passing of Vontae Davis. We are thinking of his friends, family, and loved ones during this difficult time.\""

        "description": "Charlie Smyth's head was all over the place.",
        "text": " Charlie Smyth's head was all over the place. This was his big opportunity and the wait to find out if his dream had been realised or shattered was proving torturous. Life has moved really fast for Smyth over the past year. Hailing from the village of Mayobridge, Smyth was at one stage training to be a teacher and playing a bit of Gaelic football, the sport he has played all his life. But after deciding to pursue his dream of becoming an American footballer, Smyth found himself in New Orleans, 4,000 miles away from home and facing up to the biggest day of his young life. Having honed his skills as a kicker, 22-year-old Smyth did enough at the NFL Combine and International Player Pathway Pro Day to make the New Orleans Saints sit up and take notice. Smyth was invited to train with the Saints and showcase his kicking skills at the Saints' training facility under the watchful eye of head coach Dennis Allen among others. He kicked well. He missed a few, but nailed one from 61 yards and was generally happy enough with how he performed under pressure. After he was done kicking, he was told to grab a shower. \"I was thinking 'what's going to happen here?' - my head was absolutely scrambled,\" Smyth told The GAA Social. \"I didn't know what was happening, I was like 'am I getting a contract or not here?' because they talked about working with me in the future.\" Listen to Charlie Smyth on The GAA Social  'Real work starts now' - Smyth on Saints deal After a quick scrub, Smyth was told he was going to be taken upstairs. A good sign, he thought. He was right. Upstairs, he met the general manager Mickey Loomis and was offered a three-year contract. After going through the terms with his agent, Smyth signed and his life would never be the same again. Smyth hadn't kicked an American football before last August. Now he has a genuine shot at playing in the NFL. The last couple of weeks have been, by his own admission, \"absolutely insane\". \"It's just been unbelievable. The phone has been hopping with just the support from everyone back home has been unbelievable. \"I just feel very lucky and grateful.\" Lucky indeed. If Smyth makes the Saints' active roster, he could earn around $800,000 (\u00c2\u00a3630,680) a year. But coming from a GAA background, he's not one for getting bogged down in the big sums. Smyth knows that he's entered a cut-throat world, an environment in which his position is far from invulnerable. \"They can cut you anytime [from your contract],\" he explains. \"If you're on the practice squad, it's obviously different to what you'd be earning on the active roster. \"It's probably about four times that amount. For me, I know I'm talking about money here, but for me it really has nothing to do with that. \"Genuinely it's not, I've been a huge fan of the sport from about seven or eight years ago. For me it's all about making the best version of myself.\" Smyth, who revealed he was previously a Green Bay Packers fan, added: \"At the minute, I know it might sound all serious and all, but I do have a really tough job ahead of me. I feel like I've got the confidence that I can do it.\" For a young man who once excitedly slid into the DMs of the NFL UK's Instagram page asking how he could become an American footballer, Smyth seems like he has his head screwed on. He knows the road that lies ahead and the work that's required if he is to dislodge Blake Grupe - who he is yet to meet - as the Saints' kicker for the 2024 NFL season. \"I've been a huge fan of the NFL. I would watch it more than Gaelic football, to be honest, and soccer as well, and it's not really normal to follow it back home,\" Smyth said. \"It's maybe not something that motivates me but we probably are putting Gaelic football on the map. The number of people I've spoken to in the States who are like 'what's this Gaelic soccer, or football?'. We're creating awareness for it.\" The key question, of course, is: is Smyth good enough to make it? \"I feel like I am. I have a few adjustments to make but I definitely have the leg, the height on my kicks and the power and I feel like there's a few kickers who don't have that. \"If I can keep developing and taking on the tips from the coaches, I feel like I can be in the better half of the kickers in the league. The standard is so high, it's unbelievable.\""

        "text": " The Pittsburgh Steelers have traded for Chicago Bears quarterback Justin Fields - just a day after signing former Super Bowl winner Russell Wilson. After leaving Denver, Wilson, 35, was set to be Pittsburgh's new starter after they traded the incumbent Kenny Pickett to the Philadelphia Eagles. But now the Steelers have also brought in Fields, the Bears' starter since being a first-round draft pick in 2021. \"Ready for this next chapter,\" the 25-year-old said on X., external \"Can't say thank you enough to the city of Chicago for taking me in and embracing me.\" A mobile quarterback, Fields showed flashes of his athleticism during his first two years with Chicago, although some questioned whether he relied too much on his legs to escape pressure. After just three wins in 2022, Chicago had the first pick of last year's draft but kept faith in Fields by trading that pick to the Carolina Panthers for receiver DJ Moore and several draft picks. Those included Carolina's first-round pick this year, which turned out to be the first overall as the Panthers finished last season with the NFL's worst record. Meet Bears quarterback Justin Fields - the 'superstar' set to be future MVP? NFL free-agency: Cousins, Jones and Henry among biggest 2024 deals The Bears did improve to a 7-10 record and Fields leaned more on his passing game in 2023, throwing for 2,562 yards and 16 touchdowns, while his rushing yards almost halved from 1,143 to 657. But this time Chicago decided to move on from Fields - and that they could not pass up on that first overall pick a second time - especially with several quarterbacks being among the most highly-rated prospects in this year's draft class. \"Thank you to the entire Bears organisation and ownership for allowing me the opportunity to be part of such a historic franchise,\" Fields added. \"But most of all thank you to all my brothers that I played with. You all were the reason I attacked each day the way I did. I wish each one of you nothing but success.\" Pittsburgh, who have not had a losing season in 17 years under coach Mike Tomlin and were knocked out of the first round of last season's play-offs, have now overhauled their quarterback roster during free agency. As well as bringing in two of last season's starting quarterbacks, they have let go of Pickett and his back-ups Mitchell Trubisky (Buffalo Bills) and Mason Rudolph (Tennessee Titans), who both started games after Pickett suffered an ankle injury in December.

The 46-year-old former quarterback retired in 2022, reversing his decision only six weeks later in order to play a 23rd and final season in the NFL. While the record seven-time Super Bowl winner ruled out a full return, he said he would be open to playing again if a team needed an emergency quarterback. \"I'm not opposed to it,\" Brady told the DeepCut podcast, external.

        "text": " Olympic gold medallist Freya Anderson said she was \"nervous for the pain\" after she returned to the pool following a glandular fever diagnosis. The 23-year-old was diagnosed earlier this year and was a doubt for this week's British Olympic trials. Anderson raced the 100m freestyle on Sunday and was third fastest to reach the final, but must improve to make the qualifying time for the 2024 Games. \"I have not done any speed stuff in training,\" she said. GB newcomer Newman-Baronius equals world record \"I could count the number of sprints I have done on my hand,\" added Anderson. \"I was more nervous for the pain of it. \"I did the job and am through to the final. Hopefully I can get the time down a bit tonight.\" Anderson won gold as part of Great Britain's 4x100m mixed medley relay at the Tokyo Olympics. She also won bronze in 4x100m freestyle relay at the World Championships last year and was seventh in the 200m individual freestyle event. Having revealed her diagnosis in March, she sat out the 200m freestyle at the Aquatics GB Championships this week before competing over the shorter distance - her first race since January - in which she enters as the top seed by personal best time. \"The thing with glandular fever is there is nothing you can do but rest,\" she said.  \"I have a good week of training and then the fatigue will hit, or one week will be a write-off. It is something I have to be gentle with myself. \"I have compared it to the start of Covid where there was nothing you can do. I just have to accept it.\" Anna Hopkin, who has already won the 50m title in London this week, was the fastest qualifier for the final on Sunday in an impressive 53.68secs - marginally outside of the qualification time of 53.55secs. Eva Okaro was second in 54.60secs, followed by Anderson's 55.01secs. Only two swimmers can race in each event in Paris with the winner of each British final taking an automatic place, subject to them making the qualification time. The British coaches can use their discretion for the second pick, giving Anderson a chance of making the event even if she does not finish in the top two. Olympic champion Tom Dean was the fastest qualifier for Sunday's showpiece race - the 200m freestyle. The race has been billed as the most competitive domestic race on the planet with 2023 world champion Matt Richards and Olympic silver medallist Duncan Scott, plus James Guy - who won relay gold with the trio in Tokyo - also through to the final."

        "text": " New world champion Matt Richards says there is \"no reason\" why British swimmers cannot achieve a record Olympic medal haul at Paris 2024 after impressive performances at the World Championships. The team achieved a landmark total of eight medals at Tokyo 2020, a figure they equalled in the championships in Japan, despite the absence of talisman Adam Peaty. Richards was one of several GB swimmers who excelled in Fukuoka, claiming a maiden world 200m freestyle title before helping the men's 4x200m as well as the mixed 4x100m freestyle relay teams to gold and bronze respectively.  There were further honours for Tom Dean, Duncan Scott and Ben Proud, while Lauren Cox became the first female British swimmer to claim an individual world medal since 2015. \"We're all ambitious, we all want to keep improving and take the sport to another level,\" Richards told BBC Sport. \"The team is coming on, from strength to strength, and eight medals here even without Adam a year out from the Olympics - you can't ask for much more than that. \"I'd be lying if I said any of us thought this was our limit and there's no reason we can't achieve more next year.\" After winning a record-breaking four Olympic medals in Tokyo, Scott said the attitude Peaty had brought to the team had been crucial in changing the mindset following a disappointing London 2012 Olympics. That belief and desire to dominate is something five-time world champion and BBC Radio 5 Live swimming commentator Karen Pickering believes remains with the team, despite the Olympic gold medal winner's absence. She cites the positive response to the disqualification of the medal-contending men's 4x100m freestyle relay team on the opening day of the competition as evidence of a mentality shift. \"I've been really impressed by their resilience,\" Pickering tells BBC Sport. \"In years gone by, if that had happened, the meet would have ended up very differently, but that [Peaty] attitude is now within Tom Dean, Duncan Scott, Matt Richards and others.\" After securing his first World Championship titles at Kazan 2015, Peaty spoke about his ambition to \"dominate\" the sport and take his event to new levels. Dean is similar and, after claiming four medals in Fukuoka, aims to win \"even more\" at Paris 2024 - an approach Pickering hopes some of the female swimmers will adopt. \"Adam, Tom, Duncan, they're experienced at delivering and, even if they're not doing their best swims, they're still helping other people to do great swims. We haven't really had a 'banker' like that on the female side for a few years,\" she tells BBC Sport. \"We have some really good young prospects though, like Katie Shanahan and Freya Colbert [who were fourth and fifth in their respective best events at Fukuoka 2023]. \"At junior level, there's some great talent too but we need to make sure we do everything we can to help them progress because we seem to be doing better at that with the boys than with the girls.\" European junior 200m individual medley champion Leah Schlosshan and silver medallist Phoebe Cooper as well as distance swimmer Amelie Blocksidge, who became British senior champion at the age of 14 earlier this year, are among the prospects. British Swimming head coach Bill Furniss, who guided Rebecca Adlington to four Olympic medals, admits the women's side has been \"a little bit behind\" the men's in recent years but is encouraged by what he has witnessed recently. \"I think it the improvement is typified by not only Lauren Cox, but our relays,\" he tells BBC Sport. \"The women's 4x200m and 4x100m [freestyle relay teams] have struggled for some considerable time and now we've had two fourth places, so we're getting closer to that podium. \"That shows me how the depth is improving and we're very pleased with how the girls are coming through.\" Furniss also confirmed that Peaty, who took time out from the sport earlier this year to prioritise his mental health, is back training in a \"positive\" mindset and believes \"we'll see him again\" competitively before Paris 2024. The positive outlook for British aquatic sports a year ahead of Paris 2024 extends beyond the pool swimming programme. Four-time Olympic medallist Tom Daley has revealed he will soon return to diving, while Rio 2016 gold medallist Jack Laugher continues to deliver at the summit of the sport, securing 3m synchro silver with new partner Anthony Harding in Japan. Andrea Spendolini-Sirieix and Lois Toulson became the first British women to win a world diving medal by taking silver in the 10m synchronised, before 3m specialists Yasmin Harper and Scarlett Mew Jensen matched them 24 hours later. \"It's incredible and I'm so proud of us,\" Spendolini-Sirieix told BBC Sport.  \"To see women in sport excelling and proving we can do everything makes me so proud to achieve this goal and adding to history is a beautiful moment.\" The idea of Olympic medal success for Great Britain in artistic swimming might have seemed somewhat far-stretched 12 months ago. However, the introduction of new rules to improve transparency and competitiveness in the sport have proved to be a game-changer for British prospects. Kate Shortman and Izzy Thorpe claimed an historic European Championship bronze last month and Shortman secured Britain's first world medal in the sport with solo free bronze in Fukuoka. \"This year we've performed so well and finally done it on a world stage and hopefully people can see now that artistic swimming in Great Britain is on the way up,\" said Shortman. \"We're coming through, we're coming up and we need some funding because we're going for the Olympics next year and we want to medal in that too.\" The next major event for the majority of athletes across the aquatic disciplines will be the Doha 2024 World Championships in February."

        "text": " The places on the plane, or in this case train, are booked. After the Aquatics GB Swimming Championships, the majority of the British team for this summer's Olympics in Paris is confirmed.  Only the final spaces can now be filled by the coaches, while the Paralympic team will be selected in the coming weeks. After a week that included a return to form for Adam Peaty, British records and personal bests, two former swimming Olympians - Karen Pickering and Steve Parry - look at how the British Olympic team is shaping up and make some predictions for Paris. Richards wins epic 200m freestyle as Dean misses out defend Olympic gold Karen Pickering: It's a tough one, there have been so many great swims, but one that stands out is Ollie Morgan in the 100m backstroke - breaking that 15-year record of Liam Tancock. It was a tough British record to get. Liam had the advantage of the supersuits back then.  It's exciting for Morgan himself but also for the British medley relay team. Steve Parry: It is great we are seeing emerging talent but in an Olympic year you have to be focusing on where the medals are going to come from. To see the big guns come out and perform, the likes of Duncan Scott in the 200m individual medley finishing in one minute 55 seconds. That shows a global superstar like France's Leon Marchand is not going to have it all his own way. SP: Duncan Scott won four medals in Tokyo - the most a Briton has ever won at an Olympic Games. I wouldn't look further than Scott when looking to predict British medals. That 200m medley was the performance of the meet. Also combining Morgan's swim with Adam Peaty's 100m breaststroke here, GB are definitely in with a shout for a medal again in that 4x100m medley relay. KP: The depth of British talent in the men's 200m freestyle is such that we knew whoever stepped up would have a chance of a medal - potentially gold and silver. Matt Richards and Scott qualified so will have every chance. On the women's side, the swimmer that has impressed me and really come through is Freya Colbert, who qualified in three events - the 400m medley, the 200m freestyle and the 200m medley. She will be in the relays too. Freya has swam her best times when it matters and is so versatile. It is great to be able to work on different events because it keeps swimmers fresh.  KP: Katie Shanahan has said herself she was disappointed with her times this week.  Although she has qualified, she said she should have done better in the 200m backstroke. I still feel she has great potential come the Olympics. SP: You could look at Adam Peaty and say he is a second off his best time and someone who isn't familiar with what he has been through will wonder why. But Adam Peaty going 57-high is an unbelievable result. I am very excited about that 100m breaststroke race. China's Qin Haiyang, dubbed the Purple Dragon, won the 50m, 100m and 200m at the worlds last year. He is going to come up against Peaty.  That will be one of the events of the whole Olympics. SP: I am going to chicken out but winning gold in the same swimming event at three Olympics has only ever been done by one male before, and that was Michael Phelps.  With the backdrop of Adam saying he had his problems with alcoholism and depression it is not going to be easy and we have an amazing talent in Qin who is putting in 57.6secs times. KP: Qin is a machine. He was rolling out times at major championships. He is very, very impressive. However I do think Adam is in the best place he could be in mentally because he is the underdog. He has been the favourite for so long and that has been hard. It is so tough to stay at the top. By having this time out, Adam has given himself the freedom to go in without the pressure he would have had. KP: That is a tough one. The events we are the strongest are some of the events that are the strongest in the world. There's the 50m and 100m freestyle, the backstroke events. Just look at the number of Australians in the sprint freestyle races. The best chance would be in the 400m medley with Colbert.  SP: I'm going to go for a hard no, just because of the competition. Freya is a fantastic talent but in that race you will have Canada's Summer McIntosh. She is a generational talent and this could be the Games she stamps her authority. It is not easy to expect gold medals. We have been spoilt.  SP: That's an easy one for me.  This Olympics is in France. It's at a $200m aquatics centre. They are going to expect a new hero and it will be Leon Marchand in that 200m individual medley. A lot of people won't have been watching the American Collegiate Championships but Marchand has been tearing it up. He is rewriting the record books. His father was a swimmer. His mother was an international swimmer as well. If there was a breeding programme for the perfect French swimmer you would pick that. KP: Marchand will be swimming other events as well - the 200m butterfly, 400m medley and could even do the 200m breaststroke. I can't get away from that. The noise in that arena when a French swimmer touches the wall first, it's given me goosebumps just thinking about it. SP: Eight! 12 months ago that would have been hard to say but I am starting to believe. KP: Agreed. I would say we will equal what we did in Tokyo."

        "text": " Matt Richards won an epic men's 200m freestyle race at the British Championships in London but Olympic champion Tom Dean missed out on the chance to defend his title in Paris. Richards won a race billed as the most competitive domestic contest in history with Duncan Scott taking silver. Dean was third but only two can race in the event at this summer's Olympics, although he will contest other events. \"It lived up to the hype,\" said 2023 world 200m freestyle champion Richards. \"That was probably the best field you are going to find domestically. It was great practice for the Olympics.\" The trio, who won gold together in the 4x200m freestyle relay at the Tokyo Olympics, have battled each other in events all week but this race was always expected to be the championship's grand finale. Seven of the eight men in the final were former Olympians with Scott, 26, the Olympic silver medallist when Dean won gold in Tokyo. Richards, 21, won gold in the event at last year's World Championships and Dean, 23, silver but it is the latter who missed out on qualification. Dean, who had set himself a bold target of five medals in Paris, had already effectively qualified for the 200m individual medley on Thursday by taking silver but also missed out on the place for the 100m freestyle event. \"I knew it was going to take a momentous effort,\" Dean said. \"It is fine margins and you can pay for it at the front end. \"I have been top three in the world for three years in a row and it shows the calibre of this competition. This is what you've got to do to just get on the team.  \"I have spoken about my big medal aims in Paris. That is still there. I want to win individual medals, relay medals and do as much as I can for the team. I have got to reset and slightly refocus.\" Richards said: \"I said to him at the end of the race it is so bitter-sweet because in a perfect world we would love it if we could all get in there and race. \"There is always going to be someone who just misses out and Deano is a phenomenal talent.\" James Guy finished fourth meaning he will travel to Paris for the relay as the same quartet - Guy, Dean, Scott and Richards - will look to defend the title they won in Tokyo. Elsewhere on the final night of the championships, 12-year-old Iona Winnifrith shared the women's para 100m breaststroke title with Brock Whiston to put herself in line for Paralympic qualification. The pair, plus four others in the race - Maisie Summers-Newton, Rebecca Redfern, Grace Harvey, Louise Fiddes - made the nomination time for Paris with the Paralympic team to be confirmed in the coming months. Will Ellard equalled the S14 200m freestyle world record for his third title of the week, beating his fourth Paris nomination time in the process. Fourteen-year-old Amelie Blocksidge won the women's 800m freestyle title but missed out on the time needed for the Olympics. Anna Hopkin will race the 100m freestyle in Paris after she completed the sprint double by following up her win in the 50m event. Freya Anderson, on her return from glandular fever, was third and requires a coaches' pick to make the team. Oliver Morgan also won his second title of the week, backing up his 100m backstroke with an impressive finish to win the 200m event. He beat the qualification time, as did Luke Greenbank in second, meaning the pair will likely compete again in Paris. Tully Kearney won her second title of the meet, clinching the para 100m freestyle crown under the time needed for Paris while Angharad Evans won the 100m breaststroke but was outside of the Olympic time.

        "text": " Current and former world champions Freya Colbert and Matt Richards secured their places at the Paris Olympics by winning British titles in London. Colbert backed up world gold by winning the 400m medley and achieved the Olympic qualification time. Richards won a stacked men's 100m freestyle final with 200m Olympic champion Tom Dean missing out and Scotland's Duncan Scott taking silver. \"That race was just as high pressure as an Olympic final,\" Richards said. \"I thought I was capable of a bit quicker - maybe it wasn't the best executed race but I can't complain. \"I got the job done and have left plenty in the tank for the summer.\" Richards, the 2023 200m freestyle world champion, Dean and Scott, the Olympic silver medallist from the 200m freestyle, were all under the Olympic qualification time but with only two spots available for the Olympics per event, Richards took the automatic place and Scott is in prime position for the second. The trio will all compete again in Sunday's 200m freestyle - a race which could be even more hotly contested - while Dean and Scott have further chances to qualify individually for Paris in the 200m medley on Friday. Alex Cohoon's time in fourth was enough to secure him a place at a first Olympics as part of the 4x100m relay squad, along with Richards, Scott and Dean. Colbert had already won the 200m freestyle British title this week but had said she was unlikely to race that event in Paris because of a clash with her main event, the 400m medley. She and Katie Shanahan were a class above the field in the final with Scot Shanahan also under the qualification time and likely to take the second Olympic place. No British woman has won an individual Olympic swimming title since Rebecca Adlington in 2008 but Colbert, who won in a personal best time of four minutes 34.01 seconds, played down her chances of ending the wait. In Paris she will likely race Canadian world record holder, 17-year-old Summer McIntosh, who was absent from this year's worlds. \"McIntosh is head and shoulders above the rest,\" Colbert said. \"I am not going to be saying I am going to do it. I don't know if this will be the time.  \"I would love it to be but I am also very realistic. I know what the rest of the field looks like.\" Across the night, the winners of all five Olympic events secured their places for Paris by each going under the qualification time. First, Wales' Daniel Jervis booked a spot at his second Olympics by winning the 1500m freestyle title and dipping just over six seconds below the required time of 14 minutes 54.29 seconds. Anna Hopkin, who won gold as part of the mixed 4x100m relay team in Tokyo, dominated the 50m freestyle. Max Litchfield, a world silver medallist this year, then won the men's 400m medley in a British record time of 4:09.14 to give himself the chance to go one better than fourth-placed finishes at the past two Olympics. In the para events, Stephen Clegg and Alice Tai won their second titles of the week - the para-100m freestyle and the para-50m freestyle respectively. Both were again under the nomination time for the Paralympics and although that team still has to be selected, both have all-but sealed their places on the team. Scarlett Humphrey took bronze behind Tai but her effort was inside the Paralympic time in her S11 classification. Will Ellard set a new S14 100m freestyle world record in the men's heats but did not race in the final as the event is not a Paralympic event.  Ellard also posted a new S14 British record in the 100m backstroke on Wednesday which gave him silver behind S12 swimmer Clegg and also looks set to travel to Paris this summer."

        "text": " Twenty-three Chinese swimmers tested positive for a banned drug before the Tokyo Olympics in 2021 but were cleared to compete after the country's anti-doping agency found the results were caused by contamination. The swimmers all tested positive for heart medication trimetazidine (TMZ) at a training camp seven months before the delayed Games. China Anti-Doping Agency (Chinada) determined they had unintentionally ingested the substance and would not face any punishment. The country's 30-member swimming team won six medals at the Tokyo Olympics, including three golds. Details of the case were revealed by the New York Times,, external who shared reporting with German broadcaster ARD. United States Anti-Doping Agency (Usada) chief executive Travis Tygart said it was \"crushing\" to hear of the positive tests before an Olympic Games. He said the World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada) and Chinada had \"swept these positives under the carpet by failing to fairly and evenly follow the global rules that apply to everyone else in the world\", while athletes \"impacted by this potential cover-up\" had been \"deeply and painfully betrayed by the system\". \"All of those with dirty hands in burying positive tests and suppressing the voices of courageous whistleblowers must be held accountable to the fullest extent of the rules and law,\" Tygart added. Britain's Olympic swimming champion Adam Peaty questioned why the information was not released earlier, adding: \"So disappointing from Wada.\" In response to Tygart's statement, Wada said it was \"astonished by the outrageous, completely false and defamatory remarks\" and his \"very serious accusations against Wada\", adding that it had referred his comments to its lawyers. \"Mr Tygart's allegations are politically motivated,\" Wada added, and \"the damaging comments have been delivered without any supporting evidence whatsoever\". Tygart has since accused Wada of \"threats and scare tactics\". Wada earlier confirmed to BBC Sport it was notified of Chinada's decision in June 2021. The world body said it \"carefully reviewed\" the case and consulted independent experts to \"test the contamination theory\" as well as external legal counsel. Wada concluded it was \"not in a position to disprove the possibility that contamination was the source of TMZ\", the athletes bore \"no fault\" and an appeal against Chinada's decision was \"not warranted\". Olivier Rabin, Wada's senior director of science and medicine, added: \"The contamination scenario was further supported by the combination of the consistently low concentrations of TMZ as well as no doping pattern with several athletes presenting multiple samples collected over the course of several days which fluctuated between negative and positive [and vice versa].\" Russian figure skater Kamila Valieva was ultimately given a four-year ban for doping after testing positive for TMZ in December 2021, shortly before competing in the 2022 Winter Olympics. Chinese Olympic swimming champion Sun Yang served a three-month ban in 2014 after testing positive for TMZ. He is currently serving a separate doping ban, which was reduced from eight years to four years and three months in June 2021. Swimming's governing body World Aquatics, then known as Fina, was also notified about the adverse analytical findings (AAFs) in 2021. World Aquatics said it was \"carefully considered\" by Fina's doping control review board. It added: \"World Aquatics is confident that these AAFs were handled diligently and professionally, and in accordance with all applicable anti-doping regulations, including the World Anti-Doping Code.\" Chinada told the New York Times it found the swimmers had not broken anti-doping rules and was not obliged to publish details about the case without their consent. Wada shared its conclusions with the International Testing Agency (ITA), which in 2022 raised issues regarding TMZ samples possibly being misreported. Usada contacted Wada in April 2023 saying it had received a tip that positive TMZ cases had been hidden. Wada said its intelligence and investigations department \"concluded that proper procedures had been followed and that there was no evidence of wrongdoing\". Gunter Younger, Wada's director of intelligence and investigations, added: \"The data held by us clearly showed that there had been no attempt to hide the positive tests as they had been reported in the usual way by the Chinese authorities.\" The ITA said it received \"confidential and anonymous information\" in summer 2021 about the positive tests. It added: \"In parallel to a full assessment of the information received that remains active, the ITA conducted many targeted follow-up testing missions in 2021, 2022, 2023 and up until today.\""

        "text": " Jersey swimmer Filip Nowacki has the potential to make the Olympic Games, his coach has said. The 16-year-old broke the 100m breaststroke record in the heats at last week's British Championships.  Nowacki won three medals at last year's Commonwealth Youth Games and also won a European Youth Olympics silver medal. \"If you are good at your sport and professional, and if you listen to the people around you, everything's possible,\" his coach Nathan Jegou said. \"I think from his perspective he's at a good age as he's 16 now, in four years time he'll be 20 and in eight years time he'll be 24, which is peak age at swimming.  \"You could argue the next two cycles are really important to him and his swimming career, if that's something he wants to to choose,\" he told BBC Sport. Nowacki was beaten by Olympic champion Adam Peaty in the final and he is hopeful his performances at the London Aquatic Centre will be enough to earn him selection for the European Junior Championships later this year.  Should the Commonwealth Games go ahead in 2026 he would also likely be part of Jersey's team and is preparing to leave Jersey to move to Millfield School in the summer, where Olympic champions James Guy and Matt Richards have honed their craft.  \"He's broken a British junior record which is under 16, he's broken two age group records and he's done some short course age group records in the winter, so that would tell us that he's on a good pathway,\" Tigers Swimming Club head coach Jegou added. \"He's got a good level head on him. He knows it's a long journey, it's not all about tomorrow. \"He thinks ahead and he has a good lad that's a little bit younger than him who's following him and breaking his records as he goes.  \"I think that's a good thing as well as it keeps him on his toes, but from his perspective he looks at the next target, so he targeted this meet, had a few little little niggles, wasn't quite feeling 100% and still performed really well.\""

        "text": " After missing the Tokyo Paralympics, Para-swimmer Brock Whiston says she wants to put the tough times behind her and secure her place at the Paris Games. The 27-year-old goes in this week's British Swimming Championships at the London Aquatics Centre - a special venue for her - hoping for performances to put her in line for selection.  Not only does Whiston do one of her weekly training sessions in the pool, back in 2019 she made her Great Britain debut there at the World Para Swimming Championships, bursting on to the scene by winning golds in the 100m breaststroke and 200m medley - both in world record times - and helping GB to two relay titles. Issues around her eligibility and category meant the Londoner was unable to compete in the Tokyo Paralympics in 2021 and the 2022 Commonwealth Games in Birmingham. \"I couldn't even watch the Games on television,\" she said. \"I considered giving up but I love swimming and the challenge. \"It has made me a stronger athlete and more determined to get the qualifying times and go to Paris to thank all of those who supported me on the way. \"If it had been an easy journey it wouldn't have made me who I am.\" As a youngster, Whiston was frequently accused of being 'lazy'. She struggled with her co-ordination, crawling with just her right leg while her left leg dragged and she would trip over it when she was tired. As she got older she started to struggle more with her physicality and also suffered frequent shoulder dislocations, puzzling doctors before eventually being diagnosed with hemiplegia - which causes weakness and paralysis - on her left-hand side. \"It was a relief when someone finally explained why I was finding some things hard,\" she says. \"As you are growing, you can compensate for things - and that is what I did - but it is harder to adapt as you get older.\" The dislocations still happen on a regular basis - with one even occurring during one of Whiston's finals at last year's World Championships in Manchester.  \"It happens in most of my training sessions, I could be lying-in, watching television, and it will happen,\" she explains.  \"My mum knows how to put it back in place now, so do I, so does my boyfriend and my coach. Sometimes it just will keep sliding in and out, it depends how fatigued I am.  \"Everyone on the British team knows I love napping and can do three or four hours at a time. But that is what I need to be able to perform in the pool. \"At one point I considered having my arm amputated but I was told that was too dangerous an operation. \"Doctors also tried to fix it in place but when they put the shoulder in the position it should be in, it caused me so much pain that I couldn't cope.\" Swimming was always part of Whiston's life and she took part in non-disabled competition throughout her younger years. Back in 2012, she was among the crowds at the London Paralympics, cheering on Ellie Simmonds to gold before she realised that she too could follow in Simmonds' footsteps as a Para-swimmer. She obtained her international classification in 2018. Her coach, Stewart Nicklin at the Barking and Dagenham club, has been key to her success and they are constantly learning from each other to get the best results. \"We work hard together - sometimes when I think I can't do it, he just tells me to get on with it,\" she says.  \"There are times when my hands won't work properly at the end of a session and I am exhausted, and my coach has to take my goggles and hat off and give me my drinks bottle.\" Whiston started her career in the S8 category before being moved to the S9 category, where she competed against less-impaired rivals. After going through classification again earlier this year, she is back as an S8., external Despite the changes, she says she remains focused on her own race and performance and starts her bid for Paris with the 400m freestyle on Friday, the 100m butterfly and 200m medley on Saturday and the 100m breaststroke and 100m freestyle on Sunday. \"There are some greats in both categories but at the end of day you are just there to do what you can do and race your own race,\" she says. \"Classification is done on observation and what the classifiers perceive you to be, and you are scored in and out of the pool. \"People can agree with it or disagree with it but it is the system. There will always be a variation of impairments within a class but you just have to get on with it and be grateful that you are in a position where you can still swim.\" Who are the new Posh & Becks?

        "text": " The maths is stark. Three into two won't go. Britain has three leading names in the men's 200m freestyle, all seeking Olympic places. Tom Dean is the Olympic champion. Duncan Scott won silver at Tokyo 2020. Matt Richards won gold at the 2023 world championships. All three will line up in the event at the British Swimming Championships in London this week - the meet that doubles as Britain's Olympic and Paralympic trials. The catch? Only two can qualify for the event in Paris this summer. \"It is scary because if it goes wrong, you are not going - it is that difficult,\" Richards told the BBC. \"But I can't wait. I will be really excited that morning. It will then be about trying to keep it cool and stay composed ready for the race.\" An Englishman, a Scot and an Welshman, the trio are team-mates, friends and rivals who won relay gold together alongside James Guy at the last Olympics in Tokyo. England's Dean and Scotland's Scott have spent time as room-mates while Wales' Richards, the youngest of the three at 21, has been tipped as the next big thing in British swimming. Both he and Dean want to become the first Briton to win five medals at a single Olympics.  The current record is four, held by Scott. When Dean won Olympic gold in the event in Tokyo, he pipped Scott to the touch by just 0.04 seconds. When Richards produced a shock to beat Dean in the 2023 world championships, the margin of victory was even less - a mere 0.02 seconds. \"I love the rivalries between us all,\" Richards told BBC Wales. \"We're all really good friends first, which makes it quite special. \"But when we are in the water, we're all competitors and we all want to beat each other.  \"There is a lot of pressure on it, but at the same time we all want to see each other do well. Maybe just one one hundredth less well than yourself!\" While Dean is the champion and Richards the rising star, Scott is the elder statesman at 26. He was considering his future in the sport after a difficult 2023 dogged by illness and mixed results. Scott has found form this year, however, and has likened the build-up to the 200m freestyle British showdown to the end of a boxing match with each convinced he has done enough to win. \"Whether I'm lying or telling the truth, I've got to say that I'm fully, fully believing,\" the Scot, who will also contest the 100m freestyle against Dean and Richards, plus the 200m individual medley alongside Dean, told BBC Sport last month. \"I'm confident in the work that I've done for sure. I think that's really exciting, especially given where I was at last year.\" For the Olympics, the winner of each event is guaranteed a place in the team in Paris this summer. The second spot will be chosen by British Swimming's performance director and head coach. Away from the 200m freestyle, Adam Peaty will look to secure his place to compete for a third successive 100m breaststroke gold medal in Paris. The 29-year-old, who went eight years unbeaten over the distance between 2014 and 2022, won bronze at the world championships in February as he makes his comeback following a mental health break last year. He is expected to have few issues qualifying the Olympics when he races on Tuesday, day one of the trials at London Aquatics Centre. Laura Stephens won 200m butterfly world gold in February.  She will race in that event, plus the 100m, while Freya Colbert, another 2024 world champion, will race the 400m individual medley, the event in which she won her world title, plus the 200m individual medley and 100m and 200m freestyle. Tokyo relay gold medallist Freya Anderson will make a late decision on whether to race, as she has been struggling with glandular fever. Para-swimming events will be fully integrated into the finals programme for the first time. For those hoping to compete at the Paralympics, the selection process for Paris is slightly different - swimmers must meet qualifying times to be considered for a place on the team. They will take part in multi-class events, meaning swimmers from every category are in the same race, with the one closest to the world record in their class declared the winner and the British champion. Britain won 14 golds at last year's World Championships in Manchester and picked up 26 medals - including eight golds - at the Tokyo Paralympics in 2021. In the absence of six-time gold medallist Bethany Firth, who is pregnant, Poppy Maskill and newcomer Olivia Newman-Baronius will aim to step up in the S14 category and secure places at their first Games. Alice Tai, who won 4x100m relay gold in Rio but missed Tokyo through injury and then had her right leg amputated in early 2022,, external will be hoping to make her Games return. Tokyo gold medallists Maisie Summers-Newton and Tully Kearney, who has returned to the S5 category after being classified as an S6 for last year's worlds, and current world champions Ellie Challis, Stephen Clegg, Suzanna Hext and Faye Rogers will also be among those in action. Each of the finals sessions (from 19:00 BST) will be shown live on the BBC Sport website and app, plus the Red Button from Tuesday, 2 April until Sunday, 7 April. There will also be daily reports on the BBC Sport website and app."

        "text": " By the time James Guy turned 24, he had smashed British Swimming records and become a world and European champion. Deep down, though, he still felt something was not quite right. That year, life finally began to make sense for Guy as he was diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).  Looking back now as a double Olympic champion, 28-year-old Guy realises that he was never broken. He was just different. It is estimated that at least one in seven people in the UK are neurodivergent. This term describes someone who thinks differently because of conditions including autism, dyslexia, dyspraxia and ADHD. While a diagnosis has helped Guy understand himself, growing up without it took a lasting toll. \"At around the age of 15 I was put in study support lessons for extra help at school because I wasn't the brightest guy in the world,\" he tells BBC Sport.  \"I found things difficult to understand and needed the teacher to repeat themselves four times, just to soak it in. \"I felt left out. My friends would laugh and take the mick. I didn't take notice of it because they were my best mates, but it was quite embarrassing.\"  Though his school was accommodating, Guy believes there were not enough resources to identify his ADHD at the time. As he entered his 20s, he found his symptoms persisting outside of the educational setting and affecting everyday life. With that returned the longing for an answer. \"In my day-to-day life, I can be very easily distracted,\" he says. \"I'll start one job, not finish it, do another thing, and not finish it. I'm trying my hardest, but I can't help it at all. \"Even if Courtney (his fiancee) is talking to me, she'll say, 'Are you listening?' I'd be like 'Yeah' and she'd say, 'Well what did I say?' and I'm like 'er\u00e2\u0080\u00a6' - not in a rude way but because my brain diverges. \"I told my psychologist that I'm either 10 miles an hour ahead or 10 miles an hour behind. There is no in between.\" In the following four years, a diagnosis has allowed Guy to fully embrace life in the pool with ADHD and for British Swimming to tailor support to his needs. \"I find it hard to sit still and I have to be doing something all the time and that is why swimming is really good for me,\" he says. \"When I go home, because I'm so mentally tired, I can sit on the sofa and relax. \"If Ryan (his coach) is reading something out the first time, it's never going to go in my brain. I need to physically see it and have it repeated. \"I love what I do every single day. The thrill you get after having a good session is massive. It's very rare I have a bad day.\" Guy will be competing at the British Swimming Championships from 2-7 April, looking to qualify for his third successive Olympics with Team GB. And through fostering self-acceptance, the 200m freestyle and 100m butterfly specialist has found ways of using ADHD to his advantage, including winning two golds at Tokyo 2020. \"If I'm doing something, I always commit to it 100%. It might take me a while to get there, but you'll do things properly and not half-heartedly which is a valuable tool in everyday life,\" he says. A diagnosis is not always a neat resolution, as 80% of adults with ADHD have a mental health problem, external at some point in their lifetime. This is all too familiar for the swimmer who has experienced health anxiety since his mid-20s. \"Sometimes I get really anxious when an important session or race is coming up in six weeks' time,\" he says. \"Even though it's a long time away, my stomach feels bloated, or my appetite goes for a few days. \"It's not a nice place to be in, but I've learned how to acknowledge and manage it. \"Sometimes, I'm really afraid of getting ill because I don't want to miss anything in the pool. I'll search my symptoms and have all the medication ready to go. \"I'll need the doctor to say to me, 'don't worry about it, James'. If that support wasn't there, I would genuinely struggle to deal with it on my own.\" Throughout this journey, Guy stresses the importance of not feeling afraid to talk about neurodivergence or mental health. \"My fiancee, mum, dad and brother have always supported me. They understand I have ADHD and don't care about it. They love me for who I am. \"Look at the athletes who are doing really well. There are a lot of mental health issues because we're cocooned in this bubble where we don't know what real life is. \"We put ourselves through pain every single day. It's not normal and it's not how I believe life should be lived.\" This support and awareness mean the days of feeling like an outsider are long gone for Guy. He only wishes he had grown up with it. \"I would tell 12-year-old James to\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 go and do an ADHD test,\" he laughs.

The 29-year-old was among those to secure their places with swims at the British trials earlier this month. Freya Anderson, a relay gold medallist from Tokyo, contracted glandular fever this year and missed automatic qualification but has been picked. Breaststroker James Wilby is another given a coaches' discretionary pick. What are Team GB's medal chances in Paris? Who is competing in Paris for Team GB? Peaty, who also won mixed relay gold in Tokyo, impressively won the British title earlier this month after difficulties with injury and his mental health since the Tokyo Games. Two-time Olympic champion Tom Dean is also included, while Matt Richards is targeting five medals in Paris after winning the 100m and 200m freestyle events at the British trials. Duncan Scott will be another strong medal hope after winning the 200m individual medley and qualifying in the freestyle races behind Richards.

        "text": " Olivia Newman-Baronius equalled the S14 100m butterfly world record in her first major event to all but confirm her place at this summer's Paralympics. The 17-year-old said the Games were not on her radar three weeks ago before she swam at a World Series event in Italy. But on Saturday she put in the joint-fastest time in history in her classification - one minute 3.33 seconds - to win the British title. \"I couldn't really believe it,\" the teenager said. \"I couldn't see the board, I just heard it.\" Newman-Baronius won four medals on her Great Britain debut in Italy in March, but the Aquatics GB Swimming Championships are her biggest championships to date. She has met the Paralympic nomination time in four events at the London Aquatics Centre - the 200m freestyle, 100m backstroke, 200m individual medley, plus the 100m butterfly - and her first title effectively rubberstamps her place for this summer's European Championships and the Paralympics that follow. \"I didn't get diagnosed with autism until October last year,\" she said. \"This [racing at the Paralympics] hadn't occurred to me until I was in Italy that it was possible.\" In the battle for Olympic qualification, Ben Proud put in the third-fastest 50m freestyle title of his career to give him a shot at an elusive Olympic medal in Paris. The 29-year-old has won medals at every major championships bar the Olympics, including world bronze this year and the 2022 world title. He finished in 21.25 seconds in London, with Matt Richards also under the qualification time after winning the 100m freestyle earlier in the week. \"Clearly I would love to have the whole collection but I have put myself through hell trying to get that Olympic medal,\" Proud said. \"You have to dream, you have to want it. But you don't have to need it.\" In the final race of the night, Abbie Wood produced a personal best in the 200m individual medley to comfortably clear the qualification time for Paris.  Her effort of 2:08.91 would have won bronze at this year's world championships in Doha. \"I just want to be as competitive as I was at the last Olympics because it is always more fun when you are in the mix,\" said the 25-year-old, who reached the final of the event in Tokyo three years ago. Elsewhere, Toby Robinson, who will compete in the open water events in Paris, swam a personal best to win the 800m freestyle title but was outside the required time for Olympic qualification. Similarly, James Wilby won the men's 200m breaststroke and Keanna MacInnes the women's 100m butterfly but missed times for Paris, although MacInnes has already qualified in the 200m event. Tully Kearney swam a British record in the women's para 50m backstroke and, along with silver medallist Ellie Challis, made the nomination time to put herself in contention for the Paralympics. Brock Whiston won her second event of the week, the para 200m medley. The S8 swimmer made the nomination time, as did S6 Paralympic champion and world record holder Maisie Summers-Newton and S14 swimmer Poppy Maskill. Scot Stephen Clegg won his fourth title of the meet in the para 50m freestyle. He did not make the nomination time for Paris but is already all but confirmed to travel to the Paralympics thanks to his other events."

        "text": " Duncan Scott said this summer's Olympics will be \"pretty special\" after he set up another tilt at gold by winning the 200m medley British title. He beat rival Tom Dean and was under the qualification time to impressively win in one minute 55.91 seconds. Scott won Olympic silver in the event in 2021, one of four Tokyo medals, and will likely challenge Dean and dominant Frenchman Leon Marchand in Paris. \"It's a stacked event like all of the events,\" the Scot, 26, said. Scott, who has six Olympic medals but is yet to win an individual gold, showed his form again with the second-quickest time of his career, having taken silver in the 100m freestyle on Thursday. Dean, the Olympic champion in the 200m freestyle, was also under the qualification time, 0.53 seconds behind in silver to effectively seal his place in the event in Paris and keep alive his bid for a record five medals in Paris. Scott took silver and Dean bronze at last year's World Championships, behind Marchand who has broken various medley records in recent years, including the great American Michael Phelps' world record over 400m. Another contender will be China's Wang Shun, who won gold in Tokyo and set the fastest time in the world last year. \"I try not to look at what other people are doing around the world but you have to block quite a few things out to avoid what he [Marchand] is doing,\" said Scott, who was already confirmed to travel to Paris for the men's 4x100m freestyle relay, and is likely to compete in the 100m freestyle after his results this week. \"He is a really special talent with what he is able to do - break Phelps' record, I thought as a young kid I would never see that go.  \"He is really special but at the same time there is Wang, and plenty of Americans. It's going to be pretty special.\" Elsewhere, 21-year-old Honey Osrin won the women's 200m backstroke title with a personal best time to secure her place at a first Olympics.  Katie Shanahan also made it under the qualification time for the silver medal - her second of the week following her performance in the 400m medley. Stephen Clegg won his third gold of the week in the para 100m butterfly while Brock Whiston also won the para 400m freestyle under the qualification standard. William Ellard won his first title of the week in the para 200m medley, having already set a world record and a British record in his previous events this week, to all but seal his place at the Paralympics. There was also a major shock in the men's 100m butterfly as Joe Litchfield, younger brother of Max who won the 400m individual medley on Thursday, took the title - a result that has an intriguing impact on one of Team GB's medal targets in Paris, the men's 100m medley relay. Although Litchfield missed the qualification time for the individual event, he will travel to the Olympics for the butterfly leg of that race, having beaten the favourite Jacob Peters and two-time Olympic relay gold medallist James Guy. Peters hit the qualification time in the heats but was off the pace in the final, managing only third, while Guy was fifth. Litchfield's 100m fly personal best, made in Friday's final, is 0.55 seconds slower than Peters but, unless there is a surprise in another event or the coaches use their discretionary picks to take a second option, it will be he who lines up in the relay squad, likely alongside Adam Peaty, new British backstroke record holder Oliver Morgan and one of Britain's array of elite freestylers. In the night's other events, Holly Hibbott won the 400m freestyle title but missed out on the Olympic time while Harvey Phillips won the para 50m breaststroke but was outside of the nomination time for Paris."

        "text": " Switzerland's Marco Odermatt won the downhill title to secure his fourth men's Alpine skiing World Cup crystal globe this season. Odermatt was awarded the title after the final race was called off because of poor weather in the Austrian resort of Saalbach. Crystal globes are awarded to the winner of each category in the World Cup. He had already secured the overall, super-G and giant slalom globes. Odermatt becomes the first male skier since Austrian Hermann Maier in 2001 to win four globes in a single season. The 26-year-old led France's Cyprien Sarrazin by 42 points going into the final race in which 100 points would have been available. \"For sure it's very strange to win a globe after such a tight battle with Cyprien,\" said Odermatt. \"We both would have been ready for every decision. We saw it on the inspection. I'm not sure safety can be guaranteed. \"It's a good decision for sure from my side, but I think as well for the sport it was a fair decision. But we would have liked to battle it out.\" Odermatt won two of the eight downhills completed during the season, while Sarrazin won three. \"For safety it was a good decision, so there is no problem,\" said Sarrazin. \"I wanted to have a fair race and a safe race and that's how it is. We will enjoy tonight because it was an amazing season. \"I'm really happy. I'm proud of myself. I never stopped believing. It was an amazing journey.\"  Odermatt's compatriot Lara Gut-Behrami won the overall, giant slalom and super-G titles in the women's disciplines and had been seeking a fourth crystal globe in Saturday's final race of the season. However, Austria's Cornelia Huetter took the women's downhill World Cup title to stop Gut-Behrami becoming only the fourth woman to win four globes in a season after Americans Mikaela Shiffrin and Lindsey Vonn, and Slovenia's Tina Maze.

Nicoll, 27, and Placide, 19, finished second in the two-woman event with a time of one minute 54.2 seconds from their two runs. It is only the second medal won by a British women's team in 15 years. Britain's Corie Mapp also took silver in the men's para-bobsleigh event. Placide had never stepped into a bobsleigh until this winter, while Nicoll had only three world cup starts in the two-woman discipline before Saturday. However, she was part of the last British women's team to win a world cup medal, alongside Mica McNeill in Sigulda, Latvia in January 2022.  Nicoll was \"extremely proud\" of her and fellow Welsh competitor Placide's efforts.. \"To be able to produce that performance on the track that is holding the World Championships next year is a huge confidence boost,\" she said. \"We came here with the aim of learning the track so we could go into next season with some experience here, but we've come away with a silver medal. We couldn't really be any happier. \"We're so grateful to everyone who's supported us to get us here. It started last season when I decided to jump in the front seat. Just having those people in our federation back home believing in you and supporting you to make decisions and push you to be better has been a big thing for us.\" Placide said: \"I'm feeling on top of the world, to be honest. I never, ever thought a World Cup medal would come this early into my career. I'm almost lost for words. \"We want to thank the whole of the BBSA, especially our coach, Sean (Olsson) and our performance director, Mark (Silva), plus everyone else who has supported us along the way.\" The 2023 two-woman bobsleigh world champions Kim Kalicki and Leonie Fiebig of Germany finished 0.81 seconds ahead of the British pair.  Germany's Olympic champion Laura Nolte, with Claudia Schussler, came third to seal the overall world cup title and retain the gold crystal globe trophy she won last year. Meanwhile, Mapp's silver in La Plagne, France, means the 45-year-old only has to finish in the top six of Sunday's event to take the overall 2023-24 World Cup crown, having finished in the medals in five of the seven races so far this season."

Friday's 2-1 triumph - Britain's first victory against Slovenia in almost a decade - leaves them third in the Division 1 Group B standings. Britain came from behind to win through goals from Katherine Gale and skipper Jodie Alderson-Smith. They face tournament hosts Latvia in Saturday's key final game (17:30 BST). \"The atmosphere of a full rink with noisy home fans playing for a medal is exactly the kind of experience we need for the team to get where we want to be,\" said Britain head coach Mike Clancy. Latvia sit second in the standings, ahead of Britain on goal difference after thrashing Poland 6-0 on Friday. Britain, who have won two and lost two of their group games, will be guaranteed a silver medal with victory but any other result would open the door for Slovenia or Italy, who meet each other, to pip them to bronze. Clancy's side still harbour a chance of a gold medal and promotion to a higher group if they beat Latvia - but that would require an unlikely defeat for leaders Slovakia against bottom side Poland. Pia Pren put Slovenia ahead against the run of play in Riga, but Britain levelled immediately through Gale and won it through Alderson-Smith, surviving a two-player disadvantage in the closing stages because of penalties incurred."

        "text": " Britain's most successful alpine skier Dave Ryding says his sport needs to \"move with the times\" by shifting races to higher altitudes, and did not rule out the possibility of competing indoors. Unseasonably warm temperatures hit the World Cup ski season this year, leading to race cancellations, including three out of 13 planned slaloms, which is his speciality. Sorry scenes of a thin white strip of artificial piste snaking down an otherwise brown or green mountain have prompted questions over whether the days of alpine skiing as we know it might be numbered. Ryding, on the back of his most successful season at the age of 37, said it was time for the sport's governing body, the International Ski Federation (FIS) to come up with a \"Plan B\" and that \"this year was maybe a season too late\" for change. In an interview with BBC Sport, he said there were plenty of resorts at an altitude above 3,000m which could be used rather than scheduling races at only 800m in March.  Asked what his sport might look like for future generations, Ryding said: \"I don't think they'll have to go indoors, but they could do. Saudi Arabia are building some almighty indoor ski slopes. \"I think it would go to higher altitudes first. I mean, we're still skiing on glaciers in the summer, and there's snow. So in the winter there's going to be snow.\" Ryding, who started skiing on dry slopes, said he hoped they would not end up racing on those, though joked he would be \"pretty good at it\". Heavy rain caused the cancellation of last month's slalom at Kranjska Gora, Slovenia (just above 800m), where temperatures were in the mid-teens, Celsius. That followed slaloms being scrapped in Val d'Isere, France in December because of rain and snow, and Bansko, Bulgaria after heavy rain in February. Seven of the first nine alpine skiing World Cup men's races across all disciplines were cancelled in the 2023-24 season. In total 13 men's and eight women's races were cancelled, with five of those replaced.   After the men's slalom in Chamonix in February, where Swiss Daniel Yule staged an unprecedented comeback from 30th place after the first run to win the title, climatologist Mark Maslin said climate change had played a part.  The top 30 from the first run race in reverse order, meaning Yule started first on the second run before \"snow started to melt quickly for the remaining racers in the sizzling 12 degrees Celsius\", according to Maslin.  The questions about how the sport might look in future come at a time when Great Britain are enjoying success on the slopes, with Ryding saying the next 20 years \"looks really good\" for the team, particularly in slalom. Ryding has finished on the podium in a World Cup race at least once in the past four seasons, securing his seventh this season with a third-place finish in Madonna di Campiglio, Italy in November. He finished a career-best joint seventh in the overall slalom standings in his 15th World Cup season.  The success has come despite a cut in funding for the British alpine team by UK Sport following the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing for the next four-year Olympic cycle. Ryding and the others set up crowdfunding to continue their careers and are paying back their supporters with results. Slalom team-mates Billy Major, 27, and Laurie Taylor, 28, have also enjoyed their best results this season - while behind them is Olympic Youth champion Zak Carrick-Smith - and Ryding thinks the team are proving they are \"100% investible again\".   \"I never looked back with 'what ifs' but, certainly, I'm out there to prove myself and to prove those people wrong, whether they deemed me unfundable,\" he said. \"I really want to prove them wrong, to keep trying to show that I am worthy and I am still capable of doing these great results even though I am 37 now.\" And how is even he managing that at 37? \"I don't really know, but I guess it's something in the Northern grit,\" said Ryding, who is from Chorley, Lancashire.  \"And just staying motivated, keeping on top of my body health-wise and I've done that for 20 years now, so maybe that's paying off more so than, say, other athletes that haven't taken care of themselves over the years as well as I have.\" Ryding, who has competed at four Winter Olympics, has previously said he wanted to \"shrivel up and cry\" if he thought about training for another Olympic cycle. But with less than two years before the Milan-Cortina 2026 Games, he strikes a very different note. \"I've got over the hump now of the Olympic cycle,\" he said. \"I've done two years, it's actually less than two years now to the Olympics. I'm still able to do seasons that are better than ever I've ever done before. \"If everything goes to plan, I'll be there.\" Why did we lose the roadside restaurant chain Little Chef?
