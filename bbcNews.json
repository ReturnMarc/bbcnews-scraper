        "description": "Europe has seen an increase in weekly cases of Covid-19 for the first time in months as restrictions are eased, the World Health Organization (WHO) says.\nIn 11 places, which include Armenia, Sweden, Moldova and North Macedonia, accelerated transmission has led to \"very significant resurgence\", said Regional Director Dr Hans Henri Kluge.\nHis warnings about the risk of resurgence had become reality, he said.\nIf left unchecked, he warned health systems would be \"pushed to the brink\".\nMore than 2.6 million cases of Covid-19 and 195,000 deaths have been reported in the WHO's European region, which is expansive, covering 54 countries and seven territories across Europe, the Middle East and Central Asia.\nAlmost 20,000 new cases and more than 700 new deaths are being recorded daily.\n\"For weeks, I have spoken about the risk of resurgence as countries adjust measures,\" Dr Kluge told a virtual news conference on Thursday. \n\"In several countries across Europe, this risk has now become a reality - 30 countries have seen increases in new cumulative cases over the past two weeks.\n\"In 11 of these countries, accelerated transmission has led to very significant resurgence that if left unchecked will push health systems to the brink once again.\"\nThe 11 countries and territories were later identified by the WHO as Armenia, Sweden, Moldova, North Macedonia, Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Albania, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Kyrgyzstan, Ukraine and Kosovo.\nDr Kluge said countries such as Poland, Germany, Spain and Israel had responded quickly to dangerous outbreaks associated with schools, coal mines, and food production settings, and brought them under control through rapid interventions.\nDespite warning about resurgences, he said the WHO anticipated that the situation would calm down further in the majority of countries over the summer.\n\"But we have indeed to prepare for the fall, when Covid-19 may meet seasonal influenza, pneumonia, other diseases as well, because ultimately the virus is still actively circulating in our communities and there is no effective treatment, no effective vaccine, yet.\"\nIn a separate development on Thursday, Germany and France pledged their support to the WHO after holding talks with its director general, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, in Geneva.\nGerman Health Minister Jens Spahn said his country planned to give more than €500m ($560; £451m) in money and equipment to the agency this year.\nHe stressed that global pandemics needed a global co-ordinated response, adding: \"Isolated national answers to international problems are doomed to fail.\"\nFrance's health minister, Olivier Veran, promised €50m in direct funding for the WHO and another €90m for its research centre in Lyon.\n\"I truly believe the world needs, more than ever, a multilateral organisation. I believe the world cannot get rid of partners,\" he said. \nEuropean leaders have been keen to show public support to the WHO after the US called the agency a \"puppet of China\" and said it would cut funding and leave.",

        "title": "Images 'show China structures' on India border",
        "description": "China has built new structures near the site of a Himalayan border clash that left 20 Indian troops dead earlier this month, fresh satellite images suggest.\nBunkers, tents and storage units for military hardware are visible in an area where last month there were none.\nFighting between the nuclear-armed powers over their disputed frontier has prompted alarm. Chinese casualties were also reported but not confirmed.\nThe latest images were published as the sides hold talks to defuse tensions. \nThe fresh satellite images, dated 22 June, are from space technology company Maxar. The structures which appear to have been built by China overlooking the Galwan River were not visible in aerial photographs earlier in June, Reuters reported.\nNeither India nor China has commented.\nThe clash in the Galwan Valley, in the disputed Himalayan territory of Ladakh, took place on 15 June, weeks after high-level military commanders from both nations agreed to \"peacefully resolve the situation in the border areas in accordance with various bilateral agreements.\" \nSince the clash, and amid spiralling rhetoric, the two nations have tried to publicly calm tensions. \nA statement released by the India's foreign ministry on Wednesday said that India's Foreign Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar and the Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi \"reaffirmed that both sides should sincerely implement the understanding on disengagement and de-escalation that was reached by the senior commanders on 6 June\".\nAjai Shukla, a leading Indian defence analyst, tweeted that \"there is a large Chinese camp in the Galwan Valley, 1.5km  into the Indian side of the LAC [Line of Actual Control]\".\nLocal media have also quoted sources in the Indian army as saying that the additional build-up by China seemed to have taken place between the 15 June clash and commander-level talks prior to that.\nSatellite imagery from May shows no structures in the disputed area near where the clashes took place. \nFormer Indian diplomat P Stobdan, an expert in Ladakh affairs, told the BBC the construction was \"worrying\".\n\"The [Indian] government has not released any pictures or made a statement, so it's hard to assess. But the images released by private firms show that the Chinese have built infrastructure and have not retreated,\" he said.\nThe clash presents Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi with one of his biggest foreign policy challenges as he faces accusations his government was ill-prepared. Last Friday he sought to downplay what happened, denying there had been any Chinese incursion into Indian territory. \nBut his comments were at odds with remarks from his foreign minister who had earlier accused China of seeking \"to erect a structure in Galwan Valley on our side of the LAC\".\nWhile the violence has been big news in India, it has been little discussed in China, and Beijing has given very little detail of what happened.\nDr Long Xingchun, president of the Chengdu Institute of World Affairs (CIWA) think tank, said he still thought the two sides would be able to reduce tensions.\n\"I don't know the details on the current border situation. But there is no mutual recognition of the Line of Actual Control. India's version of Line of Actual Control is not accepted by China and China doesn't accept the Indian version of the LAC,\" he told the BBC.\n\"I think the two countries can manage the situation and solve the problems peacefully.\"\nMedia reports said troops clashed on ridges at a height of nearly 4,300m (14,000 ft) on steep terrain, with some Indian soldiers falling into the fast-flowing Galwan river in sub-zero temperatures.\nAt least 76 Indian soldiers were reportedly injured in addition to the 20 dead. China has not released any information about Chinese casualties.\nThe fighting took place without any firearms because of a 1996 agreement barring guns and explosives from the area.\nThe situation in the region is described as still very tense.\nThe Line of Actual Control, as the disputed border between the two nations is known, is poorly demarcated. The presence of rivers, lakes and snowcaps means the line can shift. \nThe soldiers on either side - representing two of the world's largest armies - come face to face at many points. India has accused China of sending thousands of troops into Ladakh's Galwan valley and says China occupies 38,000sq km (14,700sq miles) of its territory. Several rounds of talks in the last three decades have failed to resolve the boundary disputes.\nThe two countries have fought only one war so far, in 1962, when India suffered a humiliating defeat.\nIn May, dozens of Indian and Chinese soldiers exchanged physical blows on the border in the north-eastern state of Sikkim. And in 2017, the two countries clashed in the region after China tried to extend a border road through a disputed plateau, Doklam.\nTensions have also risen over a road built by India in Ladakh.\nThere are several reasons why tensions are rising now - but competing strategic goals lie at the root, and both sides blame each other.\nIndia's new road in what experts say is the most remote and vulnerable area along the LAC in Ladakh. The road could boost Delhi's capability to move men and materiel rapidly in case of a conflict.\nAnalysts say India's decision to ramp up infrastructure seems to have infuriated Beijing.",

        "title": "Colorado to review black man's death in custody",
        "description": "Colorado is to re-examine the death of a young black man in police custody after growing outrage and a petition signed by more than two million people.\nGovernor Jared Polis said confidence in law enforcement was \"incredibly important now more than ever\".\nElijah McClain died after being put in a chokehold and injected with ketamine in Denver last year.\nHis case is among several to receive renewed attention following the death of George Floyd last month.\nMr Floyd's alleged murder by Minneapolis police has prompted a wave of demonstrations worldwide against police brutality and institutional racism.\nOn Thursday, New York police said an officer who appeared in footage to use a banned chokehold during an arrest in Queens on Sunday had been arrested and charged with strangulation. \nNew York police banned the chokeholds in 1993 and earlier this month Governor Andrew Cuomo signed legislation making their use a crime.\nIn a series of tweets, he said he had heard from many Coloradans who had \"expressed concerns with the investigation of Elijah McClain's death\".\n\"A fair and objective process free from real or perceived bias for investigating officer-involved killings is critical,\" he said.\n\"As a result, I have instructed my legal council to examine what the state can do and we are assessing next steps.\"\nNearly 2.7 million people have signed a petition demanding justice and calling for a more in-depth investigation be held. \nThe unarmed 23-year-old was walking in the Denver suburb of Aurora on 24 August last year when he was stopped by three white police officers. \nA district attorney report later said there had been an emergency call about a \"suspicious person\" matching his description.\nThere was a struggle after Mr McClain resisted contact with the officers, who wanted to search him to see if he was armed, the report says. On body cam footage Mr McClain can be heard saying, \"I'm an introvert, please respect my boundaries that I am speaking\".\nOne of the officers then says \"he is going for your gun\" and they wrestle him to the ground and put him in a chokehold. \nThe report says Mr McClain lost consciousness, was released from the chokehold and began to struggle again.\nThe officers called for assistance, with fire fighters and an ambulance responding. A fire medic injected Mr McClain with 500mg of the drug ketamine to sedate him.\nMr McClain was then put in \"soft restraints\" on a stretcher and put inside the ambulance. The medic who had administered the drug then noticed that Mr McClain's chest \"was not rising on its own, and he did not have a pulse\". He was declared brain dead on 27 August.\nMr McClain's family allege that the officers used excessive force for about 15 minutes as Mr McClain vomited, begged for them to stop and repeatedly told them he could not breathe. The officers also threatened to set a police dog on him, the family said.\nThe family's lawyer Mari Newman said footage of the incident showed that \"the police were nothing short of sadistic, brutalizing and terrorising a gentle, peaceful man as he lay there begging\".\nAn coroner's autopsy found the cause of death to be undetermined. \nMs Newman described him as an \"angel among humans\" who played his violin to animals at a shelter who were waiting to be adopted \"so they wouldn't be lonely\".\nHis mother Sheneen McClain wrote on a fundraising page that he \"brought joy to everyone who met him. The world is a darker place without him\".\nShe said he loved running because of the sense of freedom it gave him, enjoyed drawing and had taught himself to play the piano, guitar, cello and violin. \nHe was \"changing this world, one by one, wherever he went with acceptance of ourselves and what makes us happy\", she said.\nIn October, Mr McClain's family demanded an independent investigation and for the officers to face murder charges.\nBut in his November report, Adams County District Attorney Dave Young said he would not charge the officers. \n\"Based on the investigation presented and the applicable Colorado law, there is no reasonable likelihood of success of proving any state crimes beyond a reasonable doubt at trial,\" he said.\nIn January the city of Aurora launched an external investigation but earlier this month fired the lawyer leading it, a former police officer specialising in use of force cases, after concerns were raised about his neutrality. \nOfficials told US media they were now launching a new review of the case and were \"considering a panel of experts from across the country\".\nIn a statement to CBS news, McClain family lawyer Mari Newman said Aurora \"has no intention of taking responsibility for murdering an innocent young man. Its entire effort is to defend its brutality at all costs, and to lie to the public it is supposed to serve\".\nMeanwhile District Attorney Young this month told Colorado Politics he was \"not going to open up an investigation because people are signing a petition\".\nEarlier this month Aurora police banned the chokehold used on Mr McClain. New rules also say officers must intervene if they see a colleague using excessive force.",

        "title": "Pakistani pilots grounded over 'fake licences'",
        "description": "Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) has grounded 150 pilots over claims they may not hold a valid licence.\nPakistan's aviation minister told parliament on Wednesday that a large number of commercial pilots hold fake licences or cheated in exams. \nIt comes as an initial report into a PIA crash that killed 97 people last month found the cause to be human error by the pilot and air traffic control. \nPakistan has a chequered aviation safety record with a number of crashes. \nAviation minister Ghulam Sarwar Khan shared the findings of an initial report into May's crash on Wednesday, but also referred to a wider government probe, which had been launched after a different crash.\nFollowing the 2018 crash, it was discovered that the test date on the pilot's licence was a public holiday, suggesting that testing could not have taken place on that day.\nMr Khan said investigations had found that more than 260 of the country's 860 active pilots had either fake licences or had cheated in their exams. \nA PIA spokesman confirmed to AFP news agency that the probe found about 150 of its 434 pilots had \"either bogus or suspicious licences\". \n\"We have decided to ground those 150 pilots with bogus licences with immediate effect,\" he said.  \nSome flights may be cancelled as a result, the airline said. \nThe International Air Transport Association (IATA) said the irregularities found in pilot licences at the airline represent a \"serious lapse\" in safety controls. \nby Ilyas Khan, BBC News, Pakistan\nPakistan's aviation authorities have been probing allegations of PIA pilots' fake qualifications since 2018, but not much is known about it.\nSince 1965, PIA has suffered 10 major crashes and several minor incidents. Inquiries have been held but they don't seem to have led to any improvements.\nMany say the airline, which once played a major role in the launch of one the top Middle Eastern airlines, Emirates, has subsequently gone down the same path to institutional decay as the rest of the country.\nOver the years, both the PIA and the Civil Aviation Authority have come to be dominated by serving or retired officers of the Pakistan Air Force (PAF), prompting some to call it the retirement home for the military.\nPatronage politics has also led to large-scale recruitments, making it one of the most overstaffed airlines in the world.\nIn recent years, there have been frequent allegations of drug trafficking and smuggling involving PIA staffers, but in most cases there haven't been visible reprisals.\nMany feel a one-off blame on individual error or fake educational degrees will only help to keep the doors shut on transparency and prevent wider exposure of the vested interests that have brought PIA to where it is today.\nOn Wednesday, the aviation minister also gave more details on the preliminary report into a PIA plane crash on 22 May. Flight PK8303 came down on houses in Karachi. Only two passengers survived. \nWhat were the findings on the recent crash? \nOn Wednesday, Mr Khan told parliament that the pilot and air traffic control failed to follow protocol. The pilots were distracted, talking about coronavirus with each other as both of their families had been affected by the virus. \nHe said there was nothing wrong with the Airbus A320 aircraft, which had taken off from Lahore and was attempting to land in Karachi. \nMr Khan said the pilot initially failed to deploy the landing gear correctly, which led to the aircraft scraping the runway before then taking off again. As the plane was about to make a second landing, air traffic controllers failed to tell the pilot that the plane's engines had been left badly damaged. \n\"When the control tower asked him to increase the plane's height, the pilot said 'I'll manage'. There was over-confidence,\" Mr Khan said.\nHe said that a full report on the crash would be released in a year's time and will include details from a recording taken during the descent. \nMr Khan also vowed that PIA, a state-owned airline would be restructured and vowed that action would be taken against rogue pilots. \nPurported audio of the conversation between air traffic control and a pilot for the second attempt was published shortly after the crash by Pakistani media outlets, in which the pilot is heard saying the plane has \"lost engines\".\nAn air traffic controller asks whether it is going to carry out a \"belly landing\", to which the pilot replies \"mayday, mayday, mayday\" - the final communication from the plane.\nMuhammad Zubair, one of the two surviving passengers, said there were 10-15 minutes between the first attempt at landing and the crash. \"No-one was aware that the plane was about to crash; they were flying the plane in a smooth manner,\" he said.\nHe recalled how he lost consciousness during the sudden descent, then woke up to smoke and screaming. He managed to escape by walking towards light and jumping down about 10ft (3m) to safety. ",

        "description": "Country band Dixie Chicks have changed their name to The Chicks, to help highlight racial inequality in the US.\n\"Dixie\" was often used as a nickname for the southern states that made up the Confederate States of America during the US Civil War era.\nThe Texas trio revealed they'd dropped it on Thursday, while unveiling a protest song called March March.\nThey follow in the footsteps of US pop group Lady Antebellum, who changed their name earlier this month.\nAntebellum has similar connotations with the slavery-era.\nThe move allies the Not Make Nice singers, who have won 13 Grammy Awards, with the anti-racism movement that has gathered momentum in the wake of the death of George Floyd - a black American, who died while in the custody of a white police officer.\nIt comes a week after Variety writer Jeremy Helligar questioned the acceptability of the name in 2020.\n\"The Dixie Chicks don't need to change their name to get that kind of publicity,\" he wrote, referring to the widespread reports about the newly-named Lady A, \"but their silence has been deafening.\"\n\"This is a discussion we need to have, and they should be a part of it,\" he added.\nThe term Dixie, or Dixieland, which was also sung about in Elvis's epic American Trilogy, derives from the states around the Mason-Dixon line.\nIn a statement obtained by Pitchfork The Chicks offered \"a sincere and heartfelt thank you\" to a pre-existing New Zealand band, who were already operating under that name, for allowing them to share it.\n\"We are honoured to co-exist together in the world with these exceptionally talented sisters,\" they said.\nThe band have previously used their platform to make a political point, telling a London crowd in 2003 that they did not support the US's invasion of Iraq.\nNatalie Maines from the band said they were \"ashamed\" of then-US President George W Bush being from Texas.\nFollow us on Facebook or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

        "title": "Pakistani pilots grounded over 'fake licences'",
        "description": "Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) has grounded 150 pilots over claims they may not hold a valid licence.\nPakistan's aviation minister told parliament on Wednesday that a large number of commercial pilots hold fake licences or cheated in exams. \nIt comes as an initial report into a PIA crash that killed 97 people last month found the cause to be human error by the pilot and air traffic control. \nPakistan has a chequered aviation safety record with a number of crashes. \nAviation minister Ghulam Sarwar Khan shared the findings of an initial report into May's crash on Wednesday, but also referred to a wider government probe, which had been launched after a different crash.\nFollowing the 2018 crash, it was discovered that the test date on the pilot's licence was a public holiday, suggesting that testing could not have taken place on that day.\nMr Khan said investigations had found that more than 260 of the country's 860 active pilots had either fake licences or had cheated in their exams. \nA PIA spokesman confirmed to AFP news agency that the probe found about 150 of its 434 pilots had \"either bogus or suspicious licences\". \n\"We have decided to ground those 150 pilots with bogus licences with immediate effect,\" he said.  \nSome flights may be cancelled as a result, the airline said. \nThe International Air Transport Association (IATA) said the irregularities found in pilot licences at the airline represent a \"serious lapse\" in safety controls. \nby Ilyas Khan, BBC News, Pakistan\nPakistan's aviation authorities have been probing allegations of PIA pilots' fake qualifications since 2018, but not much is known about it.\nSince 1965, PIA has suffered 10 major crashes and several minor incidents. Inquiries have been held but they don't seem to have led to any improvements.\nMany say the airline, which once played a major role in the launch of one the top Middle Eastern airlines, Emirates, has subsequently gone down the same path to institutional decay as the rest of the country.\nOver the years, both the PIA and the Civil Aviation Authority have come to be dominated by serving or retired officers of the Pakistan Air Force (PAF), prompting some to call it the retirement home for the military.\nPatronage politics has also led to large-scale recruitments, making it one of the most overstaffed airlines in the world.\nIn recent years, there have been frequent allegations of drug trafficking and smuggling involving PIA staffers, but in most cases there haven't been visible reprisals.\nMany feel a one-off blame on individual error or fake educational degrees will only help to keep the doors shut on transparency and prevent wider exposure of the vested interests that have brought PIA to where it is today.\nOn Wednesday, the aviation minister also gave more details on the preliminary report into a PIA plane crash on 22 May. Flight PK8303 came down on houses in Karachi. Only two passengers survived. \nWhat were the findings on the recent crash? \nOn Wednesday, Mr Khan told parliament that the pilot and air traffic control failed to follow protocol. The pilots were distracted, talking about coronavirus with each other as both of their families had been affected by the virus. \nHe said there was nothing wrong with the Airbus A320 aircraft, which had taken off from Lahore and was attempting to land in Karachi. \nMr Khan said the pilot initially failed to deploy the landing gear correctly, which led to the aircraft scraping the runway before then taking off again. As the plane was about to make a second landing, air traffic controllers failed to tell the pilot that the plane's engines had been left badly damaged. \n\"When the control tower asked him to increase the plane's height, the pilot said 'I'll manage'. There was over-confidence,\" Mr Khan said.\nHe said that a full report on the crash would be released in a year's time and will include details from a recording taken during the descent. \nMr Khan also vowed that PIA, a state-owned airline would be restructured and vowed that action would be taken against rogue pilots. \nPurported audio of the conversation between air traffic control and a pilot for the second attempt was published shortly after the crash by Pakistani media outlets, in which the pilot is heard saying the plane has \"lost engines\".\nAn air traffic controller asks whether it is going to carry out a \"belly landing\", to which the pilot replies \"mayday, mayday, mayday\" - the final communication from the plane.\nMuhammad Zubair, one of the two surviving passengers, said there were 10-15 minutes between the first attempt at landing and the crash. \"No-one was aware that the plane was about to crash; they were flying the plane in a smooth manner,\" he said.\nHe recalled how he lost consciousness during the sudden descent, then woke up to smoke and screaming. He managed to escape by walking towards light and jumping down about 10ft (3m) to safety. ",

        "description": "Country band Dixie Chicks have changed their name to The Chicks, to help highlight racial inequality in the US.\n\"Dixie\" was often used as a nickname for the southern states that made up the Confederate States of America during the US Civil War era.\nThe Texas trio revealed they'd dropped it on Thursday, while unveiling a protest song called March March.\nThey follow in the footsteps of US pop group Lady Antebellum, who changed their name earlier this month.\nAntebellum has similar connotations with the slavery-era.\nThe move allies the Not Make Nice singers, who have won 13 Grammy Awards, with the anti-racism movement that has gathered momentum in the wake of the death of George Floyd - a black American, who died while in the custody of a white police officer.\nIt comes a week after Variety writer Jeremy Helligar questioned the acceptability of the name in 2020.\n\"The Dixie Chicks don't need to change their name to get that kind of publicity,\" he wrote, referring to the widespread reports about the newly-named Lady A, \"but their silence has been deafening.\"\n\"This is a discussion we need to have, and they should be a part of it,\" he added.\nThe term Dixie, or Dixieland, which was also sung about in Elvis's epic American Trilogy, derives from the states around the Mason-Dixon line.\nIn a statement obtained by Pitchfork The Chicks offered \"a sincere and heartfelt thank you\" to a pre-existing New Zealand band, who were already operating under that name, for allowing them to share it.\n\"We are honoured to co-exist together in the world with these exceptionally talented sisters,\" they said.\nThe band have previously used their platform to make a political point, telling a London crowd in 2003 that they did not support the US's invasion of Iraq.\nNatalie Maines from the band said they were \"ashamed\" of then-US President George W Bush being from Texas.\nFollow us on Facebook or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

        "title": "'Very significant' Europe resurgences alarm WHO",
        "description": "Europe has seen an increase in weekly cases of Covid-19 for the first time in months as restrictions are eased, the World Health Organization (WHO) says.\nIn 11 places, which include Armenia, Sweden, Moldova and North Macedonia, accelerated transmission has led to \"very significant resurgence\", said Regional Director Dr Hans Henri Kluge.\nHis warnings about the risk of resurgence had become reality, he said.\nIf left unchecked, he warned health systems would be \"pushed to the brink\".\nMore than 2.6 million cases of Covid-19 and 195,000 deaths have been reported in the WHO's European region, which is expansive, covering 54 countries and seven territories across Europe, the Middle East and Central Asia.\nAlmost 20,000 new cases and more than 700 new deaths are being recorded daily.\n\"For weeks, I have spoken about the risk of resurgence as countries adjust measures,\" Dr Kluge told a virtual news conference on Thursday. \n\"In several countries across Europe, this risk has now become a reality - 30 countries have seen increases in new cumulative cases over the past two weeks.\n\"In 11 of these countries, accelerated transmission has led to very significant resurgence that if left unchecked will push health systems to the brink once again.\"\nThe 11 countries and territories were later identified by the WHO as Armenia, Sweden, Moldova, North Macedonia, Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Albania, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Kyrgyzstan, Ukraine and Kosovo.\nDr Kluge said countries such as Poland, Germany, Spain and Israel had responded quickly to dangerous outbreaks associated with schools, coal mines, and food production settings, and brought them under control through rapid interventions.\nDespite warning about resurgences, he said the WHO anticipated that the situation would calm down further in the majority of countries over the summer.\n\"But we have indeed to prepare for the fall, when Covid-19 may meet seasonal influenza, pneumonia, other diseases as well, because ultimately the virus is still actively circulating in our communities and there is no effective treatment, no effective vaccine, yet.\"\nIn a separate development on Thursday, Germany and France pledged their support to the WHO after holding talks with its director general, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, in Geneva.\nGerman Health Minister Jens Spahn said his country planned to give more than €500m ($560; £451m) in money and equipment to the agency this year.\nHe stressed that global pandemics needed a global co-ordinated response, adding: \"Isolated national answers to international problems are doomed to fail.\"\nFrance's health minister, Olivier Veran, promised €50m in direct funding for the WHO and another €90m for its research centre in Lyon.\n\"I truly believe the world needs, more than ever, a multilateral organisation. I believe the world cannot get rid of partners,\" he said. \nEuropean leaders have been keen to show public support to the WHO after the US called the agency a \"puppet of China\" and said it would cut funding and leave.",

        "title": "Images 'show China structures' on India border",
        "description": "China has built new structures near the site of a Himalayan border clash that left 20 Indian troops dead earlier this month, fresh satellite images suggest.\nBunkers, tents and storage units for military hardware are visible in an area where last month there were none.\nFighting between the nuclear-armed powers over their disputed frontier has prompted alarm. Chinese casualties were also reported but not confirmed.\nThe latest images were published as the sides hold talks to defuse tensions. \nThe fresh satellite images, dated 22 June, are from space technology company Maxar. The structures which appear to have been built by China overlooking the Galwan River were not visible in aerial photographs earlier in June, Reuters reported.\nNeither India nor China has commented.\nThe clash in the Galwan Valley, in the disputed Himalayan territory of Ladakh, took place on 15 June, weeks after high-level military commanders from both nations agreed to \"peacefully resolve the situation in the border areas in accordance with various bilateral agreements.\" \nSince the clash, and amid spiralling rhetoric, the two nations have tried to publicly calm tensions. \nA statement released by the India's foreign ministry on Wednesday said that India's Foreign Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar and the Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi \"reaffirmed that both sides should sincerely implement the understanding on disengagement and de-escalation that was reached by the senior commanders on 6 June\".\nAjai Shukla, a leading Indian defence analyst, tweeted that \"there is a large Chinese camp in the Galwan Valley, 1.5km  into the Indian side of the LAC [Line of Actual Control]\".\nLocal media have also quoted sources in the Indian army as saying that the additional build-up by China seemed to have taken place between the 15 June clash and commander-level talks prior to that.\nSatellite imagery from May shows no structures in the disputed area near where the clashes took place. \nFormer Indian diplomat P Stobdan, an expert in Ladakh affairs, told the BBC the construction was \"worrying\".\n\"The [Indian] government has not released any pictures or made a statement, so it's hard to assess. But the images released by private firms show that the Chinese have built infrastructure and have not retreated,\" he said.\nThe clash presents Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi with one of his biggest foreign policy challenges as he faces accusations his government was ill-prepared. Last Friday he sought to downplay what happened, denying there had been any Chinese incursion into Indian territory. \nBut his comments were at odds with remarks from his foreign minister who had earlier accused China of seeking \"to erect a structure in Galwan Valley on our side of the LAC\".\nWhile the violence has been big news in India, it has been little discussed in China, and Beijing has given very little detail of what happened.\nDr Long Xingchun, president of the Chengdu Institute of World Affairs (CIWA) think tank, said he still thought the two sides would be able to reduce tensions.\n\"I don't know the details on the current border situation. But there is no mutual recognition of the Line of Actual Control. India's version of Line of Actual Control is not accepted by China and China doesn't accept the Indian version of the LAC,\" he told the BBC.\n\"I think the two countries can manage the situation and solve the problems peacefully.\"\nMedia reports said troops clashed on ridges at a height of nearly 4,300m (14,000 ft) on steep terrain, with some Indian soldiers falling into the fast-flowing Galwan river in sub-zero temperatures.\nAt least 76 Indian soldiers were reportedly injured in addition to the 20 dead. China has not released any information about Chinese casualties.\nThe fighting took place without any firearms because of a 1996 agreement barring guns and explosives from the area.\nThe situation in the region is described as still very tense.\nThe Line of Actual Control, as the disputed border between the two nations is known, is poorly demarcated. The presence of rivers, lakes and snowcaps means the line can shift. \nThe soldiers on either side - representing two of the world's largest armies - come face to face at many points. India has accused China of sending thousands of troops into Ladakh's Galwan valley and says China occupies 38,000sq km (14,700sq miles) of its territory. Several rounds of talks in the last three decades have failed to resolve the boundary disputes.\nThe two countries have fought only one war so far, in 1962, when India suffered a humiliating defeat.\nIn May, dozens of Indian and Chinese soldiers exchanged physical blows on the border in the north-eastern state of Sikkim. And in 2017, the two countries clashed in the region after China tried to extend a border road through a disputed plateau, Doklam.\nTensions have also risen over a road built by India in Ladakh.\nThere are several reasons why tensions are rising now - but competing strategic goals lie at the root, and both sides blame each other.\nIndia's new road in what experts say is the most remote and vulnerable area along the LAC in Ladakh. The road could boost Delhi's capability to move men and materiel rapidly in case of a conflict.\nAnalysts say India's decision to ramp up infrastructure seems to have infuriated Beijing.",

Inquiries have been held but they don't seem to have led to any improvements.\nMany say the airline, which once played a major role in the launch of one the top Middle Eastern airlines, Emirates, has subsequently gone down the same path to institutional decay as the rest of the country.\nOver the years, both the PIA and the Civil Aviation Authority have come to be dominated by serving or retired officers of the Pakistan Air Force (PAF), prompting some to call it the retirement home for the military.\nPatronage politics has also led to large-scale recruitments, making it one of the most overstaffed airlines in the world.\nIn recent years, there have been frequent allegations of drug trafficking and smuggling involving PIA staffers, but in most cases there haven't been visible reprisals.\nMany feel a one-off blame on individual error or fake educational degrees will only help to keep the doors shut on transparency and prevent wider exposure of the vested interests that have brought PIA to where it is today.\nOn Wednesday, the aviation minister also gave more details on the preliminary report into a PIA plane crash on 22 May. Flight PK8303 came down on houses in Karachi. Only two passengers survived. \nWhat were the findings on the recent crash? \nOn Wednesday, Mr Khan told parliament that the pilot and air traffic control failed to follow protocol. The pilots were distracted, talking about coronavirus with each other as both of their families had been affected by the virus. \nHe said there was nothing wrong with the Airbus A320 aircraft, which had taken off from Lahore and was attempting to land in Karachi. \nMr Khan said the pilot initially failed to deploy the landing gear correctly, which led to the aircraft scraping the runway before then taking off again. As the plane was about to make a second landing, air traffic controllers failed to tell the pilot that the plane's engines had been left badly damaged. \n\"When the control tower asked him to increase the plane's height, the pilot said 'I'll manage'. There was over-confidence,\" Mr Khan said.\nHe said that a full report on the crash would be released in a year's time and will include details from a recording taken during the descent. \nMr Khan also vowed that PIA, a state-owned airline would be restructured and vowed that action would be taken against rogue pilots. \nPurported audio of the conversation between air traffic control and a pilot for the second attempt was published shortly after the crash by Pakistani media outlets, in which the pilot is heard saying the plane has \"lost engines\".\nAn air traffic controller asks whether it is going to carry out a \"belly landing\", to which the pilot replies \"mayday, mayday, mayday\" - the final communication from the plane.\nMuhammad Zubair, one of the two surviving passengers, said there were 10-15 minutes between the first attempt at landing and the crash. \"No-one was aware that the plane was about to crash; they were flying the plane in a smooth manner,\" he said.\nHe recalled how he lost consciousness during the sudden descent, then woke up to smoke and screaming. He managed to escape by walking towards light and jumping down about 10ft (3m) to safety. ",

        "description": "Country band Dixie Chicks have changed their name to The Chicks, to help highlight racial inequality in the US.\n\"Dixie\" was often used as a nickname for the southern states that made up the Confederate States of America during the US Civil War era.\nThe Texas trio revealed they'd dropped it on Thursday, while unveiling a protest song called March March.\nThey follow in the footsteps of US pop group Lady Antebellum, who changed their name earlier this month.\nAntebellum has similar connotations with the slavery-era.\nThe move allies the Not Make Nice singers, who have won 13 Grammy Awards, with the anti-racism movement that has gathered momentum in the wake of the death of George Floyd - a black American, who died while in the custody of a white police officer.\nIt comes a week after Variety writer Jeremy Helligar questioned the acceptability of the name in 2020.\n\"The Dixie Chicks don't need to change their name to get that kind of publicity,\" he wrote, referring to the widespread reports about the newly-named Lady A, \"but their silence has been deafening.\"\n\"This is a discussion we need to have, and they should be a part of it,\" he added.\nThe term Dixie, or Dixieland, which was also sung about in Elvis's epic American Trilogy, derives from the states around the Mason-Dixon line.\nIn a statement obtained by Pitchfork The Chicks offered \"a sincere and heartfelt thank you\" to a pre-existing New Zealand band, who were already operating under that name, for allowing them to share it.\n\"We are honoured to co-exist together in the world with these exceptionally talented sisters,\" they said.\nThe band have previously used their platform to make a political point, telling a London crowd in 2003 that they did not support the US's invasion of Iraq.\nNatalie Maines from the band said they were \"ashamed\" of then-US President George W Bush being from Texas.\nFollow us on Facebook or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

        "description": "A huge cloud of Saharan dust has darkened the skies over parts of the Caribbean.\nThe dust has been moving from Africa over the Atlantic Ocean.\nOn Sunday it reached Puerto Rico and has since covered Cuba and parts of Mexico.\nThe Caribbean islands of Guadeloupe and Martinique are suffering their worst haze for at least a decade, and health officials in Cuba are warning it could increase respiratory problems.\nThe dust cloud is also affecting parts of southern Florida, including the city of Miami.\n Analysis by BBC Weather presenter Simon King\nDust and sandstorms are not uncommon in the desert regions of the world.  Winds can whip the dust - up to 2,000 million tonnes every year - high up into our atmosphere and it gets transported many miles away from the source.\nThe dust and sand provide a source of nutrients for ocean ecosystems but can also affect the weather and the health of humans with respiratory problems.\nDust coming off the Sahara into the Atlantic is a common occurrence and is known as the Dry Air Saharan Layer.   Later in the hurricane season it can inhibit the growth of tropical storms developing around Cape Verde and the mid-Atlantic.\nOver the last week however we've had an unusually large area of dust travelling right across the Atlantic affecting Central and North America. This is going to hang around over the weekend.  Meanwhile another large area of dust has been seen on satellite images moving out of the Sahara and travelling across the Atlantic.\nPoor visibility and air quality is forecast to continue in parts of the Caribbean and Central America over the coming week.\nOn Sunday, it was the Venezuelan capital, Caracas, which saw its hillside neighbourhoods shrouded in haze.\nTourists in San Juan in Puerto Rico got more sand than they had bargained for on Monday.\nBridgetown in Barbados also appeared blanketed in the yellow dust on Monday.\nIn Cuba, people stopped to take photographs of the yellow-coloured sky on Wednesday.\nCuban health officials warned residents that those suffering from asthma and other respiratory problems could see their conditions worsen.\nCuban meteorologist José Rubiera said that while Saharan dust clouds were not unusual, the density of the current one was \"well above normal levels\".\nAll photos subject to copyright.",

        "title": "Unilever drops 'fair' from skin cream after backlash",
        "description": "Unilever will rename Fair & Lovely, a skin-lightening cream which has been criticised for promoting negative stereotypes around dark skin tones.\nIt will also remove references to \"whitening\" or \"lightening\" on the products, which are sold across Asia.\nUnilever acknowledged the branding suggests \"a singular ideal of beauty\".\nTwo separate petitions urging Unilever to stop the production of its Fair & Lovely range have been signed by more than 18,000 people in recent weeks.\n\"This product has built upon, perpetuated and benefited from internalised racism and promotes anti-blackness sentiments,\" one says.\nA second petition claimed the cream \"tells us that there is something wrong with our color, that we have to be light in order to feel beautiful. In order to feel worthy.\"\nSunny Jain, President of Beauty & Personal Care at Unilever, said: \"We are fully committed to having a global portfolio of skin care brands that is inclusive and cares for all skin tones, celebrating greater diversity of beauty. \n\"We recognise that the use of the words 'fair', 'white' and 'light' suggest a singular ideal of beauty that we don't think is right, and we want to address this.\"\n\"The brand has never been and is not a bleaching product,\" Unilever added.\nThe consumer goods giant also said that it had removed before-and-after impressions and \"shade guides\" on Fair & Lovely packaging in 2019. The skin care range is sold across countries such as India, Indonesia, Thailand and Pakistan.\nUnilever's move comes as cosmetics firms around the world reassess their product lines and marketing strategies in light of the Black Lives Matters movement, sparked by George Floyd's death.\nGeorge Floyd died in Minneapolis in May as a white police officer held a knee on his neck for nearly nine minutes.\nThe final moments were filmed on phones. Four police officers involved have been sacked and charged over his death.\nWriter and activist Poorna Bell said that Unilever's announcement was \"hugely disappointing\".\n\"It doesn't do enough to make reparations for the untold mental and emotional damage done by colourism,\" a prejudice or discrimination against individuals with a dark skin tone, often among people of the same ethnic group.\n\"Renaming the products doesn't mean anything - that's still just colourism by another word,\" she said.\nShe also called for Unilever to match Johnson & Johnson's recent commitment to stop selling certain products that are advertised as dark-spot reducers in Asia and the Middle East, but have been used by consumers to lighten skin tone.\nSkin-lightening products are typically aimed at women in the Black and Asian communities, says Dr Steve Garner, a sociologist, who carried out one of the first British studies into skin-lightening.\nNivea's parent company Beiersdorf told the BBC that it \"stands against racism and discrimination of any kind and supports the Black Lives Matter movement.\"\nNivea's Natural Fairness line is sold in the Middle East, India as well as Nigeria and Ghana.\nOn its Middle East website, the product is described as being able to \"prevent the darkening of skin tone\". \nWhen asked by the BBC if it would amend the description, Nivea said that the product contains SPF-15 \"which helps prevent sun-induced skin damage, such as irregular dark pigmentation, for any skin type.\"\nIt added: \"We are currently doing a review in all our products descriptions and are in the process of re-evaluating and updating the description that may cause any misinterpretation.\"\nL'Oreal did not respond to the BBC's request for comment on its Garnier White Complete range.\nIn a YouTube video advertising the range, cartoon images of women are put side-by-side, claiming that the products can \"brighten\"  the skin.\n\"The language around these products upholds the beauty standards that lighter or whiter skin is more desirable,\" Nomshado Michelle Baca, the founder of beauty brand A Complexion Company.\n\"The individual who formulated and marketed the products is not likely to be a person of colour, resulting in a warped perception that all black women desire lighter skin.\"\nBut she argues that the conversation has become \"hyper-focused on the change of someone's entire complexion. \n\"The woman who wants to treat small areas of scarring is left invisible and without options but to use the damaging products available in unregulated retailers or black hair shops.\"\nUnless they are issued on prescription by a doctor, creams containing hydroquinone, steroids or mercury are banned in the UK - because of their potentially serious side-effects.\nConsumers have previously been warned by the Local Government Association to steer clear of those toxic products that can \"act like paint stripper\".\nBBC News identified products containing the bleaching agent hydroquinone available to UK customers on online marketplace EBay.\nA spokesperson for EBay told the BBC: \"Only items that comply with the law are allowed to be listed on eBay and any products containing hydroquinone, steroids or mercury are banned. \n\"Listings containing these ingredients were immediately removed and we are taking enforcement action against the sellers. We work closely with regulatory authorities including Trading Standards and the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency to keep our community safe.\"\nThey added that EBay has been updating its \"offensive materials policy\" in recent weeks in light of the Black Lives Matter movement.\n\"In the bigger picture, companies should have been doing these things, such as weeding out potentially poisonous products, a long time ago,\" Dr Steve Garner added.\n\"Realistically, these commitments will have very little impact for a global company.\"",

        "title": "DR Congo's deadliest Ebola outbreak declared over",
        "description": "The worst-ever outbreak of Ebola in the Democratic Republic of Congo has officially been declared over, almost two years after it began.\nNo new cases of the disease have been reported in the north-east of the country, where dozens of armed groups operate, since 27 April.\nSome 2,280 people died since the outbreak began in August 2018.\nThe deadliest outbreak on record was in West Africa between 2014 and 2016 with more than 11,000 deaths.\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) said the end of the outbreak in the east, where insecurity is also endemic, was a cause for celebration as it had a been a tough and often dangerous two years for those involved in fighting it.\nHowever, DR Congo, which is the size of mainland western Europe, is dealing a fresh Ebola outbreak in the north-west of the country. \nThe case in Mbandaka was announced on 1 June where 13 people have since died. Genetic analysis shows it is a different strain of the virus to that found in the east. \nThe WHO in DR Congo has told the BBC the situation in Mbandaka - the country's 11th outbreak - is nearly under control.\nBut new Ebola outbreaks are to be expected given the existence of the virus in animals in many parts of DR Congo, the WHO says.\nFor an outbreak to be declared over, there has to be a 42-day period since the last positive case was tested negative and discharged from hospital.\nThe outbreak in eastern DR Congo was the 10th to have hit the country since 1976, when the virus was first discovered by a group of scientists who decided to call it Ebola after a local river. \nHealth Minister Eteni Longondo described it as \"the longest, most complex and deadliest\" in the DR Congo's history.\nDecades of conflict in the east have led to widespread mistrust of the authorities, which has made it harder for health workers to treat sick and at-risk people. \nBBC health reporter Rhoda Odhiambo says there had been more than 420 attacks on health facilities in the region by armed groups since 2018, which greatly hampered efforts to contain the spread of the disease. \nAnother challenge in tackling the eastern outbreak was its geographical span across 1200km (475 miles) and three provinces - North Kivu, Ituri and South Kivu, she says.\nFear of the deadly Ebola virus - which sees patients suffer gruesome symptoms and rules out customary burial rites - has been another challenge.\nWHO's regional director to Africa says the end of the outbreak was only possible because of collaboration.\n\"This is a sign of hope that with solidarity and science epidemics can be controlled,\" Dr Matshidiso Moeti said.\nThe largest-ever Ebola vaccine campaign was a key factor in containing its spread.\nThe introduction of two experimental vaccines saw more than 320,000 people inoculated.\nHealth workers and Congolese authorities have mostly succeeded in preventing the spread to  neighbouring countries.\nIn Uganda last year, a five-year-old boy and his grandmother died days after visiting family across the border in DR Congo.\nMonths later, Tanzania was criticised by the WHO for failing to provide information about suspected Ebola infections, including one person who died.\nFrom Ebola survivor to trainee doctor",

        "title": "Travelling road to Israeli annexation in West Bank",
        "description": "Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu could annex parts of the occupied West Bank this summer. He says the move, stemming from US President Donald Trump's peace plan, will write another \"glorious chapter in the history of Zionism\". \nThe Palestinians are defiant. They say they are pulling out of previous agreements, risking their own fragile governing authority. To them, the move means the loss of vital land for a future state and a death blow to dreams of self-determination.  \nMuch of the global community looks on with growing concern over what they see as a clear violation of international law, while warnings echo of a \"hot summer\" of boiling tensions.  \nHow is the groundwork being laid ahead of what is potentially one of the most significant policy moves in the region in years?\nMy journey starts along the main highway heading south out of Jerusalem.  \nThe road is named after Menachem Begin, the former Jewish militant leader who became Israel's sixth prime minister. He is an icon of right-wing nationalism, founding the movement that later merged to become Likud - the party now led by Benjamin Netanyahu.\nThe highway ramp dips past a 12-storey building covered in a giant poster of Mr Netanyahu and President Trump. \"No to a Palestinian state!\" it proclaims in Hebrew. \"Sovereignty - do it right!\"\nIt's a message for, not by, the current Israeli and US leaders. It's from a group of mayors of Jewish settlements in the West Bank - the territory they see as their Biblical heartland.  \nThe mayors want to claim Israeli sovereignty over more than the 30% of the West Bank that is on the table from Mr Trump. With Mr Netanyahu soon able to bring proposals to his cabinet or parliament to \"apply Israeli law\" to parts of the territory, the mayors are giving him a headache from his political right.\nIt's a sign of how the argument has shifted in Israel over the years.\nI drive on, leaving the Begin Highway behind, passing a military checkpoint and joining a smaller road that winds its way into the West Bank, home to up to three million Palestinians, and to almost half a million Israelis living in settlements. \nAmong grapevines and olive trees, Mohammed Yehya Ayer shows me his land.  \nWe're on a ridge outside the Palestinian village of Irtas. Some of the West Bank's familiar colour codes are on display. Orange rooftops curve across a hilltop to the south-west - the neat suburban layout of the Israeli settlement of Efrat.  \nBeyond its fenced-off edges the land sweeps down into an empty valley, a dusty gulf of burnt ochre and rocks, before the habitation picks up again - the grey concrete blocks of Dheisheh, a sprawling urban refugee camp on the edge of the Palestinian city of Bethlehem.  \nTwo separated worlds, side by side. \nI ask Mohammed what he thinks of Mr Netanyahu's recent statements.  \n\"It doesn't mean anything,\" he tells me. \"These areas are already [as good as] annexed... It's all in their hands.\" \nMohammed goes on to explain his view. \nHis family farmed the land here for generations. After Efrat settlement was established in the 1980s, things began to change. He describes a frequent struggle over control.  \n\"If I put 10 bricks here [to build a structure], the Israeli authorities come and demolish them,\" he says.\n\"Israelis... make suggestions and seize more lands on the pretext they are state land... and the government helps the settlers.\"  \nIsrael is planning a new settlement, called Givat Eitam, north-east of where I walk with Mohammed. It would be considered a neighbourhood of Efrat. Mohammed's land is within an area sandwiched between the two settlements. \n\"If Efrat builds there by force, they might install gates and fences and not allow us to cross our lands,\" he says. \"They would tell us to get special permits and approvals.\"\nThe Israeli authorities routinely point out that fence routes can be challenged in the planning process or the courts. They declined to comment on the specific claim about access if Givat Eitam goes ahead. \nJudges are due to rule on an appeal against the land allocation for the settlement itself. \nI put it to Mohammed that the Trump plan envisages the Palestinians having a state on 70% of the West Bank and a freeze on settlement expansion for four years in places outside of Israeli-annexed areas.\nThis is what a future State of Palestine can look like, with a capital in parts of East Jerusalem. pic.twitter.com/39vw3pPrAL\nEnd of Twitter post  by @realDonaldTrump\nHe handles a freshly picked peach. \n\"Who is Trump to promise anything? Is this property owned by him?\" he asks holding up his fruit. \"I can give this peach to you because I own it. But if I don't have it, how could I offer it to you?\"\nIt's not far to Efrat. But the journey shows the West Bank's sharp contrasts. \nBefore a watchtower, concrete stumps alongside a dust road mark out a future line to extend Israel's network of walls, fences and checkpoints - the separation barrier.  \nIts construction began during the second Palestinian intifada, or uprising, of 2000-2005, when suicide bombings frequently killed Israelis and Israel launched sweeping incursions into West Bank cities. \nIsrael says the barrier saves lives. Critics call it a device to grab land. \nThe settlements are seen as illegal under international law, stemming from the prohibition on countries transferring part of their populations to areas under military occupation. Israel rejects this, arguing the territory is \"disputed\" rather than occupied.   \nAn armed guard waves me past a checkpoint into Efrat's quiet streets. \nThe Trump plan is a big break from previous peace proposals. Some speculate that these could have led to Israel formally gaining the big settlement blocs - including the bloc containing Efrat, for example - as part of a negotiated deal with the Palestinians, who want the West Bank as part of their future state. \nMost of the big settlement blocs are just across the Green Line, the armistice line from before the 1967 Arab-Israeli war, when Israel captured the West Bank from Jordanian control.  \nBut President Trump's plan potentially awards American recognition to Israel for all the settlements and the strategically vital Jordan Valley - before any negotiations with the Palestinians. \nOutside a waffle bar, I chat to Yedidia Mosawi and Sharon Barazani, both in their 20s. \nYedidia tells me he works in security and comes from a settlement further south, near Hebron. \n\"It's an amazing place, very important for Israel,\" he says of the West Bank - or the Hebrew Biblical name of Judea and Samaria, as many Israelis refer to it.  \nI ask about Mr Netanyahu's plans. He suggests it's not enough. \n\"[We should] apply Israeli law to all of this land. It's ours in history. For the Jewish people it's the most important - we don't have another country to go to.\" \nSharon adds: \"You can't tell people to go from their land, their home.\"\nI arrive at the mayor's office. Outside is a picture of a floor mosaic found in Jordan in the 1880s.\nIt is known as the Madaba map, a portrayal of the Holy Land in the 6th Century. One of its Greek inscriptions, next to Bethlehem, references the Biblical location of Ephratah.  \nThe Israeli settlement of Efrat was established in 1983. Mayor Oded Revivi is well aware of the religious and ideological connections to the land, although he says it is not the main driving force for most settlers.  \nMany, as he did in the 1990s, come for potentially cheaper homes in a ready formed Jewish community. \nMr Revivi talks to Mr Netanyahu. He knows members of the American-Israeli mapping team charged with working out the territorial boundaries of annexation, and he backed the Trump plan from the start. \n\"I thought it was a genuine attempt to try and think of another way to solve the conflict,\" he says. \nWhat of his fellow mayors attacking the prime minister from the right, claiming Israeli rights to even more of the West Bank? Mr Revivi jabs at some of his colleagues politely.  \n\"Such an attitude derives from not quite understanding the global village we live in,\" he says, referring to the strong counter-views of much of the outside world to any annexation.  \n\"That we can think we are strong and mighty, and that God is on our side, and we can do whatever we want.\"\nYou need to understand the Trump deal in stages, he says. \"This is stage one.\" \nOpponents see the Trump plan as nothing more than a way to formalise a de-facto reality developed on the ground for half a century in breach of international law. \nI arrive in the shadow of a huge bridge being constructed - a doubling of the road running from the Begin Highway that forges its way into the West Bank, connecting Jerusalem to Efrat and the other settlements further south.\nWe stand a few metres from a section of the separation barrier - an 8m-high (26ft) concrete wall here that conceals from our view Palestinian homes on the other side, as cars bearing Israeli number plates zoom across the bridge above us.\nThis is the \"whole story of the West Bank in the last 53 years\", according to Dror Etkes, who runs the Israeli non-governmental organisation Kerem Navot (Navot's Vineyard - named after a Biblical figure murdered for his land), which monitors settlement construction.  \n\"It's about taking from the Palestinians and giving to the Israelis. The way you do it is confiscating land and allocating only to Israelis. That's one. And the other is sealing up and preventing the expansion of Palestinian communities,\" he says.  \nWe watch Eastern European workers carry huge steel beams. \nMr Etkes says this is the biggest boom in infrastructure projects carried out by Israel in the West Bank in two decades.\nMore roads, water pipelines and sewage purification systems are being built, he says, to allow for significant future growth in settler numbers. \nMr Etkes and other monitoring groups warn that annexation could leave people like Mohammed Ayer in territorial enclaves. \nA study by the US think tank the Washington Institute suggests \"full annexation\" by Israel of up to 30% of the West Bank could affect almost 110,000 Palestinians.\nMr Netanyahu has said those in the Jordan Valley, for example, would remain \"Palestinian subjects\". Critics fear that means they would effectively live in islands of only Palestinian civil control, surrounded by land under full Israeli jurisdiction. \nThe Palestinian leadership, along with almost 50 experts appointed by the United Nations Human Rights Council, say this would formalise a system of \"apartheid\" in the West Bank - two peoples ruled by one state in the same space with unequal rights.\nSome Israeli opposition figures from Jewish majority parties view the plan as a nightmare, being carried out carelessly. They see little gain from unilateral annexation, while leaving Israel's global image tarnished.\nBut retired Israeli Brigadier-General Yossi Kuperwasser believes the numbers of Palestinians caught in any unilateral application of sovereignty would be \"negligible\".   \nHe says many could receive Israeli residency in the interim and suggests the Palestinian leadership should engage with the Trump administration. \n\"This was the logic of the US peace plan,\" he says. \"The Palestinians are going to be citizens of the future Palestinian state.\"  \nThe drive to the Palestinian city of Ramallah is often complicated. The city has a small number of entry and exit points, and big traffic jams are a constant feature. \nRamallah is home to the headquarters of the Palestinian Authority (PA).\nThe governing body was born as a result of the Oslo Accords of the 1990s - the high-water mark of Israeli-Palestinian peace-making.  \nNow, in a bid to increase international pressure to avert annexation, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas says the PA is no longer bound by agreements with Israel and the US, including on security.  \nSome fear suspending such co-ordination, if fully delivered, could precipitate a collapse of the PA and the potential for a slide into chaos in the West Bank.  \nAmid the bitter divisions of Palestinian politics, the militant group Hamas - the main rival of President Abbas' Fatah movement - could try to capitalise and is warning of a confrontation with Israel.\nI arrive for a news conference by the Palestinian Prime Minister, Mohammad Shtayyeh. Security is always tight. Now there's also an anti-coronavirus washdown before you enter the building - I step into a booth where I'm showered with sanitiser fluid, mostly soaking my hair.  \nThe pandemic is slowing entry to the building, but it has not paused the region's politics. \nMr Shtayyeh believes Israel's plans bring the conflict to a new junction in history. \n\"This peace process has reached a serious impasse,\" he says. \"We are facing a moment of truth for us as a Palestinian leadership.\" \nI ask about the prospects for the future of the PA. \n\"Let's not fool ourselves,\" he replies. \"The PA is not a gift from anybody. It came into being because of the Palestinian people... We are not going to throw away the key and go home.\" \nMr Shtayyeh accuses the international community of failing to act. \nWhy doesn't his leadership engage with the US and negotiate, he is asked. \nHe says annexation would amount to the \"destruction\" of a future Palestinian state, and suggests accepting it would leave the PA becoming \"a bunch of traitors - and we will not be\".\nWhat happens next? Mr Netanyahu continues to talk up his plans, despite speculation that they were a gimmick to rally the right wing in three deadlocked elections. \n\"These territories are where the Jewish nation was born and grew,\" the prime minister said of the settlements when his new coalition government was about to be sworn in in May. \n\"[Applying Israeli law to them] won't distance us from peace. It will bring us closer.\"\nThe coalition agreement allows him to bring proposals to the cabinet or the Israeli parliament from 1 July.   \nThe US administration, having signalled in May that it didn't expect the process to be rushed, may now be ready to back the proposals Mr Netanyahu arrives at broadly on the conditions that he commits to the Trump plan as a package (meaning keeping open the possibility of Palestinian negotiations in the next four years) and that there is consensus among the principle players in the coalition.  \nThis adds to the significance of the views of Benny Gantz, the defence minister and alternate prime minister due to take over from Mr Netanyahu late next year.  \nMr Gantz is thought to be less willing to back sweeping unilateral annexation plans and he wants co-ordination with Washington and Arab countries that have ties with Israel. \nThe latter - in particular neighbouring Jordan - have voiced vehement opposition to any form of annexation, raising concerns about regional stability if the move goes ahead. \nMr Gantz's Blue and White party, whose success in the elections was partly down to left-wing votes, is \"walking a tight-rope\" on the issue says Lahav Harkov, diplomatic correspondent at the Jerusalem Post. \nWhile Mr Netanyahu \"wants to push for all of it\", Mr Gantz and Foreign Minister Gabi Ashkenazi, his Blue and White party colleague, are a lot more reticent, she tells me.   \nMore meetings between these key players seem certain.  \nI make another return to Begin Highway, this time heading back into Jerusalem. The Israeli prime minister's office and the parliament are off a junction heading east. More history-making could lie on the road ahead.\n.",

        "title": "Putin defies pandemic with parade and vote",
        "description": "Moscow's coronavirus lockdown was strict and long. Its end has been swift and almost total.\nVeterans in their nineties joined President Vladimir Putin on Wednesday for a giant 75th anniversary Victory Day parade as if facemasks and social distancing were never invented.\nAnd across the city, with the sun finally beating down, crowds have been flooding back to parks, bars and restaurant terraces, shrugging off the weeks hiding indoors from infection as an unpleasant memory.\nOfficially Covid-19 has been declared \"in retreat\". But with more than 600,000 cases detected country-wide, some fear such statements are aimed at clearing the way for Vladimir Putin's political priorities: a parade, and a vote on extending his rule.\n\"The whole country had been preparing all year for the Victory Day parade,\" retired naval officer Alexander Goncharov says, after helping get World War Two veterans to the event postponed from 9 May by the pandemic. \nHe said 28 of them, who'd occupied the seats closest to President Putin, had spent more than two weeks at a sanatorium outside Moscow in pre-parade quarantine, with regular health checks and Covid tests. \nOn the day itself, all were covered in medals. Very few wore face coverings. \n\"They were sure they'd be OK. They shook hands with the president with no gloves or anything,\" Mr Goncharov told the BBC. \n\"If the leader of the country is not afraid, then I'm sure the veterans are confident too.\"\nThe statistics might indicate a more cautious approach.\nBack in April, when Mr Putin declared it too risky to press ahead with the 9 May events, Russia was detecting around 3,500 Covid cases each day. Currently the figure is twice that, although in Moscow the infection rate has been falling. \nShops, hairdressers - even the zoo - have re-opened in recent weeks. The latest restrictions were lifted on Tuesday, including on indoor cafes, playgrounds and gyms. \nA day later, thousands of troops marched across the cobblestones of Red Square to mark the Soviet defeat of Nazi Germany, a moment of history Vladimir Putin describes as 'sacred.'\nFor this big anniversary, President Putin had wanted world leaders alongside him on the tribune, underlining his assertion of modern Russia as a global power as its military arsenal was paraded before them. \nThe pandemic put paid to that. \nThe handful of heads of state who did make it to Moscow were mostly from former Soviet republics. Their ranks were depleted even further when two of the Kyrgyz delegation tested positive for Covid-19, forcing the president to skip the parade. \nThe public, though, defied instructions to watch from home on television: mass gatherings are still banned here.\nMany stood on bridges and pavements to watch tanks roll through the city centre. Ignoring the mandatory facemask rule, they squeezed together behind police barriers to snap photos. \nNo-one stepped in to break up the crowds. This event was always intended as a patriotic boost; a feel-good day after a tough couple of months and a reminder of what Vladimir Putin represents. \nIt was scheduled one day before the start of voting on a constitutional reform package that could see him running twice more for president.\nIn a recent interview, an infectious diseases specialist in Orel, south-west of Moscow, had a stark warning about that ballot. \n\"Let whoever wants to vote, vote. But there's no more hospital beds,\" Viktoria Adoneva told a local paper. \"There will definitely be a [surge in cases]; but we'll have nowhere to put them.\"\nWhen her words caused a national scandal she claimed they'd been distorted, but others agree.\n\"I think this vote will only help spread the virus,\" warns Dr Anton, an ER doctor in Moscow who doesn't want me to use his surname. \nHis own hospital is back operating as normal again after treating only Covid-19 cases at the height of the pandemic - a time he recalls as \"terrifying\". \n\"The image they're creating: the fall in patient numbers, the end of restrictions, the parade - it's all wonderful, like there's no problem. But there are problems,\" Anton says.\nVladimir Putin himself argues that the constitutional reform allowing him to run again is a vote for stability, eliminating unsettling speculation over who would succeed him come 2024. \nOthers see it as grabbing a \"window of political opportunity\" to ensure he stays in power, snatched between an apparent \"victory\" over the virus and before the economic effects of the pandemic are fully felt. \nIn Moscow, those who want to take part can vote online. \nThat's risky, according to election monitors, in terms of vote-rigging, but safer physically in a pandemic. For those who do turn out in person, voting has been spread over a week. \n\"The problem is everyone's stopped thinking about coronavirus; they think it's all over,\" Dr Anton worries.\nAfter all, their president - who spent a couple of months tucked away in his residence, holding video conference calls - is now walking around without a facemask and shaking hands. \n\"People are edging closer and closer together on public transport and all over the place,\" the doctor warns. \"The risk of a new outbreak is very high.\"",

        "title": "Dressing to impress: Nigeria-style",
        "description": "Nigerian photographer Oye Diran reimagines the fashion of the Yoruba people in a stunning series of images.\nWhen an aunt sent Oye Diran an old family photo, he was mesmerised by the high sense of fashion and style exhibited by the Yoruba women of West Africa in the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s.\nThe photo was of his mother and her sister adorned in iro and buba, the colourful two-piece outfit of wrapped skirt and top popular with Yoruba women in Nigeria.\nDiran, a Yoruba himself and Nigerian photographer based in New York, noticed how the style of the iro and buba had evolved over time, but that the outfit still maintained its elegance.\nInspired, he ploughed through the internet looking for more vintage images of the outfit but was disappointed with what he saw.\n\"What I found were updated and modernised versions that people wear today which wasn't what I needed,\" he told the BBC.\nHe then picked up his camera and produced a series of images which he titled A Ti De (We Have Arrived).\nThe Yoruba are Nigeria's second largest ethnic group with a reputation for loud celebrations and incessant parties - anything from a new child to a new house warrants a huge gathering of friends and family and music, food and drinks.\nThe centrepiece at gatherings, especially weddings, are the matching colourful outfits worn by guests.\nFor the women it is the iro and buba which in the past would sit at the bottom of the steel box awaiting its call for that special occasion. \nBut its glory days are long gone, replaced by the aso-ebi, when guests all wear outfits made from the same pattern. \nAs a sign of how times have changed, the aso-ebi doesn't sit at the bottom of a heavy steel box, but hides in the darkest corner of a wardrobe, away from the light and other not so important outfits, as it awaits the special day. \n\"Yoruba fashion has evolved in different ways over the last few decades but has always maintained its authentic look,\" Diran told the BBC.\n\"I feel we started seeing more of its modernisation from the 2000s up until today.\n\"For example, in the 1960s the length of the iro ended right above the knees. Today the length of the iro can go as far as the feet. We see influences from other fashion trends around the world on Yoruba fashion,\" he said.\nDiran, a fine art and fashion photographer, was born in Nigeria's commercial capital, Lagos, to a mother who was a visual artist and a father who was a veterinary doctor and businessman. \n\"My mother had an art studio in our childhood home where I would see old work she had done along with new pieces she was creating through mixed media, drawings, paintings and photography. \n\"I basically grew up surrounded and inspired by art.\"\nHe fused his background in art and his interest in photography to create his current style which he describes as \"conceptual with a degree of minimalism\".\nHe mostly creates with a palette of neutral and pastel colours.\n\"I try to illuminate a sense a beauty, empowerment and ideologies in my images,\" he said.\nThe Yoruba fashion has evolved to incorporate trends, from flared sleeves to puff sleeves to off-shoulder blouses and narrower collars.  \nMaterials that weren't traditionally used, from chiffon to organza are now being worn and most importantly, the outfits that were traditionally loose are now more fitted. \n\"A Ti De is a phrase of confidence,\" he said.\n\"It is used to announce one's arrival in a celebratory fashion in most cases.\"\nFor the party-loving Yoruba people, truer words have never been spoken.\nAll images subject to copyright",

        "title": "I’m running for office because of George Floyd",
        "description": "The death of George Floyd at the hands of Minneapolis police officers has sparked a movement to close racial divides worldwide. \nBut for Zina Fizer, who lives and works in the city where Mr Floyd was killed, the flashpoint for what is now a global movement is acutely personal. Watching Mr Floyd's death, \"I saw my 24-year-old black son under that man's knee and my heart broke,\" Ms Fizer said. \"I knew I had to do something.\"\nNow, Ms Fizer is joined by a wave of African-American women motivated by the death of Mr Floyd to seek public office this year. If she is successful in her bid for state Senate, she will be Minnesota's first black female state senator. \nOne month after George Floyd's death, Ms Fizer and three other candidates tell the BBC why they're running, and how they see black women leading this next chapter in American history. \nI've been politically active for years, starting in electoral politics straight out of college. I've been asked several times to run for public office myself and in a moment of prayer, I told my God that the next time I was asked, I would say yes. \nI knew I had to come forward when I saw the video of the murder of George Floyd and the knee pressing on his neck as he uttered in his last breaths a call to his mother. During those eight minutes and forty six seconds, I knew that I had to come forward. \nI think that this is a moment that has been building over time. The moment that we are all in, I think we have seen it before. But this time it was the callousness that was undeniable. And for whatever reasons that this society has made excuses for its behaviour in the past, it could no longer stand on those excuses. \nTogether, people of goodwill and of good conscience came out in protest in various ways. I came to make a difference in the laws that govern these moments. The structure that was built on systemic racism in this country was built intentionally. And it has to be dismantled intentionally. It has to be rebuilt, taking into account the needs of the people it actually serves. \nMy major policy aims would be to craft a constitutional amendment that redefines policing in the state of Minnesota. The focus has been on protecting private property over public safety. And secondly, to take full advantage of the exposure Covid-19 has made on the fact that we don't have healthcare coverage for everyone. This pandemic, I think, lifts that issue to the forefront.\nI bring a vision that includes all of us. And I'm hopeful that I'm not alone in that. The vision I can't get out of my mind is with Gianna Floyd, with her arms outstretched saying 'my Daddy changed the world'. And I want to say to her 'yes he did', because he changed me. \nThe moment I decided to run was when George Floyd called out to his mom. I saw my 24-year-old black son under that man's knee and my heart broke. And at that moment I knew I had to do something. Something in me broke. No longer can we just sit here and wait for other people to make changes in our community.\nMinnesota has never had a black woman that's been in the Senate. We have four different black women running for Senate. It would be monumental if all four of us were elected to our seats. I think that that's what Minnesota needs to do, just to begin the healing process in our communities. Minnesota is the template. I think the rest of the country will follow suit. \nWe're in this perfect storm, we're in the middle of a pandemic. We have protests worldwide, civil unrest and it's wind underneath my wings right now. \nWhy is it such an important time for black women? Because we have supported you. We have encouraged you. So it's like we can be a support, but never the lead. And we haven't gotten any results. It's important for us to take the lead at this point because we actually know what we're doing. We literally and figuratively have birthed the nation. So I think it's time. People are tired and we're tired of the status quo. America needs to be ready. \nI decided to run for office because of the unfortunate circumstances surrounding George's Floyd's murder for all of eight minutes and forty six seconds. I wanted to know that his call to his mother did not go unanswered. \nI was asked to consider running for the state Senate and I initially thought 'that's pretty far-fetched' but when I realized that as George was calling for his mother, that I had a responsibility to answer that call.  I decided that it was time for me to step up. As a black woman living in America I realized that my voice needed to be heard. Policy and change can only happen when you're at the table. \nI feel so empowered to be among 10 to 20 black women who are taking a stand to be a part of the election process. The status quo can no longer continue. We've just got to change things. I feel this is a key moment in time. Black women are rising. And I mean, in order to really get things done in this country, I think women are the ones who can get it done. And black women in particular because we've been asked to wait our turn. We've been asked to sit this one out. \nYou know what's stuck in my mind through all of this? The fact that so many people have come together from all races, all walks of life. And the young people who are are rising up and standing in solidarity with Black Lives Matter and with all of the injustices that have just gone on for far too long. And it feels good because we now know that people see us, you know our struggle, you know our challenges and our heartbreaks. \nI really believe what has happened here in Minnesota will be a model for the world to see. I really believe Minnesota will work hard to make this right. All eyes are on us. \nWe have more black women running this year than usual. We put out a call as Black Women Rising to African-American women to say our time is now. We have worked with women for years who've been interested in running for office, had planned on running for office, but probably wouldn't have done it this year, myself included. \nBut with the pandemic revealing the disparities in healthcare and then we have George Floyd who was killed in our state and, for many of us, in our city. And when George cried out for his mother, I don't think there's a mother anywhere who didn't feel something, but particularly as a black mother. That was the thing that pushed us to this next level. The time is now, we can't wait. \nWe bring a different perspective to politics as black women. We have the ability and the tendency to look out for everyone. We're connected with people who are closest to the pain in ways that other politicians probably are not. \nI feel like we have lived a lifetime in this last month. But the one thing that gives me hope is that when I look out at the protesters, I see a multi-ethnic and multi-generational group of people. And particularly to see the young people show up and protest, that gave me hope because I feel like this current generation will have a different set of expectations for what America should look like.\nI don't know if America is ready for the rise of black women but they have to get ready. We can't wait for people to get ready. We know our time is now. ",

        "title": "Can India afford to boycott Chinese products?",
        "description": "Anti-China sentiment has been on the rise in India since last week’s fatal border clash between the two nuclear-armed neighbours.  \nTwenty Indian soldiers were killed in fighting at a disputed border site in the Himalayan Galwan Valley, prompting a swift and theatrical backlash on India’s streets. \nPeople in the western Indian city of Ahmedabad hurled Chinese TV sets down their balconies, while traders in the capital, Delhi, protested by burning Chinese goods. \nA central minister called for a boycott of restaurants selling “Chinese food” - an Indianised version of Chinese cuisine that is hugely popular; an opposition leader was seen clambering atop a JCB machine to blacken a billboard of Chinese smartphone maker Oppo; a group of eager protesters went viral after burning an effigy of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, mistaking him for Chinese President, Xi Jinping. \nThe Indian government hasn’t explicitly announced a boycott, but by all accounts states and public sector companies have been reportedly asked to desist from issuing new contracts to Chinese companies. The railways have reportedly cancelled a signalling project that was given to a Chinese company in 2016. And, according to reports, the government has also asked e-commerce companies to display the country of origin for the products they sell.\nBilateral trade between the countries, already down by 15% since the 2018 financial year, could take a further hit as India mulls extra tariffs and anti-dumping duties on Chinese imports. \nBut, experts warn, it’s easier said than done to convert such boycott rhetoric into reality. \nWhat is the alternative to China?\nFor one, China is India’s second-largest trading partner after the US. And two, it accounts for nearly 12% of India’s imports across sectors such as chemicals, automotive components, consumer electronics and pharmaceuticals. \n“At least 70% of India’s drug intermediary needs are fulfilled by China,” Sudarshan Jain, president of the Indian Pharmaceutical Alliance, told the BBC. \nAlthough India has announced a new policy to become more self-reliant in drugs, he says that will take time. \nIndia’s booming smartphone sector also heavily depends on cheap Chinese phones made by Oppo, Xaomi and others with the lion’s share of the local market. \nMost consumer electronics makers say they’ll be paralysed if they can’t import crucial intermediate goods from China. \n“We are not worried about finished goods. But most players across the globe import key components such as compressors from China,” says B Thiagrajan, managing director of Blue Star Limited, an Indian manufacturer of air conditioners, air purifiers and water coolers.\nMr Thiagrajan adds that it will take a long time to set up local supply chains, and that there are few alternatives for certain kinds of imports. \nChinese money funds Indian unicorns\nIndia and China have also become increasingly integrated in recent years. Chinese money, for instance, has penetrated India's technology sector, with companies like Alibaba and Tencent strategically pumping in billions of dollars into Indian startups such as Zomato, Paytm, Big Basket and Ola. This has led to Chinese giants deeply \"embedding themselves\" in India’s socio-economic and technology ecosystem, according to Gateway House, a Mumbai-based think tank. \n“There have been more than 90 Chinese investments in Indian startups, most of them made over the last five years. Eighteen out of 30 Indian unicorns [tech startups valued at over $1bn] have a Chinese investor,” says Amit Bhandari, an analyst at Gateway house.\nAt $6.2bn, direct Chinese investment in India appears relatively small. But, Mr Bhandari says, restricting the likes of Alibaba from creating monopolies in the Indian market will be crucial given the “outsized impact” of these investments.\nTo that effect, India has already amended its FDI (foreign direct investment) rules to stave off hostile takeovers of Indian companies. \nWhile China has accused India of contravening WTO principles, it’s unlikely to cut ice under current circumstances \"as there is no way of enforcing any decision if an inter-country conflict is cited as a reason to justify the violations”, Zulfiquar Memon, managing partner at MZM Legal, said in an email interview.\nThis gives India some leeway to reduce its dependence on imports, and heed growing calls for self-reliance. India’s gaping trade deficit of nearly $50bn with China has long been a sticking point between the two countries, and the current standoff provides an impetus for India to shrink the gap.  \nIs self-reliance the answer?\nIndia’s domestic manufacturing sector can substitute as much as 25% of total imports from China, according to new findings from Acuité, a ratings agency.  This would lead to a reduced import bill of over $8bn in a single year.\nHandicrafts, for instance, is a category where India imported $431m worth of goods from China in the 2020 financial year without any significant reciprocal exports. \nBut Mr Bhandari of Gateway House says boycotting popular Chinese apps such as TikTok might be more effective than boycotting physical goods in terms of value added because there are multiple alternatives. \nBut from India’s standpoint, none of this is likely to play out without grave consequences to the economy, especially during a severe downturn. China, on the other hand, is less concerned since India accounts for only 3% of its exports.\nSo far Beijing has been restrained in its reaction to the growing backlash in India. \nBut a recent op-ed in the daily Global Times warned that “China's restraint is not weak”.\nIt says it would “be extremely dangerous for India to allow anti-China groups to stir public opinion, thus escalating tensions”, and adds that the focus should instead be on “economic recovery”.",

The dock, where defendants normally sit, was used as extra space for media. \nThe boy's family said Bravery's crime against their son was \"unspeakable\".\nIn a statement taken six months after the attack, his parents said they had maintained a near-constant bedside vigil at the Royal London Hospital.\nThis continued, they said, after he was transferred to a French hospital in September, with the family only returning home on rare occasions to collect belongings.\n\"We were forced to sleep in very rough conditions in the 'family room' of one of the hospitals, on a mattress on the floor, in a draught, before finding an AirBnB nearby offering better sleeping conditions and a place where to finally put down our things,\" they said.\n\"In all, we've stayed in eight different accommodations so far and are about to move once more.\n\"We have been so scared of losing him that now it is impossible for us to spend more than a few hours away from him,\" they said.\nThey said their son was unable to trust people, and said he \"would like to slap\" Bravery for what he did.\n\"Our son lives in fear of meeting other villains in his life,\" they said.\nDr Joanna Dow, a consultant forensic psychiatrist who works at Broadmoor Hospital where Bravery is being held, said she believed the Bravery had a mixed personality disorder and struggled to manage his emotions.\nShe recommended he be detained in hospital, rather than handed a prison sentence, so he could get treatment for anger management and help to learn social communication and interaction skills.\nBravery's defence barrister Pippa McAtasney QC said at the time of the attack the teenager had been in the care of Hammersmith and Fulham Council.\nShe referenced a recording obtained by the BBC which revealed Bravery told carers about his plans to kill a year earlier.\nMs McAtasney said letters from his parents revealed to the court that Bravery was diagnosed with autism and \"is a loved child\".\n\"Both parents strived to improve the quality of his life and secured and managed environment for their son,\" she said.\n\"They had no inclination their son would commit such a shocking crime. Those responsible for his care never communicated the contents of the shocking, prophetic recording that was revealed through the media.\"\nThe hearing continues.\nFor more London news follow on Facebook, on Twitter, on Instagram and subscribe to our YouTube channel.",

        "title": "Heads angry as government downplays school 2m rule",
        "description": "Head teachers' leaders have reacted angrily to a government attempt to downplay the need for social distancing in schools, ahead of full reopening.\nA Department for Education blog says primary pupils in England do not need to keep 2m apart, and that: \"this has been the case throughout\". \nThe National Association of Head Teachers called the blog post \"disingenuous\". \nBut a DfE spokesman said the department was \"absolutely standing by it\". \nThe blog says: \"Primary pupils do not and have not needed to be kept apart in the classroom and we are encouraging primary heads to use the capacity they have, and the flexibility we have given them, to bring more groups of children back into school if they can work within the protective measures.\"\nBut when primary schools reopened to more pupils from Reception and Years 1 and Year 6 at the beginning of June, most heads believed they were expected, if possible, to keep children 2m apart from each other, even within small \"bubbles\" of up to 15 children. \nThey went to great efforts to reorganise classrooms and timetables and to rewrite school policies. \nAny full reopening of schools planned for September is likely to involve a relaxation of the 2m rule. \nBut the blog suggests the 2m rule was never set in stone for primary age children, and has drawn ire from head teachers' leaders. \n\"It's a bit rich that the government is now downplaying social distancing when it is mentioned on a number of occasions in their own guidance,\" said Geoff Barton, General Secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders. \n\"In summary, that guidance recognises that early years and primary school children cannot be expected to remain 2m apart, but if settings can do so, they should do so, and that secondary schools and colleges should do so where possible.\"\nPaul Whiteman, General Secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers said the union and many of its members were \"unimpressed\".\n\"Given the lack of clarity and the conflicting messages contained within the protective measures guidance, it is disingenuous to suggest that the position has ever been as definitive as is now being claimed,\" he said. \nA Department for Education spokesman said there was no contradiction in the blog, and claimed that much of the adverse reaction had come from heads who had misinterpreted the guidance and \"put in measures they never needed to put in\". \n\"Our guidance has always acknowledge that early years and primary age children cannot be expected to remain 2m  apart from each other and staff.\n\"Instead schools were asked to implement a hierarchy of controls to reduce the risk of transmission.\n\"If schools could keep children 2m apart, they were asked to do so, but this was not required if the wider range of measures were in place.\" ",

        "title": "NI to move to 1m distancing rule from Monday",
        "description": "The Stormont Executive has agreed to reduce social distancing in Northern Ireland from 2m (6ft) to 1m with restrictions from Monday, Arlene Foster has confirmed.\nIt comes days after the prime minister said England would move to \"1m plus\" on 4 July, as its lockdown is eased.\nThe proposal was brought to the executive by Economy Minister Diane Dodds.\nThe first minister said hospitality businesses must uphold safety.\nMrs Foster and Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill also announced a series of other indicative dates for easing the lockdown further in Northern Ireland.\nThey include:\nIn relation to the 1m move, members of the hospitality industry had argued it was necessary to help them restart their businesses. \nHotels, pubs, restaurants and cafes are due to reopen in Northern Ireland on 3 July.\n\"The reason why we believe we can move to 1m is in relation to having other mitigations in place to manage that risk,\" the first minister told the daily executive press conference.\n\"Nothing is risk-free and it is important the hospitality and tourism sectors work with us.\"\nMs O'Neill said caution was \"imperative\".\n\"We may need to amend these dates and the executive is prepared to step back if the need arises,\" she added.\nThey said they were advising people to wear face coverings, but they understood it may not be practical if people are going out for a meal.\nElite athletes have also been told they can begin to train indoors again from 29 June.\nAthletes classed as elite include Olympians, Paralympians, professional rugby, GAA and football players and cricketers.\nUntil now, they have only been allowed to train outdoors, with some swimmers travelling to Dublin for indoor pool use.\nContact sports training on a wider basis is also allowed to resume from Monday.\nThe first and deputy first ministers also confirmed that places of worship can reopen, as planned, on a wider basis from Monday as well.\nThey said \"great engagement\" had taken place with church and faith leaders about how services could be conducted.\n\"What we want to do over the course of the next day or so is work out numbers in relation to weddings and funerals,\" said Ms O'Neill.\nShe added that the executive would discuss that in more detail next week.\nMrs Foster said ministers had not reached an agreement about whether face coverings should become mandatory on public transport - but it will be looked at again on Monday.\nThe first minister also revealed that the executive have been able to sign off funding for free school meals over the summer.\nEarlier this week it was held up after a row between Sinn Féin and the DUP over the failure to implement a payment scheme for victims of the Troubles.\nMrs Foster said Finance Minister Conor Murphy would detail the funding allocations from the June monitoring round in the assembly on Tuesday, which would include the estimated £12m to continue free school meals payments in July and August.\nOn Thursday, no further deaths were added to the Department of Health's total of 547, which mostly consists of deaths in hospitals.\nA further two positive cases of Covid-19 in Northern Ireland were recorded.\nThe Department of Health has also said that Northern Ireland's R-number - or reproduction number - \"remains steady\" between 0.6 and 0.9.\nIt is the average number of people that one coronavirus-infected person will pass the virus on to.\nMrs Foster also said the total number of infectious people in Northern Ireland is currently estimated to be fewer than 600.\nThe World Health Organization recommends keeping a distance of at least 1m.\nSome countries have adopted this guidance, often because they also insist on people wearing masks.\nBut it is not just about distance, but also timing.\nThe longer you spend in close proximity with an infected person, the bigger the risk.\nScientists advising the UK government say spending six seconds at a distance of 1m from someone is the same as spending one minute at a distance of 2m.\nFollowing the executive's 1m announcement on Thursday, the chair of the British Medical Association (BMA) in Northern Ireland, Dr Tom Black, said the change is \"acceptable only if accompanied by a clear and strong recommendation from our government that people should wear appropriate face coverings in all indoor spaces outside of their own homes and in any circumstances outside of the home where there is potential contact at less than 2m\".\n\"We also want to see how the Northern Ireland government will measure the impact of this latest relaxation and to show there are clear and robust measures to ensure these changes do not result in more people becoming infected, ill, or die, or contribute to a second spike which could overwhelm the health service should that occur this winter.\"",

        "description": "Driving lessons are to resume in England from 4 July, House of Commons leader Jacob Rees-Mogg has announced.\nThe Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency will write to driving instructors later setting out plans to restart driving tests and resume lessons safely.\nMr Rees-Mogg said he wanted to help instructors \"return to life that is as close to normal as possible, as quickly and fairly as possible\".\nThere will be a \"phased approach to resuming practical testing\", he added.\nScotland, Wales and Northern Ireland will set their own rules for the return of driving lessons and tests.\nWhen asked what advice will be given to instructors on resuming work safely, the DVSA told the BBC that \"more details will be provided in due course\".\nSpeaking at Business Questions in the Commons, Mr Rees-Mogg said: \"From the 4 July I am happy to say that people will be able to take driving lessons on a motorcycle, or in a car, lorry or bus and there will be a phased approach to resuming practical testing so learners have the opportunity to practice before taking a test.\" \nHe added the industry should return \"in a way that avoids a second peak in infections\".\nAA Driving School, which also runs the British School of Motoring, said it was advising instructors that they should \"thoroughly\" clean vehicles before and after each lesson, \"paying particular attention to areas of the car that are touch points, such as door handles.\" Other measures for instructors include:\nPupils will also be asked to wash their hands before each lesson and wear a face covering. \nThe AA said it considered the use of plastic screens, like in taxis, but said it was \"imperative\" that instructors could reach the steering wheel in an emergency, which was not possible with a screen.\nSarah Rees, managing director of AA Driving School, said the decision was a \"welcome relief for the thousands of people in England\" wanting to learn to drive, and the beginning of the end of \"an incredibly challenging time\" for instructors.\nShe added, however, that instructors in other parts of the UK - where a return date was yet to be set - were \"being left in limbo\".\nGraham Quail, 52, owner of Quail's School of Motoring in Wirral, said the move was \"fantastic news\" and \"long overdue\", adding that the lockdown period had been \"hard\" for staff. \nThe driving school, which employs 17 instructors providing lessons in Wirral and the surrounding areas including North Wales and Liverpool, was effectively forced to close during lockdown - bar teaching a few key worker students who needed to take a test for their jobs.\nMr Quail said the school has had systems to curb the spread of coronavirus in place \"since before lockdown\" - such as cleaning vehicles before and after lessons, and providing face masks and gloves for instructors and students.\nBut it is now \"eagerly awaiting\" official guidance from the DVLA for resuming lessons.\n\"We're looking forward to restarting,\" said Mr Quail. \"We're going to make sure that all our students are kept safe and hopefully get people driving again.\"\nHe added that resuming lessons would also help those looking for work amid the coronavirus crisis. \"A lot of our students come to us because it's necessary for a job so I hope it will help kickstart this for them,\" he said.\nDriving lessons and tests have been suspended since March. However, there have been exceptions, with some key workers being offered both lessons and the opportunity to apply to the DVSA for an emergency test. ",

        "description": "More than 100,000 people in England have been asked to self-isolate by contact tracers in the past three weeks to contain coronavirus, data shows.\nThe individuals have all had close contact with infected people and have now been told to stay at home by the new NHS Test and Trace service.\nBut the service, which launched at the end of May, continues to struggle to engage people who have tested positive.\nA quarter of those who tested positive could not be reached by tracers.\nMeanwhile, data on infection rates suggest the amount of virus is not rising despite the relaxation of restrictions over the past six weeks.\nAnd another 149 deaths following a positive diagnosis of coronavirus have been reported in the past 24 hours, bringing the total number of fatalities to more than 43,200.\nThere are three key sources that provide evidence about infection rates - and overall it looks like they are falling.\nThe government has just released the latest estimate for the R number - the rate at which infections are spreading. \nIt is between 0.7 and 0.9. A figure of below one means the number of new infections are going down.\nThe seven-day average for the number of daily confirmed cases currently stands at under 900, down from nearly 4,000 in the week the prime minister announced the first steps out of lockdown.\nHowever, the Office for National Statistics surveillance programme suggests falling rates may have levelled off.\nThe findings released on Thursday found 14 out of 24,500 people tested in the community in England were infected.\nThis equates to 0.09% of the population being currently infected - or one in 1,100 people.\nIt is a small rise from the week before, but not enough to be considered statistically significant.\nThe NHS Test and Trace service has tried to trace the contacts of more than 20,000 people who have tested positive for Covid-19 since it was launched at the end of May.\nSome 15,000 have provided details, giving the tracing service nearly 130,000 contacts.\nClose to 114,000 of them - about nine in 10 - have been reached by the service over its first three weeks and asked to self-isolate at home.\nIn the most recent week performance in terms of numbers not engaging and numbers of contacts reached both dropped a little.\nBaroness Dido Harding, the head of the service, said variability form week to week was to be expected.\nShe said she was happy with the performance so far, saying it would improve in the coming weeks and months and would play a vital role in \"curbing\" the spread of the virus.\nThe service has once again not been able to provide details for how quickly people are being contacted following a positive result.\nGovernment advisers believe contacts need to be found within 48 hours for the service to be most effective.\nScotland, Northern Ireland and Wales run their own tracing services.\nProf Keith Neal, an expert in infectious diseases from the University of Nottingham, said the biggest issue lay with the attitude of the public.\nHe said the numbers coming forward for testing was thought to be lower than the actual number who are infected, while the fact that one in four people who test positive do not engage with the system was \"worryng.\"\n\"These can only be sorted by members of the public as they require individuals to take the appropriate actions to reduce spread.\" \nIt comes as the NHS Test and Trace programme has started trialling walk-in testing centres. The pilots are being held in London, Newcastle, Rochdale and Slough.\nThey involve buildings as well as open-air locations, including a basketball court.\nCurrently, testing is available at hospitals, mobile testing units, regional drive-through centres, and via a postal service.\nFollow Nick on Twitter\nRead more from Nick",

        "title": "Covid-19 antibody test lacks 'proper assessment'",
        "description": "Covid-19 antibody tests for NHS and care staff are being rolled out without \"adequate assessment\", experts warn.\nThe tests could place an unnecessary burden on the NHS, the 14 senior academics say in a letter in the BMJ.  \nLast month, the government said it had bought 10 million antibody tests and asked NHS trusts and care homes to make them available to staff in England.  \nOfficials say the blood tests - to see if someone has had the virus - will play an \"increasingly important role\".\nSome patients and people having routine blood tests in England are being offered them too. \nThey normally show if someone -  who has previously been unwell with a bug -  has developed antibodies that offer protection against future bouts of the illness.\nBut how the immune system reacts to the Covid-19 virus remains uncertain.\nWith the current laboratory tests, NHS England says, a positive result shows a person has had coronavirus.\nBut crucially, it does not prove they have immunity against future attacks or whether they could transmit the virus to others. \n Smitha Mundasad, Health reporter\nThe debate around antibody testing seems to centre on the potential benefits for an individual - versus the benefit to public health.\nWhat is clear is that when individuals get positive results they cannot let their guard down or change their behaviour.\nBut antibody tests may help show how widespread the infection is, and give clues about who is most likely to get the virus and where.\nSome experts argue the best way to get this information is for the vast majority of antibody testing to take place in well-designed studies - rather than being offered to any health and care staff who want them.\nAnd a detailed review of evidence by the Cochrane group, suggests the timing of antibody tests is key - because if someone gets a test too early it may not work. The group suggests waiting at least two weeks after first getting symptoms.\nThe team also concluded a lot of the studies published so far on antibody tests are too small. They are calling for better, larger, trials - particularly in people who have no or mild symptoms - to see how accurate the tests are in these groups.\nNevertheless, health officials say gathering the results of these tests will help them understand more about the spread of disease.\nPublic Health England has launched a study of 10,000 healthcare workers which involves antibody and other blood tests to learn more about immunity to the virus. \nThe group of scientists say as a positive result is unable to prove immunity, the tests offer \"no benefit\" to hospitals and care staff.\nThe results do not change what personal protective equipment staff must wear, for example. \nThe academics also suggest there is little data on how well the test works for people at highest risk - including people belonging to some ethnic minorities and older patients. \nInstead, they call for other carefully designed strategies to help monitor the spread of the virus. \nProf Sir John Bell from Oxford University, who has advised the government on antibody tests, said the academics who wrote to the BMJ had underestimated the value of the tests.\n\"We do need to know how many people out there have been infected and the only way to do this is antibody testing,\" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.\nBut he said they were right to say there was not enough evidence that a positive test indicated immunity. \"You couldn't safely use it as a way of telling people whether they could be exposed or not,\" he said.\nProf Martin Hibberd, of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, described the tests as an important component of the public-health response. \nHe added: \"If used successfully, the data generated will be important surveillance information for understanding the effectiveness of control measures put in place.\"\nMeanwhile Dr Tom Wingfield, at the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine, said he shared the concerns raised in the academics' letter. \nHe added: \"We don't yet have sufficient evidence on accuracy and interpretation of antibody tests.\"\nA Public Health England official said all tests in the programme had been \"extensively validated by the manufacturers and have received CE marks\" indicating compliance with EU safety standards. \nWales is currently working on its testing policies. \nMeanwhile, Scotland's chief medical officer has written to all health boards to say they should not offer \"on-demand\" antibody testing to NHS staff, care workers or patients.\nHow have you been affected by coronavirus?

        "title": "Who's exempt from the quarantine rules?",
        "description": "A two-week quarantine period for anyone arriving in the UK is now being enforced.\nHome Secretary Priti Patel said the move is to protect public health, because imported coronavirus cases ''pose a more significant threat''. \nPassengers arriving in the UK by plane, ferry or train - including UK nationals - will be asked to provide an address where they will self-isolate for 14 days. Travellers can be fined £100 for failing to fill in a form with these details. \nSurprise visits will be used to check they are following the rules. Those in England could be fined up to £1,000 if they fail to self-isolate.\nPassengers should drive their own car to their destination, where possible. If they don't provide an address, the government will arrange accommodation at the traveller's expense.\nOnce at their destination they must not use public transport or taxis. They must not go to work, school, or public areas, or have visitors except for essential support. \nThey are also not allowed to go out to buy food, or other essentials, where they can rely on others. \nPeople returning from overseas will not be automatically eligible for statutory sick pay unless they meet the required conditions - for example displaying coronavirus symptoms.\nCurrently, anyone arriving from the Common Travel Area (CTA) - the Republic of Ireland, the Channel Islands, or the Isle of Man - will not have to enter quarantine, as long as they have been in the CTA for at least 14 days.\nAnd the government wants to relax the rules in early July for some other countries, with a series of \"travel corridors\" or \"air bridges\".\nCountries including France, Italy, Spain, Greece, Belgium, Germany, Norway, the Netherlands, Turkey and Finland are likely to be included.\nThis would mean that people travelling in either direction between the UK and these countries - where the rate of infection is currently low - would not have to self-isolate after they travel.\nIn the meantime, the government is currently advising against all non-essential travel abroad, and hasn't given a date for when quarantine will end.\nThe measures are due to be reviewed on 29 June, three weeks after their introduction, to check they remain ''effective and necessary''.\nThere are a number of groups who are exempt, including:\nTravellers could find they also have to enter quarantine when they arrive in another country. Some have introduced screening measures such as temperature checks, and entry restrictions. \nQuarantine has not been welcomed by the UK's travel industry. \nAirlines UK, which represents various airlines, said quarantine \"would effectively kill off air travel\".\nBritish Airways, EasyJet and Ryanair have launched a legal challenge against the policy. \nThe British Ports Association, which represents ferry companies, has also spoken out against the measures - calling them \"overzealous\".\nEasyJet has restarted a limited number of flights to European destinations, with all passengers and cabin crew told to wear face masks.\nRyanair plans to reintroduce 40% of its flights from 1 July, subject to travel restrictions being lifted and safety measures being brought in at airports.\nBritish Airways is reviewing its plans to run 50% of its schedule from July, because of the quarantine rules.\nAntibodies test\nA medical test that can show if a person has had the coronavirus and now has some immunity. The test detects antibodies in the blood, which are produced by the body to fight off the disease.\nAsymptomatic\nSomeone who has a disease but does not have any of the symptoms it causes. Some studies suggest some people with coronavirus carry the disease but don't show the common symptoms, such as a persistent cough or high temperature.\nContainment phase\nThe first part of the UK's strategy to deal with the coronavirus, which involved trying to identify infected people early and trace anyone who had been in close contact with them.\nCoronavirus\nOne of a group of viruses that can cause severe or mild illness in humans and animals. The coronavirus currently sweeping the world causes the disease Covid-19. The common cold and influenza (flu) are other types of coronaviruses.\nCovid-19\nThe disease caused by the coronavirus first detected in Wuhan, China, in late 2019. It primarily affects the lungs.\nDelay phase\nThe second part of the UK's strategy to deal with the coronavirus, in which measures such as social distancing are used to delay its spread.\nFixed penalty notice\nA fine designed to deal with an offence on the spot, instead of in court. These are often for driving offences, but now also cover anti-social behaviour and breaches of the coronavirus lockdown.\nFlatten the curve\nHealth experts use a line on a chart to show numbers of new coronavirus cases. If a lot of people get the virus in a short period of time, the line might rise sharply and look a bit like a mountain. However, taking measures to reduce infections can spread cases out over a longer period and means the \"curve\" is flatter. This makes it easier for health systems to cope.\nFlu\nShort for influenza, a virus that routinely causes disease in humans and animals, in seasonal epidemics.\nFurlough\nSupports firms hit by coronavirus by temporarily helping pay the wages of some staff. It allows employees to remain on the payroll, even though they aren't working.\nHerd immunity\nHow the spread of a disease slows after a sufficiently large proportion of a population has been exposed to it.\nImmune\nA person whose body can withstand or fend off a disease is said to be immune to it. Once a person has recovered from the disease caused by the coronavirus, Covid-19, for example, it is thought they cannot catch it again for a certain period of time.\nIncubation period\nThe period of time between catching a disease and starting to display symptoms.\nIntensive care\nHospital wards which treat patients who are very ill. They are run by specially-trained healthcare staff and contain specialist equipment.\nLockdown\nRestrictions on movement or daily life, where public buildings are closed and people told to stay at home. Lockdowns have been imposed in several countries as part of drastic efforts to control the spread of the coronavirus.\nMitigation phase\nThe third part of the UK's strategy to deal with the coronavirus, which will involve attempts to lessen the impact of a high number of cases on public services. This could mean the NHS halting all non-critical care and police responding to major crimes and emergencies only.\nNHS 111\nThe NHS's 24-hour phone and online service, which offers medical advice to anyone who needs it. People in England and Wales are advised to ring the service if they are worried about their symptoms. In Scotland, they should check NHS inform, then ring their GP in office hours or 111 out of hours. In Northern Ireland, they should call their GP.\nOutbreak\nMultiple cases of a disease occurring rapidly, in a cluster or different locations.\nPandemic\nAn epidemic of serious disease spreading rapidly in many countries simultaneously.\nPhase 2\nThis is when the UK will start to lift some of its lockdown rules while still trying to reduce the spread of coronavirus.\nPPE\nPPE, or personal protective equipment, is clothing and kit such as masks, aprons, gloves and goggles used by medical staff, care workers and others to protect themselves against infection from coronavirus patients and other people who might be carrying the disease.\nQuarantine\nThe isolation of people exposed to a contagious disease to prevent its spread.\nR0\nR0, pronounced \"R-naught\", is the average number of people who will catch the disease from a single infected person. If the R0 of coronavirus in a particular population is 2, then on average each case will create two more new cases. The value therefore gives an indication of how much the infection could spread.\nRecession\nThis happens when there is a significant drop in income, jobs and sales in a country for two consecutive three-month periods.\nSars\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome, a type of coronavirus that emerged in Asia in 2003.\nSelf-isolation\nStaying inside and avoiding all contact with other people, with the aim of preventing the spread of a disease.\nSocial distancing\nKeeping away from other people, with the aim of slowing down transmission of a disease. The government advises not seeing friends or relatives other than those you live with, working from home where possible and avoiding public transport.\nState of emergency\nMeasures taken by a government to restrict daily life while it deals with a crisis. This can involve closing schools and workplaces, restricting the movement of people and even deploying the armed forces to support the regular emergency services.\nStatutory instrument\nThese can be used by government ministers to implement new laws or regulations, or change existing laws. They are an easier alternative to passing a full Act of Parliament.\nSymptoms\nAny sign of disease, triggered by the body's immune system as it attempts to fight off the infection. The main symptoms of the coronavirus are a fever, dry cough and shortness of breath.\nVaccine\nA treatment that causes the body to produce antibodies, which fight off a disease, and gives immunity against further infection.\nVentilator\nA machine that takes over breathing for the body when disease has caused the lungs to fail.\nVirus\nA tiny agent that copies itself inside the living cells of any organism. Viruses can cause these cells to die and interrupt the body's normal chemical processes, causing disease.",

        "title": "Does the UK have coronavirus under control?",
        "description": "Society is reopening. The long national hibernation - to quote Prime Minister Boris Johnson - is coming to an end with the biggest lifting of restrictions so far due to take place in England at the start of July. \nLockdowns are also being eased in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, albeit at slightly different paces.\nIt is a massive moment - and one certainly not without risk. There have been warnings it could lead to a second peak in infections. \nSo how tight a grip does the UK have on coronavirus?\nRestrictions have to be lifted at some point. The big question is whether the UK is moving too soon.\nThe number of infections has fallen dramatically. \nThere are now just over 1,000 new cases a day on average. \nThat compares with an estimated 100,000 at the peak at the end of March - we don't know the exact figure because there was only limited testing in place.\nHuge progress has, therefore, been made. But the number of infections is still significantly higher than in other countries. \nThis certainly leaves the UK at higher risk of a second peak - and it is why there are plenty of experts, including former government chief scientific adviser Sir David King, voicing concern that restrictions are being eased too quickly. \nThere are two factors that determine how quickly it will spread - the steps we take to reduce the risk of transmission and the ability of the test and trace system to contain local flare-ups.\nWhile restrictions are easing, there are still many measures being taken to disrupt the spread of the virus.\nMost are focused on continued social distancing and creating barriers between people whether that is via wearing face-coverings on public transport, stopping face-to-face seating in workplaces and introducing screens in shops.\nAn unknown factor in reducing the risk of transmission is how quickly the public will embrace the new freedoms.\nProf Lucy Yardley, an expert in public health psychology at the University of Bristol, believes people will be \"naturally cautious\", particularly those at higher risk.\nWhere local outbreaks happen - and they certainly will - the ability of the test and trace systems to get a handle on the spread of infections will be crucial.\nThere are separate systems in place in the four UK nations, although the basic principles are the same - a central team of call handlers and contact tracers, supported by local teams who can specialise in handling complex local cases and clusters.\nThe prime minister promised a \"world-beating\" system. \nBut it is clear we are not there yet despite a huge increase in testing and the launch of a contact tracing system in a pretty short period of time. \nEven Baroness Harding, the head of the service in England, admits it is not yet \"gold standard\" - for one thing the contact tracing app that complements the contact tracers is not ready and won't be for months.\nBut the key question is whether it is good enough to contain outbreaks from now on.\nThese systems are only a few weeks old, but have already been busy, tracing nearly 90,000 contacts in England alone. \nWhat is interesting is just how much contact tracing work gets devolved to local teams. \nThe overwhelming majority of the contacts traced in England during the first two weeks were dealt with by councils and local Public Health England teams.\nAn example of how this has worked can be seen in the West Yorkshire town of Cleckheaton.\nThe system was alerted to a cluster of cases, which were then linked to a meat-packing factory in the town.\nOfficials from Public Health England and the local council got involved, the factory was closed down and a mobile testing unit was dispatched to the area. \nHundreds of staff at the factory are being tested - and only those who are negative are being allowed back as it reopens. Close contacts of those who have tested positive have been asked to isolate.\nAdditional measures, including temperature checking and extra social distancing at work, are being introduced.\nAll the signs are this flare-up was caught early - and there is real hope the measures taken have stopped the spread in its tracks.\nBut the big risk in the future is what happens if these sort of measures do not work or if they are taken too late.\nA return to full lockdowns for local areas has been suggested. \nGermany, which has a much stronger track record of containing the virus than the UK, has just announced this for two districts.\nThe UK would be very lucky if it did not have to take this step somewhere. In fact, there is already talk of a local lockdown in Anglesey after a spike in cases.\nThe Association of Directors of Public Health, which represents council public health directors who are in charge of contact tracing at a local level, says this should be seen as part of a normal process of controlling the virus. \nThe important thing is to avoid a big spike where the virus gets out of control.\nThe ADPH would like to see better sharing of information by the national teams so they can keep an eye on who is testing positive and put more testing in place, particularly around care homes so staff and residents can get weekly testing.\nBut if the system works as it should and continues to improve, a second runaway peak should be avoided, but only with the help of the public.\nPublic adherence to the social distancing measures still in place and a willingness to co-operate with the contact tracing system - figures suggest one in four people who test positive do not engage with it - will be essential.\nThe message is clear - we all have a role to play.\nFollow Nick on Twitter\nRead more from Nick",

        "title": "Lifting lockdown: A round-up",
        "description": "Prime Minister Boris Johnson has announced a series of measures to take effect from 4 July, easing the lockdown in England.     \nMeanwhile in Scotland, the five-mile travel limit is set to be lifted from 3 July, with more rules now expected to be eased later in the month.\nFrom 4 July the 2m (6ft) social distancing guidance will change in England. \nThe prime minister said that where it is not possible to stay 2m apart, people should keep a distance of \"one metre plus\" - this means staying one metre apart, while observing precautions to reduce the risk of transmission. \nBusinesses are being asked to help by:\nNorthern Ireland has also announced it will reduce the distancing rule to 1m with restrictions.\nIn Scotland and Wales, the 2m distancing rule remains in place for the time being.\nRestaurants, pubs and cafes in England will also be allowed to reopen, providing they follow safety guidelines.\nAll hospitality indoors will be table service only, and contact between staff and customers will be limited. \nCustomers will also have to give contact details when they enter a pub or restaurant. \nBusinesses will be expected to monitor crowd density in their premises, including at pinch points - such as doorways. \nBusiness Secretary Alok Sharma said he expected people to use \"common sense\". But he added there was a \"legal duty\" for businesses to keep employees safe.\nHoliday accommodation - including hotels, B&Bs, cottages, campsites and caravan parks - can also reopen, and people in England will be free to stay away from home overnight for the first time since lockdown began in March. But shared facilities -  campsite toilets, for instance - must be cleaned properly.\nNorthern Ireland has also said that holiday accommodation can reopen for business from 26 June, and pubs and restaurants can open on 3 July. Decisions on hospitality and holidays in Wales are expected in early July.\nIn Scotland, the hope is that from 15 July all holiday accommodation can open up, along with indoor areas of pubs and restaurants and hairdressers and barbers. Beer gardens should be able to reopen from 6 July. \nShopping centres and dental practices in Scotland could fully re-open from 13 July.\nIn England, two households of any size will be able to meet indoors or outside. It will be possible to stay overnight.\nThis does not have to be the same set of households -  the prime minister said. \"It will be possible for instance to meet one set of grandparents one weekend, and the others the following weekend.\"\nHowever, the government does not not recommend meetings of multiple households indoors because of the risk of infection. \nIn addition, the two households would have to maintain social distancing - unless they were part of the same support bubble. \nOutdoors, people from multiple households can meet in groups of up to six - but two households can meet regardless of size.\nFrom 6 July, people who are clinically vulnerable and are \"shielding\" will be able to gather in groups of up to six people outdoors, including individuals outside of their household, and form a 'support bubble' with one other household.\nIn Scotland, people should be able to meet indoors with two other households from 10 July.\nIn Northern Ireland, groups of up to six people not in the same household can now meet indoors while socially distancing.\nIn Wales, any number of people from two different households can now meet outdoors - but meetings indoors are still not allowed. \nContent available only in the UK",

        "title": "How one neighbourhood is waking up from 'lockdown coma'",
        "description": "As the prime minister announced that pubs and restaurants in England can reopen from 4 July, we went to see how one neighbourhood might emerge from the coronavirus lockdown.\nBrixton appears almost normal. There's a steady stream of people weaving their way in and out of shops - most of which are open. The tangy scent of raw seafood at the fishmongers mixes with that of over-ripe bananas on the fruit stalls. And Whitney Houston songs are blaring out from somewhere, giving the sunny scene an extra zing of flavour and energy. So far, so Brixton. But the many boarded-up businesses down the backstreets of this buzzing south-London neighbourhood are a tell-tale sign of the effect lockdown has had on trade.\nAs general manager of the covered markets that make up Brixton Village, Diana Nabagereka looks out at the hustle and bustle with a smile on her face. \"For the first two weeks of lockdown it was like Brixton was in a coma,\" she says, accepting that people did, at least initially, stay at home. \"But then God made the sun shine and everything changed.\" \nShe says during the warm weather at the beginning of April, she came down from her office in the market to find someone had brought out a sound system to entertain the crowds on Electric Avenue - it was \"like Notting Hill Carnival\".\nDiana says the customers have kept coming partly because the fresh food shops have been able to stay open, as essential businesses. Even so, they've struggled to cope while the 2m social distancing rule has been in place - so she's happy to hear the PM's confirmation that from 4 July, this will reduce to \"one metre plus\". Only five of the 60 restaurants within the market have been able to stay open through lockdown for a takeaway service, so Diana says the change is vital. \nShe adds that while the one-metre rule \"still isn't a perfect situation\" for the market's narrow aisles, she's comfortable that they've made it safe and is delighted by the creative ideas in place to make it financially viable when restaurants reopen. \nFor example, when the butchers next to Honest Burgers closes for the day at about 6pm, Honest Burgers customers will sit down outside it. By sharing space in this way, there'll be room for hundreds of extra customers across the market.\nBut some people aren't so enthused about the return of pubs, restaurants, and many more businesses. In an African fabric shop tucked beneath the railway, owner Rezia says he's convinced business will remain slow for him. It doesn't matter that more people will be out and about spending money - they are not going to buy fabric, he says, on their way home from the pub.\nAcross Brixton Road from Rezia's colourful unit, barber Mark Thomas is also despondent. Shaving his beard inside the tiny barbershop he works in, he says the next couple of weeks will be spent putting signage up, and trying to source visors and gloves, so that they can safely reopen in July. \nMark's only income is from universal credit, as he couldn't afford to take out a government loan designed to help small businesses like his through lockdown: \"I don't want to take any money I'm not going to be able to pay back.\" So while the 4 July announcement can only be good news for the firm, Mark says: \"I'd be happier if it could open tomorrow.\"\nJust up the road from the barbershop, staff at the Duke of Edinburgh pub are much more upbeat. For the past two weeks general manager Fiona Keane and her team have been working in the beer garden, puzzling over how to reopen with either the 2m or 1m social distancing rules in place. \"Now that we've got the information we can just hit the ground running,\" she says.\nThey've got PPE kit for staff and security to wear, signage and hand sanitiser pods are up on the fences of the beer garden, and everyone's \"really excited\" about welcoming customers back, Fiona says. The customers, it appears, are similarly keen - the pub's booking website crashed minutes after Boris Johnson's announcement.\nWhile pubs are itching to throw open their doors, there are other doors in the neighbourhood that remain resolutely shut. There is no date in sight, for example, for the reopening of the O2 Academy - where David Bowie, Kylie Minogue and Diana Ross have all famously graced the stage - or for any of Brixton's popular club nights to return.\n\"Brixton is a night-time economy. Our best side is at night,\" says Michael Smith, director of Brixton BID which represents more than 500 firms. \"Although you are seeing the day-time economy moving along, it's the night-time economy that there's a lot of concern for.\" He adds that the O2 depends on a full house to make money from gigs, which is impossible until social distancing measures come to an end. \"A vaccine is the only thing that's going to allow you to have that.\"\nWithout the night-time buzz, Brixton will struggle to get back on its feet, Michael says. While restaurants and pubs can make a return, he thinks the one-metre rule is not good enough to allow the area to \"get back to the level of vibrancy\" that makes it so unique. \nHe believes in the people of Brixton's ability to innovate, though, and looks forward to creative things venues can do to increase capacity - such as potential plans for more plazas and pedestrianised areas. So, Michael says, he does not feel negative about the prime minister's plans to ease lockdown - but that a sense of anticipation remains about how exactly this corner of London will cope.",

        "title": "'I was scared going back to my job as a carer'",
        "description": "Throughout the pandemic, the UK has depended on its key workers - who are often on low wages and facing difficult personal circumstances. Their diaries catalogue some of the countless sacrifices they have made.\nKayleigh Winters pulled the mask over her mouth and nose, then fastened the face shield above it, and thought about how strange everything felt. \nIt was her first day back at work, caring for elderly people in their homes, after 10 months' maternity leave. When she left to have her daughter in July 2019, no-one had heard of Covid-19. Back then she'd had to wear an apron and gloves during visits, but she'd never needed to cover her face. \nNow she wondered: would her long-standing clients recognise her? Would new ones be frightened of her? Would those with dementia understand what was going on?\nBut while returning to the job mid-pandemic in May 2020 was scary, it was also a relief. \nLockdown had been hard for Kayleigh, 28. As well as her baby daughter, there was also her three-year-old son to look after in the two-bedroom ground-floor maisonette in Plymouth she and her partner Adam Lowther rented from a housing association. Adam, 27, worked nights at a nearby supermarket, and keeping the children quiet while he slept was never easy. Now her maternity leave was over, as she and Adam were classed as key workers, they could make use of nursery places.\nAt the outbreak of the pandemic, the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, which looks for ways of tackling UK poverty, asked key workers around the UK to keep a diary about how they were coping. One day at the height of lockdown, Kayleigh confided in hers.\nWednesday 8 April\nI do feel anxious. When I left last year everything was normal. Now, I'm going to have to return to my kids each night worrying about whether I'm bringing home the virus. In one sense it will be a sort of normality but I'm scared because I will have to put myself out there. But there is no choice. My family can't afford for me not to work.\nEach week, Kayleigh would carefully write out meal plans and take a list to the supermarket. The pandemic hadn't affected their weekly budget much but she and Adam were used to living month to month. She'd stick to supermarket brands and cook batches of spag bol or curry that she could make last.\nLooking after the three-year-old was the biggest challenge. The tantrums were fearsome when they came. He was old enough to know that something was going on, but too young to understand exactly what it was. The routine of his normal life - nursery, friends, older relatives - had disappeared. \nFriday 10 April\nWe'd give anything for a garden to sit in right now - it would be so lovely to have that bit of space which is our own. We just have our daily walk which is the highlight of the day. I feel like I'm grieving for our old life.\nThe easing of the lockdown restrictions at the start of June made everything slightly easier. The family could take trips to the seaside and Kayleigh could visit her parents in their back garden. But still, the baby's grandparents hadn't held her or her brother for months. \nAnd each time Kayleigh went to work, the responsibility she felt towards her older clients weighed heavier than ever.\n\"Some days I feel really anxious, and other days I wake up and think: 'Well, I just can't think about this today,'\" she says. \"I don't like the feeling of uncertainty. I don't deal well with that at all.\"\nIt was 6am when Owiya Kambeja woke on the floor of his lounge. Through the wall, in the flat's only bedroom, his 11-year-old son and eight-year-old daughter were still asleep. Owiya's body felt stiff, but he was used to these living arrangements by now. The hardest thing about it was starting the day in an upbeat frame of mind. Still, he'd long ago trained himself to suppress any negative emotions whenever they started to bubble up.\nFor 10 years Owiya, 62, had lived in this one-bedroom flat on the first floor of a tower block on Tottenham's Broadwater Farm estate. Each time he asked the council for a larger property, the answer was always the same: \"Nothing available.\" It was hard enough raising two growing children here before the novel coronavirus arrived. Now, it was a daily struggle.\nAt 8am the children would wake up, make their beds and share warm milk and chocolate bread for breakfast. Owiya had drawn up a strict routine for them. An educated man himself, Owiya was keen they didn't fall behind on their lessons now the schools had closed. But it was difficult with no laptop - theirs had been damaged beyond repair in a flood the previous year. They would have to do their best with two mobile phones between the three of them.\nThursday 9 April\nWe have an old exercise bike which we store in the bathroom and the children take turns to ride it each day. We feel so lucky to have it because it is not safe for them to go outside on this estate for a number of reasons.\nBroadwater Farm is a dense housing estate and the virus is probably spreading here very quickly. There are still boys sitting outside in groups of 10-15 on a daily basis. This place is not safe at all. All we can do is keep praying it doesn't come to our door.\nAfter moving to the UK from Uganda in 2002, Owiya studied for a degree in oil and gas management, but as a lone parent - his wife had been refused a visa - he hadn't been able to take up the jobs he was offered in Iraq and other high-risk places. When the pandemic broke out, he'd been working in a day centre for people with learning disabilities. \nOn 16 March, he received a call from his employer telling him that staff were being \"reduced\". Three months later, he still hadn't managed to get a straight answer from them about furlough pay. \nSaturday 11 April\nWe had toast and milk for supper with some salad on the side. I try to make sure the children have the most balanced diet I can give them but this is going to get harder at a time when they need the vitamins to boost their immune system the most.\nAs the lockdown became less restrictive Owiya's life became slightly easier. But still, when he lay down to sleep on the living room floor each night, he was kept awake thinking about what would happen if he or one of his children caught the virus.\n\"We know that when you're infected with Covid-19, you're not supposed to go out. You must isolate yourself inside. But for people in a single-bedroom flat with children, how is it really possible?\"\nEarly in the pandemic, Charlotte Pilling began to notice the butterflies in her stomach; around the same time she started noticing she was shaking, too. There hasn't been a day since then, she says, when she hasn't felt both sensations.\nCharlotte, 40, from Blackpool, Lancashire, was an outdoor person, used to picnics and walking the dog for hours, and a sociable soul, too. \"I like going to people's houses and having a quick brew and catching up on gossip, do you know what I mean?\" she says. \"It's been quite hard not doing that, as well.\"\nThere was another big adjustment to make. Until Covid-19 arrived, the only time she'd ever not worked was when she took maternity leave. She'd always had a job and had assumed that she always would. Feeling vulnerable and dependent was new to her, and it was hard.\nBut early in the pandemic her hours as a school cook were cut to 16 a week. Her partner, Justin Hindel, 35, an air conditioning unit engineer, had his hours halved. Making ends meet became a struggle. She'd spend an hour and a half on the phone at a time trying to claim Universal Credit.\nOn top of all this, she had her two children aged 11 and eight to teach. There were mobile phones in the house but no computer. The wifi wasn't great.\nMonday 6 April\nSome days I've been close to tears because I don't understand the work that has been set. I can't cope with it, I just don't have the knowledge. It takes me a whole day to do two pieces of work.\nLast week, I'm ashamed to say I got so frustrated with a project my daughter needed to do on extinct animals that I stormed off like a 10-year-old. And as for fractions, it's like a foreign language to me.\nBecause both parents were classed as key workers - Justin does repairs in a local supermarket - their children were able to return to classes in early April. But it wasn't long before another child in their school tested positive for Covid-19, and they had to stay home for another fortnight.\nThursday 9 April\nOur kids have always been able to go to the fridge and get what they want but during the last couple of weeks we've had to tell them to slow down. It's a sign that things are getting harder for us financially and so it's essential we keep working. \nThere is a food bank at my children's school and this afternoon I took some bread, oatcakes and fresh fruit. This is a huge help to us and we are very grateful.\nWhen the rules on going outdoors were relaxed, Charlotte didn't feel quite so claustrophobic. But then she saw the piles of rubbish on Blackpool beach and wondered what had happened to social distancing. She feared a second wave.\n\"I'm literally just taking each day as it comes,\" she says. \"If this is going to be my normal life for the next six to 12 months I'm just going to have to get used to it.\"\nIt had been a rare day off with her family for Justyna Kmietowicz, and a happy one, until she made the mistake of watching the news.\nJustyna, 43, was a social care support worker in Taunton, Somerset, helping clients with conditions like autism to live independently. She enjoyed her work but the fear of catching the virus loomed over her. Today was an opportunity to put it to the back of her mind and spend time with her four children. They'd splashed around in the paddling pool and made a barbecue.\nThen the news bulletin came on. It gave the latest official figures for hospital and care home deaths. It brought home her anxieties about how the pandemic was being handled from the top. \nShe didn't want the children to see she how scared she was, so she carried on smiling.\nFriday 10 April\nIt was really hard leaving for work today. We lost one of our clients to Covid yesterday and my 10-year-old son has also been watching a lot of news on the television. He is getting very anxious about me going to work. He begs me: \"Mum, please don't go to work. Stay home so you won't get sick.\" I tell him I will be fine and need to support the family but it breaks my heart to think he is worried. Eventually, he gives me a hug and just says: \"I love you mum. Be safe.\" It brings a tear to my eye.\nJustyna had only started her job back in February. Previously she'd worked in McDonald's, and while switching to the care sector as a pandemic broke out was a huge challenge, she found the role rewarding. The hardest thing about it was working with a face screen, which made it difficult to breathe.\nShe'd lived in the UK for 12 years after arriving from Poland. She was determined to make Britain her home. But the Brexit years had made her feel uneasy. Her children had worried they would be sent back. Now she felt as though she was needed, but the future was still uncertain.\nThursday 16 April\nWe all joined Clap for Carers tonight and have done so from the beginning. It makes me really proud of my children when they say: \"Mum, we clap for you, for all your hard work.\" Of course I'd prefer a pay rise but I know this won't happen.\nPhotos by Marc Giddings.\nFollow @mrjonkelly on Twitter",

        "title": "TikTok star 'glad' she shared sexual assault story",
        "description": "\"I felt pressured into sharing, but I'm kind of glad it happened.\"\nIn May, TikTok star Loren Gray revealed she had been sexually assaulted at the age of 12. \nIt was only after receiving a message that someone knew and might share her story \"in the wrong way\", that she decided to speak.\nIn her only interview about it since, the 18-year-old tells Radio 1 Newsbeat she's grateful for the positive response. \n\"It was really difficult for me, because I didn't know what to expect. And I was afraid that people were going to look at me differently.\"\n\"I wasn't prepared for it, you never can be. It was hard but I feel like I handled it in the best way I could.\"\nIn the TikTok video, Loren wrote she was assaulted in a basement belonging to somebody she trusted.\n\"I struggled to put the pieces together as to why this had happened to me. I felt dirty, hopeless, broken, and worthless,\" the American added on the video.\nLoren didn't tell anyone, including her parents, that she was planning on sharing publicly what happened to her.\n\"I just went for it because at the end of the day, it's my story. So it's on me when I share.\n\"But my parents were really proud,\" she adds.\nthank you. pic.twitter.com/s3qDMXadfu\nEnd of Twitter post  by @iamlorengray\nLoren says she hasn't reported what happened to the authorities.\n\"I didn't because at the time, it wasn't right for my healing process.\"\nBut she knows reporting \"can help and be right for other people\".\nCircumstances were different for her because her parents \"had never dealt with anything\" like that so they \"were really unsure about what to do\".\n\"By the time I told anyone, it had already been a couple of months. I just wanted to move forward.\"\nLoren has more than 60 million followers across her social media pages. Since sharing, she says many of her fans have told their own stories of being sexually assaulted.\nIt shows \"you never really know what's going on in someone's life\".\n\"But I'm glad I could help people share their own stories, because it's something that happens to a lot of people.\"\nIf you need support with any of the issues raised in this article, these organisations may be able to help.\nAccording to the Rape, Abuse & Incest National Network, 15% of sexual assault victims in the US are aged between 12 and 17.\nInitially, Loren blamed herself for the assault. She says there are always questions inside about what could have happened instead.\n\"You ask 'What if I did this differently, or what would have happened if I did something else?'\"\n\"It's a natural feeling. But it takes a lot of learning and realisation to realise it's not your fault and talking to people really helps.\"\nHaving other people hear what she was going through helped ease some of those feelings.\n\"Even though it's really difficult for people to understand, for me, talking to my parents was really hard, but in the end was like therapy.\"\nThe other thing which helped Loren was making videos, which she started doing a few months after the incident to pass time when being home schooled.\n\"I feel making videos separated the two worlds, especially once I started gaining a following.\n\"It helped me separate what I was feeling and the life that I could have.\"\nShe credits her fans for helping her get through a tough time. \n\"They didn't know what had happened, so they were just there to support me in what I was doing and what I'm passionate about, which is making videos.\"\nThe most important thing for Loren was to not let what happened control her future.\n\"I know that especially at the time, it feels really life defining.\" \n\"You'll look at yourself differently, even thinking other people are looking at you differently, even when they aren't,\" she adds.\n\"But it's important to know that's not always the case. There's always a light at the end of the tunnel.\"\nFollow Newsbeat on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter and YouTube.\nListen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 weekdays - or listen back here.",

        "title": "Glastonbury 2021 will be 'a double celebration'",
        "description": "Next year's Glastonbury festival will be a \"double celebration\", organiser Emily Eavis has told the BBC.\nThe festival was due to be celebrating its 50th anniversary this weekend, with headline sets from Paul McCartney, Taylor Swift and Kendrick Lamar.\nInstead, it was called off in March as the coronavirus pandemic took hold.\n\"Having to cancel was quite gutting,\" Eavis told BBC Music. \"But the first year back after what we've been through will be the most amazing party.\n\"We all need it, the public need it, we all need that kind of connection. We need to be together. \n\"Being forced to be in lockdown and everything we've all gone through together has made those things all the more precious.\"\nShe hinted that next year's line-up could be one of the most spectacular yet, with sets delayed from this year's festival combined with the artists already booked for 2021.\n\"Because we're rolling two festivals together, we've got a hell of a lot of surprises that we were planning for the 50th and I think we're going to try and get those things going for next year,\" she told BBC 6 Music.\n\"Logistically it's a little bit complicated because we'd already pencilled in many, many of the acts for 2021... so we're trying to work out how much we can fit into next year.\nEavis said she \"really hopes\" Paul McCartney can return to headline the Pyramid Stage next year, but admitted the festival faced \"choppy waters\" in preparing for 2021.\n\"It's a little bit unknown as to where we're going to be, so we're optimistic - but we're not going too far down that road at the moment.\"\nMore than 200,000 people, including 135,000 ticket-holders, would have descended on Worthy Farm in Somerset if the festival had gone ahead this weekend.\nFans who bought tickets or paid deposits for this year's event have been allowed to roll those over to next year. Any returned or cancelled tickets will be put on sale later this year.\nMarcus Mumford, who was due to play a surprise set with Mumford and Sons at the festival, said he was gutted to be missing out.\n\"It would sort of be alright if it was anything other than Glastonbury,\" he told BBC Breakfast, \"but Glastonbury for us, especially as a band, we always set out hearts on it.\n\"You know, it's the highlight. It's the best festival in the world.\" \nTo mark what would have been Glastonbury weekend, the BBC is repeating dozens of classic sets from the festival's history on TV, radio and the iPlayer over the next four days.\nPerformances by David Bowie, Beyonce, Kylie Minogue, Adele, Jay-Z The Rolling Stones, Stormzy and Arctic Monkeys will be broadcast over the weekend, alongside documentaries and acoustic performances from the BBC's archive.\n\"We're going to be catching up on loads of old sets online,\" said Eavis. \"I'm really pleased the BBC have managed to put so many sets up because... we never watch the coverage when everyone else is watching at home.\n\"So it's actually a really nice opportunity to be able to sit down and watch some of that, and reflect on all those moments from Oasis to Springsteen, Adele, Amy Winehouse - so many good ones over the years.\n\"It's a good time to take it all in.\"\nIn a separate interview with the NME Eavis said this year's festival would have reflected the Black Lives Matter movement, had it gone ahead.\n\"There are so many issues at the moment and I know that we would have been continuing our campaigning on climate change and expanding our work banning the use of plastic across the site. \n\"We have also been very inspired by Black Lives Matter and working as festival in the fight against racism, so that would have been prominent in our plans too.\"\nFollow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

        "title": "Sun-seekers urged to stay away from packed beach",
        "description": "Sun-seekers have been urged to stay away from a beach as thousands flocked to the Dorset coast and a major incident was declared in Bournemouth.\nBournemouth Christchurch and Poole Council said Bournemouth Beach was \"stretched to the absolute hilt\" on the second day of a UK heatwave.\nDorset Police said there were reports of gridlocked roads, fights and overnight camping.\nPeople were urged to \"act responsibly\" as temperatures hit the mid-20s.\nTraffic built up early on coast-bound roads - including Durdle Door - and people travelled to Bournemouth from as far as Birmingham.\nBy Thursday evening the Sandbanks peninsula was \"heavily congested\", the council said, repeating its warning for people to \"please stay away\".\nThe ferry service in Sandbanks tweeted: \"Again we're struggling to get traffic off the ferry at Poole, for now we hope to carry half loads of vehicles from Studland, but depends on the gridlock in Sandbanks tonight.\"\nA local resident took a photo of the lengthy queue for the Mudeford ferry as beach-goers left for the day. \nThe council said declaring a major incident meant a \"multi-agency emergency response has now been activated to co-ordinate resources across the area to tackle the issues\".\nEngland's Chief Medical Officer, Professor Chris Whitty, tweeted in response to Thursday's beach scenes with a warning Covid-19 \"will rise again\" unless people followed social distancing guidelines.\nCouncil leader Vikki Slade said they were \"absolutely appalled at the scenes witnessed on our beaches\". \n\"The irresponsible behaviour and actions of so many people is just shocking and our services are stretched to the absolute hilt trying to keep everyone safe. We have had no choice now but to declare a major incident and initiate an emergency response,\" she added. \nThe council said it issued a record 558 parking fines. \nIt said 33 tonnes of waste was cleaned up along the coastline on Thursday morning, along with eight tonnes collected between the piers on Wednesday.\n‘MAJOR INCIDENT’ declared in BOURNEMOUTH - pls stay away.With 1/2 million visitors in Dorset, roads are gridlocked, hindering emergency vehicles & beaches are full - with Dispersal Orders on both piers.I’ve asked Police Minister to dispatch additional police if Dorset requests pic.twitter.com/YnSpfdXOLc\nEnd of Twitter post  by @Tobias_Ellwood\nBournemouth East MP Tobias Ellwood said he had asked the government to dispatch additional officers to Dorset if needed to deal with traffic and antisocial behaviour.\n\"It is very sad to see a number of people being selfish and also acting dangerously,\" he said.\nMr Ellwood said it was \"not practical\" to close Dorset's beaches altogether but suggested signs warning about overcrowding could be put up at railway stations and on approaching motorways.\nHe added the government needed to be \"dynamic\" in its response to beach crowding, otherwise the lockdown would have \"been for nothing\". \n\"I'm sorry to see the departure of the No 10 briefings because they would have been perfect for today - for a key figure in No 10 to clarify what is actually happening in Bournemouth and to clarify that message nationally - to say 'please for the moment stay away from all our seafronts',\" he said. \nExtra police officers have been brought in and security is in place to protect refuse crews who the council said faced \"widespread abuse and intimidation\" as they emptied overflowing bins. \nThe Royal Bournemouth Hospital and Poole Hospital confirmed they had declared a \"major incident standby\".\nIn a joint statement, the hospital trusts said this was due to \"the impact of extremely crowded beaches, traffic gridlock on roads... the number of incidents of public disorder and risks from fire and to public health.\"\nAssistant Chief Constable Sam de Reya, of Dorset Police, said people should stay away from beaches in these \"unprecedented times\".\n\"Clearly we are still in a public health crisis and such a significant volume of people heading to one area places a further strain on emergency services resources,\" she said.\nPhotographs showed beaches and beauty spots heaving with people on Wednesday, which was the UK's hottest day of the year so far.\nDavid Morley, who lives in Sandbanks, said: \"What we saw was a complete breakdown of normal decent behaviour and law and order - it's completely swamping the system.\"\nLIVE: Thousands flock to beaches in heatwave\nThe chain ferry linking Sandbanks and Studland was unable to carry vehicles late into Wednesday evening because of the gridlock on surrounding roads. There were also reports of illegal overnight camping on Bournemouth beach.\nElsewhere along the coast, police at Hove Lawns seafront put a dispersal order in place after a large gathering.\nFrom Bournemouth pier there are thousands of people as far as the eye can see. Some in the sea on inflatables, others sitting on the sand, there are significant [numbers of] gazebos - there is one group of about 50 people.\nOne man told me he camped in a tent overnight, a lot of people have come from Birmingham - a six-hour round trip. People were telling me they wanted to get \"out and about\" after lockdown.\nIt's incredibly hard to keep social distancing  - people are passing each other certainly at less than 2m.\nOne woman from Birmingham admitted she felt uncomfortable, but said: \"You've got to understand, after three months lockdown in the city centre, even seeing the sea is worth it.\"\nDorset councillor Laura Miller said she was verbally abused and spat at as she directed traffic at Durdle Door on Wednesday. \nRoads to the beauty spot were closed after people failed to use the pre-booking parking system.\n\"Our local industry is dependent on tourism - we're not saying 'don't come', but come here in a safe and managed way. When it's too busy, no-one is having fun,\" she said.\nThe car park was approaching capacity again by mid-morning on Thursday.\nCurrent government guidelines state households can drive any distance in England to parks and beaches.\nEarlier this month, both Dorset councils called on the government to impose travel restrictions, raising concerns that visitor numbers could increase Covid-19 cases in the county.\nFollow BBC South on Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram.

        "description": "Rumours circulating about the search for a 14-year-old boy who went missing in Belfast on Sunday are \"extremely unhelpful and distressing for his family\", police have said.\nOfficers believe Noah Donohoe may have fallen from his bicycle and sustained an injury, causing him to remove his clothing.\nHe was last seen in areas close to the Shore Road at 18:11 BST.\nPolice have encouraged people to search properties, gardens and sheds. \nPolice have also appealed to Noah's friends to get in touch with them if they have any information. \nBut in a statement on Thursday afternoon, Supt Muir Clark asked the public to give police and specialist search and rescue teams the space to carry out their work.\nHe added that the investigation remained a missing persons inquiry.\nA number of items belonging to the St Malachy's College pupil - including his black Apollo mountain bike and some clothing - have been found. \nBut a green North Face jacket, grey sweat shorts with an emblem on one leg and a khaki rucksack containing a Lenovo laptop and a copy of the book 12 Rules for Life by Jordan Peterson, are still missing. \nHe had also been wearing a black skateboarding helmet, a blue and navy hooded top and Nike trainers with a bright yellow tick.\nSupt Clark said that it is \"still not entirely clear\" why the 14-year-old travelled to the area where he went missing.\n\"He went to school in north Belfast but at this time I can find no connection between the Northwood area and Noah's knowledge of north Belfast,\" he added.\nHe said that police had received a \"significant amount of dashcam footage,\" and had \"received and discounted\" a number of potential sightings. \nHe added that police had a \"number of hypotheses,\" as to what may have happened.\n\"The one we are majoring on is that he has in some way suffered a head injury\" which led to him being \"disorientated,\" he said.\nAnyone with information on Noah's whereabouts is asked to contact police immediately on 101.\nSpecialist teams, police and community rescue services are involved in Thursday's ongoing search.\n\"Police officers supported by air support unit, police dogs and our tactical support group have been searching the area alongside Community Rescue Service colleagues and local volunteers,\" said the PSNI.\nThe search around the Shore Road area of north Belfast was being extended as far as the Antrim Road and city centre, Sean McCarry from Community Search and Rescue told BBC News NI.\nSt Malachy's College said the community was praying that Noah was found and returned safely to his family soon.\nA statement from the school described him as a personable, good-humoured and very kind person as well as a talented cellist \"who displays impressive competitive and athletic skills on the sports field\".\nAt the scene: BBC News NI reporter Catherine Morrison\nToday, it's really been so much quieter here.\nIt's a total contrast to yesterday when hundreds and hundreds of people were in this area as part of that massive community search effort to try and find Noah.\nLast night police and search rescue teams asked those volunteers to essentially take a step back and let them take the lead in the operation to find Noah.\nThat seems to certainly have been heeded here today.\nThe local community centre, the Hubb, remains open for rescue teams who need to take a break or grab a bottle of water and members of Noah's family, who were there last night.\nIts manager, Colleen Crothers, said yesterday they had people from Portavogie, west Belfast and Ballymena joining local residents in the search.\nAlso taking part were people who have had things like this happen in their family and who had come from \"everywhere and anywhere\".\nHaving left his home in south Belfast at about 17:30, Noah was reportedly seen passing through Ormeau Avenue in Belfast at about 17:45. \nHe crossed the city, going through the heart of the city along Royal Avenue and then on to North Street.\nHe then made his way towards the north of the city going along North Queen Street.\nAn eye witness reported a young man fitting his description falling off his bicycle in the North Queen Street/York Road area. He then went on to the Limestone Road.\nNoah was reportedly seen riding his bicycle in the Northwood Road area, apparently having abandoned all his clothing. \nIt is suggested he may have got off his bike and left the area on foot. The last reported sighting was at about 18:10.\nFirst Minister Arlene Foster said Noah's family faced the \"worst kind of nightmare\".\n\"I would appeal to those of you to have unoccupied houses to check them, as well as garages, gardens or outhouses in the north of the city, just in case Noah is there,\" she told Stormont's daily coronavirus press briefing.\n\"I send my prayerful support to Noah's family and friends to stay strong in what I can only imagine is the most distressing of situations. Please know that everyone stands with you, and the safe return of Noah is very much uppermost in our thoughts.\"\nDeputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill also sent her thoughts to Noah's family and friends.\n\"We can only imagine the heartbreak being felt by his family,\" she said.",

        "title": "Unilever drops 'fair' from skin cream after backlash",
        "description": "Unilever will rename Fair & Lovely, a skin-lightening cream which has been criticised for promoting negative stereotypes around dark skin tones.\nIt will also remove references to \"whitening\" or \"lightening\" on the products, which are sold across Asia.\nUnilever acknowledged the branding suggests \"a singular ideal of beauty\".\nTwo separate petitions urging Unilever to stop the production of its Fair & Lovely range have been signed by more than 18,000 people in recent weeks.\n\"This product has built upon, perpetuated and benefited from internalised racism and promotes anti-blackness sentiments,\" one says.\nA second petition claimed the cream \"tells us that there is something wrong with our color, that we have to be light in order to feel beautiful. In order to feel worthy.\"\nSunny Jain, President of Beauty & Personal Care at Unilever, said: \"We are fully committed to having a global portfolio of skin care brands that is inclusive and cares for all skin tones, celebrating greater diversity of beauty. \n\"We recognise that the use of the words 'fair', 'white' and 'light' suggest a singular ideal of beauty that we don't think is right, and we want to address this.\"\n\"The brand has never been and is not a bleaching product,\" Unilever added.\nThe consumer goods giant also said that it had removed before-and-after impressions and \"shade guides\" on Fair & Lovely packaging in 2019. The skin care range is sold across countries such as India, Indonesia, Thailand and Pakistan.\nUnilever's move comes as cosmetics firms around the world reassess their product lines and marketing strategies in light of the Black Lives Matters movement, sparked by George Floyd's death.\nGeorge Floyd died in Minneapolis in May as a white police officer held a knee on his neck for nearly nine minutes.\nThe final moments were filmed on phones. Four police officers involved have been sacked and charged over his death.\nWriter and activist Poorna Bell said that Unilever's announcement was \"hugely disappointing\".\n\"It doesn't do enough to make reparations for the untold mental and emotional damage done by colourism,\" a prejudice or discrimination against individuals with a dark skin tone, often among people of the same ethnic group.\n\"Renaming the products doesn't mean anything - that's still just colourism by another word,\" she said.\nShe also called for Unilever to match Johnson & Johnson's recent commitment to stop selling certain products that are advertised as dark-spot reducers in Asia and the Middle East, but have been used by consumers to lighten skin tone.\nSkin-lightening products are typically aimed at women in the Black and Asian communities, says Dr Steve Garner, a sociologist, who carried out one of the first British studies into skin-lightening.\nNivea's parent company Beiersdorf told the BBC that it \"stands against racism and discrimination of any kind and supports the Black Lives Matter movement.\"\nNivea's Natural Fairness line is sold in the Middle East, India as well as Nigeria and Ghana.\nOn its Middle East website, the product is described as being able to \"prevent the darkening of skin tone\". \nWhen asked by the BBC if it would amend the description, Nivea said that the product contains SPF-15 \"which helps prevent sun-induced skin damage, such as irregular dark pigmentation, for any skin type.\"\nIt added: \"We are currently doing a review in all our products descriptions and are in the process of re-evaluating and updating the description that may cause any misinterpretation.\"\nL'Oreal did not respond to the BBC's request for comment on its Garnier White Complete range.\nIn a YouTube video advertising the range, cartoon images of women are put side-by-side, claiming that the products can \"brighten\"  the skin.\n\"The language around these products upholds the beauty standards that lighter or whiter skin is more desirable,\" Nomshado Michelle Baca, the founder of beauty brand A Complexion Company.\n\"The individual who formulated and marketed the products is not likely to be a person of colour, resulting in a warped perception that all black women desire lighter skin.\"\nBut she argues that the conversation has become \"hyper-focused on the change of someone's entire complexion. \n\"The woman who wants to treat small areas of scarring is left invisible and without options but to use the damaging products available in unregulated retailers or black hair shops.\"\nUnless they are issued on prescription by a doctor, creams containing hydroquinone, steroids or mercury are banned in the UK - because of their potentially serious side-effects.\nConsumers have previously been warned by the Local Government Association to steer clear of those toxic products that can \"act like paint stripper\".\nBBC News identified products containing the bleaching agent hydroquinone available to UK customers on online marketplace EBay.\nA spokesperson for EBay told the BBC: \"Only items that comply with the law are allowed to be listed on eBay and any products containing hydroquinone, steroids or mercury are banned. \n\"Listings containing these ingredients were immediately removed and we are taking enforcement action against the sellers. We work closely with regulatory authorities including Trading Standards and the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency to keep our community safe.\"\nThey added that EBay has been updating its \"offensive materials policy\" in recent weeks in light of the Black Lives Matter movement.\n\"In the bigger picture, companies should have been doing these things, such as weeding out potentially poisonous products, a long time ago,\" Dr Steve Garner added.\n\"Realistically, these commitments will have very little impact for a global company.\"",

        "title": "We're taking coronavirus seriously, says beauty firm",
        "description": "Skincare firm Dermalogica has urged the UK to give beauty salons and spas a date for reopening as coronavirus lockdown measures ease.\nHairdressers, pubs and restaurants in England will be allowed to reopen on 4 July with safety measures in place.\nIn an open letter to the government, Dermalogica UK wrote: \"We assure you, we are taking coronavirus seriously.\"\nThe firm said there was \"confusion\" around why beauty salons are not allowed to reopen next month.\nWriting to Business Secretary Alok Sharma, Dermalogica UK's general manager Hermann questioned why \"one-to-one services in a highly sanitised environment\" would put consumers more at risk of contracting the coronavirus, than a restaurant or pub with minimal social distancing measures.\n\"The industry, which has a strong and existing standard on hygiene and sanitation, has been active in preparing to go back to work safely,\" he said.\nDermalogica stocks skincare products and treatments for acne in more than 5,500 spas and beauty salons across the UK.\nSpeaking in the House of Commons on Tuesday, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said that contact services, such as nail bars or spas, would not be able to open until the government could confirm they \"can operate in a coronavirus-secure way\".\nBut beauty and wellness industries argue that they require \"clarity on whether it will be possible to remain in business\", said Mr Hermann.\nIn a survey of the businesses Dermalogica UK works with, 6% have said they will be forced to close as a result of coronavirus-related lockdown measures.\nBeautician Tara Williamson is frustrated by what she sees as a double standard from government, with hairdressers allowed to reopen, but beauty salons staying closed.\nShe runs The Beauty, Skin and Eyelash Lounge in Epping, Essex and had planned to open on 4 July.\n\"It just seems crazy that we have no guidelines of when we can open and what is going to be happening,\" she told the BBC. \n\"I don't see a reason why we couldn't open and it will obviously be a big blow.\"\nThe prime minister said on Tuesday that the government's public health experts will work with sectors which remain closed, to help them open \"as soon as possible\".\nBBC News has contacted the Department for Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy for comment.",

        "title": "US threatens tariffs on EU beer, gin and olives",
        "description": "The US has threatened new trade tariffs on beer, chocolate and olives from the European Union, as part of a long-running row over subsidies to planemaker Airbus.\nThe US Trade Representative said it was considering duties on 30 products worth $3.1bn (£2.5bn) in trade every year. \nIt has already put 15% to 25% tariffs on $7.5bn worth of other EU goods as part of the dispute.\nThe EU warned it would damage firms on both side of the Atlantic.\nAnd UK Trade Minister Liz Truss said she was disappointed by the move, warning against the use of \"tit-for-tat\" tariffs.\nThe row centres on EU subsidies given to Airbus before 2004, which Washington says created an unfair advantage over the US aircraft manufacturer Boeing.\nLast year, the World Trade Organization (WTO) ruled the subsidies were illegal and allowed the US to levy tariffs on EU goods, including aircraft, wines and cheese.\nBut it is now considering a parallel case involving illegal support for Boeing, which could see the EU imposing duties later this year.\nThe US said pastry and cakes, gin, cashmere clothes and hardware products could all be in the firing line for new tariffs, affecting exporters across the continent.  \nIn a statement the EU said Washington was going beyond what was allowed by the WTO.\n\"It creates uncertainty for companies and inflicts unnecessary economic damage on both sides of the Atlantic,\" it added.\n\"This is particularly the case as companies are now trying to overcome the economic difficulties in the aftermath of the Covid-19 crisis.\"\nSince 2017, the US has been embroiled in a damaging trade war with China, which it accuses of unfair trade practices and intellectual property theft. However, it has also trained it fire on allies including the EU. \nBefore last year's tariffs over Airbus, the Trump administration had imposed duties on EU steel and aluminium - spurring Brussels to tax iconic US products such as denim jeans and motorcycles.\nMr Trump has also threatened duties on European cars, a particular concern to Germany. \nUS-levied tariffs are paid by US businesses, which in turn may pass those costs on to consumers. The Distilled Spirits Council of the United States said its members had been hit hard by the Airbus-Boeing spat.\n\"EU and US distilled spirits companies have suffered enough as a result of this trade war. The longer these disputes go unresolved, the greater the threat of even more tariffs on our industry.\"",

        "description": "Scandal-hit payments firm Wirecard has filed for insolvency, causing its shares to dive almost 80%.\nIt comes after the German firm last week disclosed a €1.9bn (£1.7bn) hole in its accounts.\nFormer boss Markus Braun has since been arrested and accused of inflating Wirecard's finances to make them appear healthier to investors and customers.\nThe firm's creditors stand to lose billions of euros from the scandal.\nThe controversy erupted last week when auditors EY refused to sign off on firm's company's accounts, having been unable to locate the missing €1.9bn.\nThe Munich based firm, which employs almost 6,000 staff in 26 countries, initially claimed the money was held in accounts at two banks in the Philippines.\nBut on Monday Wirecard said the money simply may not exist.\nIn a statement on Thursday, the firm said its new management had decided to apply for insolvency at a Munich court \"due to impending insolvency and over-indebtedness\".\nThe firm is also evaluating whether to file for insolvency proceedings for its subsidiaries.\nWirecard, which was launched as a start-up in 1999, joined Germany's prestigious Dax 30 share index two years ago at a valuation of €24bn. \nBut the company's shares have crashed almost 100% in the last week, giving it a stock market valuation of less than €400m.\nThe Munich prosecutor's office, which is investigating Mr Braun, said it had now widened its investigation to look at others. \nFormer chief operating officer Jan Marsalek is under suspicion and believed to be in the Philippines, according to the Reuters news agency. \nMeanwhile, Mr Braun has been freed on bail of €5m and remains a suspect.

        "title": "Qantas to cut 6,000 jobs due to virus impact",
        "description": "Qantas will axe 6,000 jobs as part of its plans to survive the coronavirus pandemic, the airline says.\nThe cuts equate to about a fifth of the airline's workforce prior to the Covid-19 crisis. In March, it furloughed more than 80% of its staff.\nAustralia's national carrier said the collapse in global air travel had devastated revenues.\nLast week, the Australian government said its border would most likely remain closed into next year.\nIt prompted Qantas to cancel all international flights until late October, except for those to New Zealand.\nOn Thursday, chief executive Alan Joyce said the airline expected smaller revenues in the next three years, forcing it to become a smaller operation to survive.\n\"The actions we must take will have a huge impact on thousands of our people,\" he said in a statement.\n\"But the collapse in billions of dollars in revenue leaves us little choice if we are to save as many jobs as possible, long term.\"\nMr Joyce added that Qantas, and its budget subsidiary Jetstar, would continue to extend a furlough for about 15,000 workers \"as we wait for the recovery we know is coming\".\nAustralia has flattened its virus curve faster than other nations, meaning demand for domestic flights has returned and is expected to fully recover by 2022. \nBut international demand at that time is forecast to be half of what it was, Qantas said.\nThe airline also plans to raise A$1.9bn (£1.05bn; $1.3bn) in equity - its first such move in 10 years - to bring in new funds and help \"accelerate\" its recovery.\nOther short-term savings will be found by grounding up to 100 planes, including its A380 fleet, and deferring the purchase of new planes, it said.\nGreg Waldron, Asia managing editor of FlightGlobal, told the BBC that the measures should help support the airline as it deals with the fallout from the pandemic.\n\"Qantas's mix of job cuts, fleet reductions, and capital raising are designed to reduce costs during a demand crisis for the industry, and retain a solid core for the eventual rebound. In the short to medium term, Australia's strong domestic market should help Qantas's revenue partially revive.\"\nSimon Atkinson, BBC News in Sydney\nAustralia's borders remain pretty much shut in and out - apart from returning citizens or for passengers with exceptional circumstances. And the comments by Qantas today are telling.\nBy grounding most of its international fleet \"for at least the next year\", the airline is clearly not expecting international borders to open up in a meaningful way until at least June 2021.\nShould the much talked-about trans-Tasman bubble between Australia and New Zealand open up, Qantas will doubtless be part of that.\nBut for non-Australians hoping to visit family abroad - or for Aussies eyeing a holiday to Bali - there's no need to pack the passport for a while yet. \nOf course today the biggest thoughts go to the 6,000 or so Qantas staff who are losing their jobs, and the 15,000 employees who remain stood down.\nMr Joyce is hopeful about half of that latter group will be back helping the airline run domestic routes by the end of the year on the back of ramped-up demand to fly around this vast country. That hinges on Australia's states opening borders to allow free travel. \nAnd that depends on Australia keeping Covid-19 well under control - so outbreaks like the one we're seeing right now in Melbourne do not become the norm.\nThe airline said its massive loyalty programme - which has 13 million members or around half Australia's population - would be its best hope of recovery while borders remain closed.\nAustralia's other large carrier, Virgin Australia, slumped into voluntary administration in April and is currently undergoing a sale process.\nThe International Air Transport Association (IATA) - the peak body for airlines - has warned that global airline revenue has seen a 55% decline on 2019 levels. IATA says it will take more than three years for global travel to return to 2019 levels.\nAviation industry analyst Shukor Yusof from Endau Analytics warned that worse is still to come for the world's airlines as they deal with the impact of the coronavirus.\n\"The crisis is deeper and wider than what many think it is, and it will have a debilitating effect on the industry. We are seeing just the beginning of what is going to be at least 12 to 18 months of pain and suffering before airlines slowly recover.\"",

        "description": "Unilever will rename Fair & Lovely, a skin-lightening cream which has been criticised for promoting negative stereotypes around dark skin tones.\nIt will also remove references to \"whitening\" or \"lightening\" on the products, which are sold across Asia.\nUnilever acknowledged the branding suggests \"a singular ideal of beauty\".\nTwo separate petitions urging Unilever to stop the production of its Fair & Lovely range have been signed by more than 18,000 people in recent weeks.\n\"This product has built upon, perpetuated and benefited from internalised racism and promotes anti-blackness sentiments,\" one says.\nA second petition claimed the cream \"tells us that there is something wrong with our color, that we have to be light in order to feel beautiful. In order to feel worthy.\"\nSunny Jain, President of Beauty & Personal Care at Unilever, said: \"We are fully committed to having a global portfolio of skin care brands that is inclusive and cares for all skin tones, celebrating greater diversity of beauty. \n\"We recognise that the use of the words 'fair', 'white' and 'light' suggest a singular ideal of beauty that we don't think is right, and we want to address this.\"\n\"The brand has never been and is not a bleaching product,\" Unilever added.\nThe consumer goods giant also said that it had removed before-and-after impressions and \"shade guides\" on Fair & Lovely packaging in 2019. The skin care range is sold across countries such as India, Indonesia, Thailand and Pakistan.\nUnilever's move comes as cosmetics firms around the world reassess their product lines and marketing strategies in light of the Black Lives Matters movement, sparked by George Floyd's death.\nGeorge Floyd died in Minneapolis in May as a white police officer held a knee on his neck for nearly nine minutes.\nThe final moments were filmed on phones. Four police officers involved have been sacked and charged over his death.\nWriter and activist Poorna Bell said that Unilever's announcement was \"hugely disappointing\".\n\"It doesn't do enough to make reparations for the untold mental and emotional damage done by colourism,\" a prejudice or discrimination against individuals with a dark skin tone, often among people of the same ethnic group.\n\"Renaming the products doesn't mean anything - that's still just colourism by another word,\" she said.\nShe also called for Unilever to match Johnson & Johnson's recent commitment to stop selling certain products that are advertised as dark-spot reducers in Asia and the Middle East, but have been used by consumers to lighten skin tone.\nSkin-lightening products are typically aimed at women in the Black and Asian communities, says Dr Steve Garner, a sociologist, who carried out one of the first British studies into skin-lightening.\nNivea's parent company Beiersdorf told the BBC that it \"stands against racism and discrimination of any kind and supports the Black Lives Matter movement.\"\nNivea's Natural Fairness line is sold in the Middle East, India as well as Nigeria and Ghana.\nOn its Middle East website, the product is described as being able to \"prevent the darkening of skin tone\". \nWhen asked by the BBC if it would amend the description, Nivea said that the product contains SPF-15 \"which helps prevent sun-induced skin damage, such as irregular dark pigmentation, for any skin type.\"\nIt added: \"We are currently doing a review in all our products descriptions and are in the process of re-evaluating and updating the description that may cause any misinterpretation.\"\nL'Oreal did not respond to the BBC's request for comment on its Garnier White Complete range.\nIn a YouTube video advertising the range, cartoon images of women are put side-by-side, claiming that the products can \"brighten\"  the skin.\n\"The language around these products upholds the beauty standards that lighter or whiter skin is more desirable,\" Nomshado Michelle Baca, the founder of beauty brand A Complexion Company.\n\"The individual who formulated and marketed the products is not likely to be a person of colour, resulting in a warped perception that all black women desire lighter skin.\"\nBut she argues that the conversation has become \"hyper-focused on the change of someone's entire complexion. \n\"The woman who wants to treat small areas of scarring is left invisible and without options but to use the damaging products available in unregulated retailers or black hair shops.\"\nUnless they are issued on prescription by a doctor, creams containing hydroquinone, steroids or mercury are banned in the UK - because of their potentially serious side-effects.\nConsumers have previously been warned by the Local Government Association to steer clear of those toxic products that can \"act like paint stripper\".\nBBC News identified products containing the bleaching agent hydroquinone available to UK customers on online marketplace EBay.\nA spokesperson for EBay told the BBC: \"Only items that comply with the law are allowed to be listed on eBay and any products containing hydroquinone, steroids or mercury are banned. \n\"Listings containing these ingredients were immediately removed and we are taking enforcement action against the sellers. We work closely with regulatory authorities including Trading Standards and the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency to keep our community safe.\"\nThey added that EBay has been updating its \"offensive materials policy\" in recent weeks in light of the Black Lives Matter movement.\n\"In the bigger picture, companies should have been doing these things, such as weeding out potentially poisonous products, a long time ago,\" Dr Steve Garner added.\n\"Realistically, these commitments will have very little impact for a global company.\"",

        "description": "Skincare firm Dermalogica has urged the UK to give beauty salons and spas a date for reopening as coronavirus lockdown measures ease.\nHairdressers, pubs and restaurants in England will be allowed to reopen on 4 July with safety measures in place.\nIn an open letter to the government, Dermalogica UK wrote: \"We assure you, we are taking coronavirus seriously.\"\nThe firm said there was \"confusion\" around why beauty salons are not allowed to reopen next month.\nWriting to Business Secretary Alok Sharma, Dermalogica UK's general manager Hermann questioned why \"one-to-one services in a highly sanitised environment\" would put consumers more at risk of contracting the coronavirus, than a restaurant or pub with minimal social distancing measures.\n\"The industry, which has a strong and existing standard on hygiene and sanitation, has been active in preparing to go back to work safely,\" he said.\nDermalogica stocks skincare products and treatments for acne in more than 5,500 spas and beauty salons across the UK.\nSpeaking in the House of Commons on Tuesday, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said that contact services, such as nail bars or spas, would not be able to open until the government could confirm they \"can operate in a coronavirus-secure way\".\nBut beauty and wellness industries argue that they require \"clarity on whether it will be possible to remain in business\", said Mr Hermann.\nIn a survey of the businesses Dermalogica UK works with, 6% have said they will be forced to close as a result of coronavirus-related lockdown measures.\nBeautician Tara Williamson is frustrated by what she sees as a double standard from government, with hairdressers allowed to reopen, but beauty salons staying closed.\nShe runs The Beauty, Skin and Eyelash Lounge in Epping, Essex and had planned to open on 4 July.\n\"It just seems crazy that we have no guidelines of when we can open and what is going to be happening,\" she told the BBC. \n\"I don't see a reason why we couldn't open and it will obviously be a big blow.\"\nThe prime minister said on Tuesday that the government's public health experts will work with sectors which remain closed, to help them open \"as soon as possible\".\nBBC News has contacted the Department for Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy for comment.",

        "description": "The US has threatened new trade tariffs on beer, chocolate and olives from the European Union, as part of a long-running row over subsidies to planemaker Airbus.\nThe US Trade Representative said it was considering duties on 30 products worth $3.1bn (£2.5bn) in trade every year. \nIt has already put 15% to 25% tariffs on $7.5bn worth of other EU goods as part of the dispute.\nThe EU warned it would damage firms on both side of the Atlantic.\nAnd UK Trade Minister Liz Truss said she was disappointed by the move, warning against the use of \"tit-for-tat\" tariffs.\nThe row centres on EU subsidies given to Airbus before 2004, which Washington says created an unfair advantage over the US aircraft manufacturer Boeing.\nLast year, the World Trade Organization (WTO) ruled the subsidies were illegal and allowed the US to levy tariffs on EU goods, including aircraft, wines and cheese.\nBut it is now considering a parallel case involving illegal support for Boeing, which could see the EU imposing duties later this year.\nThe US said pastry and cakes, gin, cashmere clothes and hardware products could all be in the firing line for new tariffs, affecting exporters across the continent.  \nIn a statement the EU said Washington was going beyond what was allowed by the WTO.\n\"It creates uncertainty for companies and inflicts unnecessary economic damage on both sides of the Atlantic,\" it added.\n\"This is particularly the case as companies are now trying to overcome the economic difficulties in the aftermath of the Covid-19 crisis.\"\nSince 2017, the US has been embroiled in a damaging trade war with China, which it accuses of unfair trade practices and intellectual property theft. However, it has also trained it fire on allies including the EU. \nBefore last year's tariffs over Airbus, the Trump administration had imposed duties on EU steel and aluminium - spurring Brussels to tax iconic US products such as denim jeans and motorcycles.\nMr Trump has also threatened duties on European cars, a particular concern to Germany. \nUS-levied tariffs are paid by US businesses, which in turn may pass those costs on to consumers. The Distilled Spirits Council of the United States said its members had been hit hard by the Airbus-Boeing spat.\n\"EU and US distilled spirits companies have suffered enough as a result of this trade war. The longer these disputes go unresolved, the greater the threat of even more tariffs on our industry.\"",

        "description": "Scandal-hit payments firm Wirecard has filed for insolvency, causing its shares to dive almost 80%.\nIt comes after the German firm last week disclosed a €1.9bn (£1.7bn) hole in its accounts.\nFormer boss Markus Braun has since been arrested and accused of inflating Wirecard's finances to make them appear healthier to investors and customers.\nThe firm's creditors stand to lose billions of euros from the scandal.\nThe controversy erupted last week when auditors EY refused to sign off on firm's company's accounts, having been unable to locate the missing €1.9bn.\nThe Munich based firm, which employs almost 6,000 staff in 26 countries, initially claimed the money was held in accounts at two banks in the Philippines.\nBut on Monday Wirecard said the money simply may not exist.\nIn a statement on Thursday, the firm said its new management had decided to apply for insolvency at a Munich court \"due to impending insolvency and over-indebtedness\".\nThe firm is also evaluating whether to file for insolvency proceedings for its subsidiaries.\nWirecard, which was launched as a start-up in 1999, joined Germany's prestigious Dax 30 share index two years ago at a valuation of €24bn. \nBut the company's shares have crashed almost 100% in the last week, giving it a stock market valuation of less than €400m.\nThe Munich prosecutor's office, which is investigating Mr Braun, said it had now widened its investigation to look at others. \nFormer chief operating officer Jan Marsalek is under suspicion and believed to be in the Philippines, according to the Reuters news agency. \nMeanwhile, Mr Braun has been freed on bail of €5m and remains a suspect.

        "title": "Qantas to cut 6,000 jobs due to virus impact",
        "description": "Qantas will axe 6,000 jobs as part of its plans to survive the coronavirus pandemic, the airline says.\nThe cuts equate to about a fifth of the airline's workforce prior to the Covid-19 crisis. In March, it furloughed more than 80% of its staff.\nAustralia's national carrier said the collapse in global air travel had devastated revenues.\nLast week, the Australian government said its border would most likely remain closed into next year.\nIt prompted Qantas to cancel all international flights until late October, except for those to New Zealand.\nOn Thursday, chief executive Alan Joyce said the airline expected smaller revenues in the next three years, forcing it to become a smaller operation to survive.\n\"The actions we must take will have a huge impact on thousands of our people,\" he said in a statement.\n\"But the collapse in billions of dollars in revenue leaves us little choice if we are to save as many jobs as possible, long term.\"\nMr Joyce added that Qantas, and its budget subsidiary Jetstar, would continue to extend a furlough for about 15,000 workers \"as we wait for the recovery we know is coming\".\nAustralia has flattened its virus curve faster than other nations, meaning demand for domestic flights has returned and is expected to fully recover by 2022. \nBut international demand at that time is forecast to be half of what it was, Qantas said.\nThe airline also plans to raise A$1.9bn (£1.05bn; $1.3bn) in equity - its first such move in 10 years - to bring in new funds and help \"accelerate\" its recovery.\nOther short-term savings will be found by grounding up to 100 planes, including its A380 fleet, and deferring the purchase of new planes, it said.\nGreg Waldron, Asia managing editor of FlightGlobal, told the BBC that the measures should help support the airline as it deals with the fallout from the pandemic.\n\"Qantas's mix of job cuts, fleet reductions, and capital raising are designed to reduce costs during a demand crisis for the industry, and retain a solid core for the eventual rebound. In the short to medium term, Australia's strong domestic market should help Qantas's revenue partially revive.\"\nSimon Atkinson, BBC News in Sydney\nAustralia's borders remain pretty much shut in and out - apart from returning citizens or for passengers with exceptional circumstances. And the comments by Qantas today are telling.\nBy grounding most of its international fleet \"for at least the next year\", the airline is clearly not expecting international borders to open up in a meaningful way until at least June 2021.\nShould the much talked-about trans-Tasman bubble between Australia and New Zealand open up, Qantas will doubtless be part of that.\nBut for non-Australians hoping to visit family abroad - or for Aussies eyeing a holiday to Bali - there's no need to pack the passport for a while yet. \nOf course today the biggest thoughts go to the 6,000 or so Qantas staff who are losing their jobs, and the 15,000 employees who remain stood down.\nMr Joyce is hopeful about half of that latter group will be back helping the airline run domestic routes by the end of the year on the back of ramped-up demand to fly around this vast country. That hinges on Australia's states opening borders to allow free travel. \nAnd that depends on Australia keeping Covid-19 well under control - so outbreaks like the one we're seeing right now in Melbourne do not become the norm.\nThe airline said its massive loyalty programme - which has 13 million members or around half Australia's population - would be its best hope of recovery while borders remain closed.\nAustralia's other large carrier, Virgin Australia, slumped into voluntary administration in April and is currently undergoing a sale process.\nThe International Air Transport Association (IATA) - the peak body for airlines - has warned that global airline revenue has seen a 55% decline on 2019 levels. IATA says it will take more than three years for global travel to return to 2019 levels.\nAviation industry analyst Shukor Yusof from Endau Analytics warned that worse is still to come for the world's airlines as they deal with the impact of the coronavirus.\n\"The crisis is deeper and wider than what many think it is, and it will have a debilitating effect on the industry. We are seeing just the beginning of what is going to be at least 12 to 18 months of pain and suffering before airlines slowly recover.\"",

        "description": "Scandal-hit payments firm Wirecard has filed for insolvency, causing its shares to dive almost 80%.\nIt comes after the German firm last week disclosed a €1.9bn (£1.7bn) hole in its accounts.\nFormer boss Markus Braun has since been arrested and accused of inflating Wirecard's finances to make them appear healthier to investors and customers.\nThe firm's creditors stand to lose billions of euros from the scandal.\nThe controversy erupted last week when auditors EY refused to sign off on firm's company's accounts, having been unable to locate the missing €1.9bn.\nThe Munich based firm, which employs almost 6,000 staff in 26 countries, initially claimed the money was held in accounts at two banks in the Philippines.\nBut on Monday Wirecard said the money simply may not exist.\nIn a statement on Thursday, the firm said its new management had decided to apply for insolvency at a Munich court \"due to impending insolvency and over-indebtedness\".\nThe firm is also evaluating whether to file for insolvency proceedings for its subsidiaries.\nWirecard, which was launched as a start-up in 1999, joined Germany's prestigious Dax 30 share index two years ago at a valuation of €24bn. \nBut the company's shares have crashed almost 100% in the last week, giving it a stock market valuation of less than €400m.\nThe Munich prosecutor's office, which is investigating Mr Braun, said it had now widened its investigation to look at others. \nFormer chief operating officer Jan Marsalek is under suspicion and believed to be in the Philippines, according to the Reuters news agency. \nMeanwhile, Mr Braun has been freed on bail of €5m and remains a suspect.

        "title": "Qantas to cut 6,000 jobs due to virus impact",
        "description": "Qantas will axe 6,000 jobs as part of its plans to survive the coronavirus pandemic, the airline says.\nThe cuts equate to about a fifth of the airline's workforce prior to the Covid-19 crisis. In March, it furloughed more than 80% of its staff.\nAustralia's national carrier said the collapse in global air travel had devastated revenues.\nLast week, the Australian government said its border would most likely remain closed into next year.\nIt prompted Qantas to cancel all international flights until late October, except for those to New Zealand.\nOn Thursday, chief executive Alan Joyce said the airline expected smaller revenues in the next three years, forcing it to become a smaller operation to survive.\n\"The actions we must take will have a huge impact on thousands of our people,\" he said in a statement.\n\"But the collapse in billions of dollars in revenue leaves us little choice if we are to save as many jobs as possible, long term.\"\nMr Joyce added that Qantas, and its budget subsidiary Jetstar, would continue to extend a furlough for about 15,000 workers \"as we wait for the recovery we know is coming\".\nAustralia has flattened its virus curve faster than other nations, meaning demand for domestic flights has returned and is expected to fully recover by 2022. \nBut international demand at that time is forecast to be half of what it was, Qantas said.\nThe airline also plans to raise A$1.9bn (£1.05bn; $1.3bn) in equity - its first such move in 10 years - to bring in new funds and help \"accelerate\" its recovery.\nOther short-term savings will be found by grounding up to 100 planes, including its A380 fleet, and deferring the purchase of new planes, it said.\nGreg Waldron, Asia managing editor of FlightGlobal, told the BBC that the measures should help support the airline as it deals with the fallout from the pandemic.\n\"Qantas's mix of job cuts, fleet reductions, and capital raising are designed to reduce costs during a demand crisis for the industry, and retain a solid core for the eventual rebound. In the short to medium term, Australia's strong domestic market should help Qantas's revenue partially revive.\"\nSimon Atkinson, BBC News in Sydney\nAustralia's borders remain pretty much shut in and out - apart from returning citizens or for passengers with exceptional circumstances. And the comments by Qantas today are telling.\nBy grounding most of its international fleet \"for at least the next year\", the airline is clearly not expecting international borders to open up in a meaningful way until at least June 2021.\nShould the much talked-about trans-Tasman bubble between Australia and New Zealand open up, Qantas will doubtless be part of that.\nBut for non-Australians hoping to visit family abroad - or for Aussies eyeing a holiday to Bali - there's no need to pack the passport for a while yet. \nOf course today the biggest thoughts go to the 6,000 or so Qantas staff who are losing their jobs, and the 15,000 employees who remain stood down.\nMr Joyce is hopeful about half of that latter group will be back helping the airline run domestic routes by the end of the year on the back of ramped-up demand to fly around this vast country. That hinges on Australia's states opening borders to allow free travel. \nAnd that depends on Australia keeping Covid-19 well under control - so outbreaks like the one we're seeing right now in Melbourne do not become the norm.\nThe airline said its massive loyalty programme - which has 13 million members or around half Australia's population - would be its best hope of recovery while borders remain closed.\nAustralia's other large carrier, Virgin Australia, slumped into voluntary administration in April and is currently undergoing a sale process.\nThe International Air Transport Association (IATA) - the peak body for airlines - has warned that global airline revenue has seen a 55% decline on 2019 levels. IATA says it will take more than three years for global travel to return to 2019 levels.\nAviation industry analyst Shukor Yusof from Endau Analytics warned that worse is still to come for the world's airlines as they deal with the impact of the coronavirus.\n\"The crisis is deeper and wider than what many think it is, and it will have a debilitating effect on the industry. We are seeing just the beginning of what is going to be at least 12 to 18 months of pain and suffering before airlines slowly recover.\"",

        "title": "US claims Huawei 'backed by Chinese military'",
        "description": "The US Defense Department has determined that 20 top Chinese firms, including Huawei, are either owned by or backed by the Chinese military.\nThe list, seen by US media, features video surveillance firm Hikvision, China Telecoms, China Mobile and AVIC.\nThe determination could lay the groundwork for new US financial sanctions against the firms. \nIt comes as the US has pressured other countries, including the UK, to bar Huawei for national security reasons.\nThe BBC understands that the list has been published in order to inform congressional committees, US businesses, investors and other potential partners of Chinese firms about the role such firms may play in transferring sensitive technology to the Chinese military. The list is also likely to grow. \nUnder US law, the Defense Department is required to track firms \"owned or controlled\" by China's People's Liberation Army that are active in the US.\nThe Pentagon has been under pressure in recent months from lawmakers of both the Democrats and Republican parties to publish and update the list. \nIn November, US senators Tom Cotton and Chuck Schumer wrote a letter to Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross, asking for an update on reviews of US policy that are mandated by the Export Control Reform Act of 2018 and the 2019 National Defense Authorization Act.\nIn the letter, the senators emphasised their concerns about the danger of exporting critical US technologies to companies with Chinese ties.\nThey also questioned why the Commerce Department had been slow to complete export-control reviews mandated by the two acts.\nThe senators stressed that reviews should be conducted to assess whether the Chinese Communist Party had been stealing US technology with military applications, as well as whether it had been enlisting Chinese corporations to harness emerging civilian technologies for military purposes.\n\"What is the status of this review and implementation of the results? Will this review determine specific sectors of the US economy that the Chinese are targeting for espionage and forced technology-transfer efforts? Will you modify the scope of controls for military end uses and end-users in China? Will you make the results of this review public?,\" wrote Mr Cotton and Mr Schumer.\n\"We urge you to conduct these mandatory reviews as quickly and thoroughly as possible. Thank you for your time and attention to this important matter of national security.\"\nThe White House already taken several steps against Huawei and other Chinese firms, including barring US companies from selling them certain technology without permission. The administration has also said its trade war with China, which resulted in billions of dollars worth of tariffs, was a response to theft of US trade secrets.\nBut it has faced calls by some in Washington to act more aggressively.\nHuawei has contested US claims against it as \"unsubstantiated allegations\".",

        "title": "Waitrose boss backs chlorinated chicken ban",
        "description": "The new boss of supermarket Waitrose has backed calls to stop any relaxation of rules banning imports of chlorinated chicken and hormone-injected beef.\nJames Bailey said Waitrose would not stock such products.\nThe message supports a National Farmers Union campaign to ban imports of food produced to a lower standard than currently allowed in the UK.\nTrade Secretary Liz Truss told MPs last week that the UK's food standards will not be compromised by new trade deals.\nShe was responding to concerns among food campaigners and environmental groups that lowering standards for imported produce could form part of a future UK-US trade deal.\nBut fears over chlorine-washed chicken and other US farming practices have been described by Woody Johnson, the US ambassador to the UK, as \"inflammatory and misleading\".\nEarlier this year, Mr Johnson said it was important that US beef and poultry should be allowed into the UK. \nHe said the process was used by EU farmers to treat vegetables, and that it was the best way to deal with salmonella and other bacteria.\nIn Waitrose's Weekend magazine, Mr Bailey pointed out that a million people have signed a National Farmers Union (NFU) petition calling for laws to prevent future trade deals leading to food imports that would be illegal to produce in the UK.\n\"We will never sell any Waitrose product that does not meet our own high standards,\" he said.\nHe said that \"any regression from the standards we have pioneered for the last 30 years would be an unacceptable backwards step\".\nHe added: \"It would be simply wrong to maintain high standards at home yet import food from overseas that has been produced to lower standards.\n\"We would be closing our eyes to a problem that exists in another part of the world and to animals who are out of our sight and our minds.\"\nWashing chicken in chlorine and other disinfectants to remove harmful bacteria was a practice banned by the European Union (EU) in 1997 over food safety concerns. \nIt's not consuming chlorine itself that the EU is worried about - in fact in 2005 the European Food Safety Authority said that \"exposure to chlorite residues arising from treated poultry carcasses would be of no safety concern\". \nChlorine-rinsed bagged salads are common in the UK and other countries in the EU.  \nBut the EU believes that relying on a chlorine rinse at the end of the meat production process could be a way of compensating for poor hygiene standards - such as dirty or crowded abattoirs.  \nInstead, the EU says the best way to eliminate the risk of salmonella and other bacteria is to maintain high farming and production standards. \nThe majority of British consumers are against imports of lower standard food, according to a Which? survey published on Thursday.\nSome 95% of consumers said it is important for the UK to maintain existing food standards, which ban the use of chlorine-washing, growth hormones and many pesticides.\nMeanwhile 86% fear a weakening of standards could lead to the import of products banned in the UK.\nWhich? warned that could lead to chlorinated chicken and hormone-treated beef being served up in schools, hospitals and restaurants, where people may have little information or choice about what they eat.\nSue Davies, head of consumer protection and food policy at Which?, said: \"Food standards in the UK must not be compromised by any trade deal that would betray decades of progress on food safety, quality and animal welfare.\"\nA Department for International Trade spokesman said: \"This government has been clear it will not sign a trade deal that will compromise our high environmental protection, animal welfare and food safety standards.\n\"Chlorinated chicken and hormone-injected beef are not permitted for import into the UK. This will be retained through the EU Withdrawal Act and enshrined in UK law at the end of the transition agreement.\"",

        "description": "Royal Mail is to cut 2,000 management jobs as it struggles to deal with the effects of the coronavirus crisis.\nThe cuts, about a fifth of the company's management roles, aim to save about £130m in costs from next year.\nRoyal Mail said the pandemic accelerated the trend of more parcels and fewer letters being sent, and it had not adapted quickly enough to that.\nThe company's challenges have included former boss Rico Back making a surprise exit from the business in May.\nThe job losses will hit senior roles hardest, with half of them set to go, and will mainly fall on so-called \"back-office\" jobs, including finance, commercial and IT.\nFrontline postal staff are unlikely to be affected because Royal Mail needs to preserve \"quality of service\", a spokesman said.\nRoyal Mail's cull of middle managers - one fifth of the near-10,000 total - is a warm-up for a much tougher set of negotiations with front line staff.\nThe company has had a fractious relationship with its workforce and the Communication Workers' Union for several years, and its attempts to change terms and conditions, including pension arrangements, have been fraught with difficulty.\nChairman Keith Williams, who is standing in as chief executive after the abrupt departure of Rico Back last month, is blunt about the need for change, saying the company had \"not adapted quickly enough to the changes in our marketplace of more parcels and fewer letters\". \nThat succinct diagnosis could have been written at any point in the last decade, and it is perhaps slightly surprising that, after more than a decade of organisational reshuffles, the company still has 10,000 people in management roles.\nThe job cuts are still subject to consultation. The bigger battle, with the CWU, still awaits.\nThe Unite union, which represents the Royal Mail managers, said the move to cut jobs \"deflects attention from where the real problems lie\".\n\"Poor decision-making at the top of Royal Mail in the past has failed to recognise the pace in the decline in the volume of letters, and there has been a too slow investment in technology and facilities to keep abreast of the huge growth in parcels,\" said Unite national lead officer for the Royal Mail group Mike Eatwell.\n\"This scenario has been made worse by the adverse impact of coronavirus on the economy.\" \nHe said the job cuts were \"a classic example of trying to reposition a business to create a viable long-term future, while feeling under pressure to make short-term cuts that only hinder that transition\".\nRoyal Mail said that the planned job cuts, which it wants to make by March 2021, would save £130m on \"people costs\".\nThe company did not pay a dividend to shareholders in 2020, and said in a statement to investors on Thursday that it would not pay a dividend in 2021 either. Royal Mail shares fell almost 9% in morning trading.\nIn the year to March 2020 the company made a profit before tax of £180m, down from £241m the year before.\nRoyal Mail has been trying to move away from its UK-focused letters business to be an internationally-focused parcels business, said Richard Hunter, head of markets at Interactive Investor.\nThe coronavirus crisis has caused job losses in a number of industries in the UK so far.\nThe aviation industry has been hit particularly hard. On Wednesday, airport ground handling giant Swissport announced it would halve its UK workforce.\nBritish Airways said in April that it would cut up to 12,000 jobs, drawing criticism from MPs.",

        "description": "Chemical firm Bayer is to pay up to $10.9bn (£8.8bn) to settle cancer claims linked to its Roundup weedkiller.\nThe glyphosate-based product has been subject to about 125,000 lawsuits over its allegedly carcinogenic effects.\nNew York-based law firm Weitz & Luxenberg says it has reached a settlement on behalf of almost 100,000 people.\nBayer denies any wrongdoing but said the payout would end \"uncertainty\".\nRoundup was originally launched by US firm Monsanto, which was bought by Bayer in 2018.\nSince its introduction more than four decades ago, it has become known as the world's most popular weedkiller,\nAs part of the settlement, Bayer will pay as much as $9.6bn to resolve outstanding claims, and set aside a further $1.25bn to deal with any future action, the company said in a statement on its website.\n\"It has been a long journey, but we are very pleased that we've achieved justice for the tens of thousands of people who, through no fault of their own, are suffering from Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma after using a product Monsanto assured them was safe,\" Robin Greenwald, Practice Group Chair, Environmental Pollution and Consumer Protection at Weitz & Luxenberg, said in a statement.\nUp to $5bn of the agreed payout will be released this year, with a further $5bn paid in 2021. Bayer said an agreement had not yet been reached for about 25% of the outstanding claims.\n\"First and foremost, the Roundup settlement is the right action at the right time for Bayer to bring a long period of uncertainty to an end,\" wrote Werner Baumann, chief executive of Bayer.\nHe repeated the company's view that the science indicates \"Roundup does not cause cancer, and therefore, is not responsible for the illnesses alleged in this litigation\".\nThe German chemical giant bought Monsanto for $63bn two years ago and immediately faced legal battles over the herbicide. \nIn August 2018, a California court issued the first ruling linking Roundup to cancer, awarding claimants substantial compensation.\nIn their lawsuits, users blame Roundup and its active ingredient glyphosate for their non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and other cancers. \nGlyphosate is the active ingredient in many weedkillers, although the science about its safety is still far from conclusive. Some countries have banned herbicides that contain glyphosate while others continue to use them.\nBayer denies glyphosate is a carcinogen, a position backed by the US Environmental Protection Agency.\nIn addition to the Roundup compensation, Bayer will also pay about $820m to settle cases related to water pollution from the use of the now-banned toxic chemical compound polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB).\nOn top of this, another $400m will be paid by Bayer to settle allegations that its dicamba-based herbicide caused damage to crops. Dicamba has also now been banned in America.",

        "title": "Coronavirus: How Africa's supply chains are evolving",
        "description": "The coronavirus lockdown measures imposed by governments around the world have caused severe disruption to supply chains, as companies were forced to shut in March.\nOne sector that has been deeply impacted by the pandemic is the flower industry in East and Southern Africa, which is one of the biggest exporters of cut flowers in the world.\nPrior to the pandemic, the global cut flower market was worth $13bn (£10.4bn) per annum, according to international flower trade association Union Fleurs. \nThe European Union and the US are the biggest buyers of cut flowers in the world, Union Fleurs says. Kenya is Africa's largest flower exporter, with South Africa not far behind.\nMultiflora in Johannesburg is one of South Africa's busiest cut flower auction houses. Prior to the pandemic, the auction house had an annual turnover of $16m. But right now, the auction house is getting 40% of the revenue it previously had. \nDelayed and cancelled flights, increased freight costs and a huge fall in demand have brought the flower trade to a virtual standstill, and some flower farms in Kenya have already gone out of business since lockdown began.\nAll in all, the flower industry in Africa estimates that it has so far had to throw away 241,000 stems as a result of the pandemic. \n\"If there's no socialising, there's no need for flowers. We're effectively looking at two months of non-trading,\" Ian Ross, managing director of Flora Export SA tells the BBC.\nHowever, many more businesses across the African continent have a focus on importing rather than exporting, flying in goods from China and India and reselling them at a higher price.\nLatest data from British property consultancy and estate agency Knight Frank shows that transport costs represent between 50-75% of the retail price of goods sold in Africa. \n\"People want to get rich quickly, so the fastest way is to import goods and charge a high markup - many successful people have done this,\" explains Alex Demissie, managing director of Africa Rising, a business consultancy based in Cologne that advises international companies on entering African markets.\n\"They do have pride for their countries [and homegrown products], but if there's a lot of hassle, people will always use the easiest way to make money.\"\nThe pandemic has unfortunately disrupted this business model, and it has opened the eyes of African entrepreneurs to the reality that local manufacturing needs to become a priority. \n\"Supply chains have become longer and more complicated, and hence more vulnerable,\" says Andrew Alli, chief executive of Southbridge, a pan-African consulting advisory and financial services firm.\nFor example, rubber might be produced in Africa, but it is then exported to China to make personal protective equipment (PPE) like masks, which are then shipped to Europe, he explains, rather than African firms just making the masks themselves for sale. \nBut this is changing now - Africa Rising has seen a new trend of businesses trying to import more machines into African nations to set up local production centres, instead of importing finished products.\n\"This is a very positive development for small and mid-sized companies - international firms who are investing in African countries are actively looking for local components that they can use in their factories on site,\" says Mr Demissie.\n\"We see a trend of diasporas returning to their countries to produce goods for these big international companies, such as making zippers for clothing firms.\n\"Supply chains are moving closer to these factories. At the end of the day, this is what will be creating jobs and making things more successful in the future.\"\nThe other reason African entrepreneurs have historically depended on imports from China and India is that even if you can find someone to make the goods you want to sell in the region, current cross-border supply chains still leave much to be desired.\nIt is too expensive to import goods from neighbouring nations, says Mr Demissie, so smaller firms simply don't bother.\nSouth Africa, Morocco and Egypt have sophisticated supply chains similar to those of developed countries, but the rest of the continent is still trailing far behind, due to weak infrastructure.\n\"It takes too long at customs to bring in the goods. Some of these nations are facing similar obstacles to Southeast Asian countries and China at the beginning of the 1980s,\" says Mr Demissie.\nBut efforts are being made gradually to improve transport networks in some nations.\nInvestments made by Chinese firms in Ethiopia and Kenya over the last three years have greatly improved rail connectivity, making it much easier to import and export goods, and the establishment of special economic zones in Ethiopia, Ghana and Nigeria are helping these countries to start local production centres. \nMr Demissie says that coronavirus lockdown has \"accelerated\" a change in mindset amongst African entrepreneurs, and firms are already coming up with unique \"indigenous\" ways to solve Africa's supply chain problems, like Ethiopian Airlines or Kenya Airways.\nEthiopian Airlines is currently Africa's largest air passenger carrier. Started in 1945, the state-owned airline flies to 100 international destinations, as well as 21 domestic routes across the continent, and it also has an air freight service. \nEthiopian Airlines boss Tewolde GebreMariam told the BBC recently that he does not expect the government to bail the airline out, and to that end the airline has decided to focus on providing even more freight cargo deliveries, both internationally and across the continent, delivering everything from fresh produce to medications and PPE.\n\"It is a very tough challenge but we think we can survive with our cargo business,\" he says.\nKenya Airways is also now considering wide-bodied passenger carriers to bolster its cargo shipments, converting four of its wide-bodied aircrafts into cargo freight aeroplanes.\nOn the day the BBC visited, Kenya Airways ground staff were loading 40 tonnes of fresh-cut flowers and fruits and vegetables into a Boeing 787 Dreamliner destined for London, with the cargo placed on top of seats.\nNigerian motorcycle transit app-based platform startup Max, which already operates in 10 West African cities, is a solution unique to the continent that has also ended up benefiting from the coronavirus lockdown.\n\"One of the outcomes of the pandemic is that with people stuck at home and not able to move around, they've had to find ways to get their essentials delivered to their doorsteps, which has been beneficial to us and has driven the growth of our logistics and last-mile delivery services,\" says Max Nigeria's chief financial officer Betrand Njoya.\n\"We expect that we'll be in a position to grow the size of our network to more than 5,000 drivers within the next 12-18 months.\"\nSupply chains in many African nations are still not very good, and the African Development Bank (ADB) estimates that the continent would need $90-$130bn of investment in infrastructure per annum in order to get the region to where it needs to be. \nThat is a tough figure to get to, but Mr Demissie says that Chinese, Indian, South Korean, Singaporean, Iranian and Russian companies are now pouring some money into improving infrastructure across the continent.\n\"Africa still has the youngest population of any continent - who is going to make and sell consumer goods for the African consumers coming up?,\" he tells the BBC.\n\"China was very backwards at the end of the 1970s, but people were willing to go and invest because they could see the opportunity, and we're seeing that in African nations now.\"",

        "title": "'We went from 30 customers to one in 18 hours'",
        "description": "Liam and Louise Parkinson's cleaning business was just a few weeks old when the coronavirus outbreak forced them to stop working. \nThe husband-and-wife team based in Chippenham, Wiltshire, launched their company Abode and Beyond in January and soon began hiring extra staff to meet the demand from new clients.\nBut then - as news of the coronavirus spread - business quickly dropped away. \n\"Within 18 hours we'd gone from 30 customers down to one or two,\" Liam says. \nWhen the country went into lockdown on 23 March, Liam and Louise had to tell their clients they were suspending all services.\nIn early June, the couple began working again, but only a quarter of their previous clients have booked home cleaning.  \n\"Lots of people say now they can't afford to have a cleaner because they're struggling financially,\" Liam says.\nOther customers have told them cleaning would be too much of a disruption while they're working and educating children from home. And some clients are shielding or worried about the risk of catching Covid-19 from workers coming into their home. \nThose concerns mean cleaners all over the country are facing huge financial challenges, especially as those who work cash-in-hand aren't eligible for government support. \nMartyna, not her real name, works part-time as a domestic cleaner to supplement her main job as a housekeeper at a London hotel. \nShe's been furloughed - or put on state-paid leave - by the hotel but is struggling to get by without the added income cleaning would normally provide.\n\"For more than two months, I didn't do any cleaning work,\" she says. Now she's waiting for her clients to call. \"It's boring and also I need the extra money. The [furlough] money is only for the rent and food. It's nothing.\"\nCleaning staff are permitted to work in people's homes, but industry leaders say there hasn't been clear guidance from the government advising cleaners how to keep themselves and their clients safe. \n\"There's nothing that we can adhere to, we've just got to decide for ourselves what's appropriate, it's a huge worry,\" says Stephen Munton, director of the trade body the Domestic Cleaning Alliance.\n\"We're reliant now on people telling us what they want us to do in their home, what they want us to wear. Should we be taking equipment in, because we don't know whether we should be using what's in the house?\"\nThe British Cleaning Council (BCC), which represents 20 trade groups across the cleaning industry, has written to the Small Business Minister Paul Scully, asking for a meeting to clarify some of those issues, but no such meeting has been arranged. \nThe BCC says that's left cleaning businesses to come up with safety protocols for themselves. \nA spokeswoman for the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy pointed to the government's general coronavirus guidelines for all people who work in private homes.\n\"We have worked closely with businesses, unions and medical experts to develop practical guidelines specifically for those working in other people's homes. These are aimed at making workplaces as safe as possible and giving staff confidence to return to work,\" she said. \n\"We regularly review the science behind the guidance and will continue to work closely with a wide range of stakeholders, including the British Cleaning Council, as we continue to reopen the economy.\"\nChris Wootton runs the domestic cleaning business Poppies, which has 22 franchises across England and usually provides 6,000 cleaning services a month.  \nAll 450 Poppies staff have been furloughed during the lockdown, but now each of the franchises is back up and running.\n\"In simple terms, we've assumed that any of our clients or our staff may be pre-Covid or asymptomatic,\" he says. \"So we've protected one another by practising social distancing, providing gloves, shoe covers, masks and aprons for all our staff.\"\nChris has also introduced new protocols for when cleaning staff arrive at their clients' homes. \nStaff cannot hug or shake hands with their clients. They have also been instructed to wear a mask on arrival, then take two steps back after knocking on the door. \"We do our best to smile with our eyes. That very moment gives our clients confidence,\" he says. \nChris, who also manages his own Poppies franchise, says older clients make up about a third of the domestic cleaning market. \nBarbara and Jim Jackson are in their 80s and are self-isolating because of the virus. They're among those who have put their regular cleaning service on hold. \n\"When we feel it's safe to have people come into the house, we will go back to a cleaner because they've been wonderful for us over the years,\" says Barbara. \"At the moment we have to share the chores between us.\" \nOnce the coronavirus is no longer a risk, Chris Wootton is optimistic he'll see an upturn in elderly customers. \n\"I think they will be a growth area for us because those people will want to stay longer in their own home and not go into a care home,\" he says. \nMeanwhile, back in Chippenham, Liam and Louise Parkinson are hoping more clients will soon start booking their cleaning service again. \nThe couple have been living off their savings since March, since they chose not to apply for government support. \n\"We were a new company and we were really unsure whether we would qualify. We didn't think 10 weeks later we would still not be working,\" says Liam.\n\"We have had literally zero income from that day so it has been really tough. We're between £5,000-£7,000 out of pocket in lost company earnings. It's pretty worrying. It's wiped out all of our personal savings.\"",

        "title": "Creating an online course 'changed my life'",
        "description": "Like many others, interior stylist Lucy Gough saw her income disappear when the coronavirus hit and naturally felt anxious about her future prospects.\n\"Within one week the four shoots I'd been prepping for were all cancelled,\" she recalls.\nHowever, rather than do nothing, London-based Ms Gough decided to pivot her business and create an online interior styling course after teaching a similar course at London design school Central Saint Martins.\n\"Even though I'd wanted to create a course for the last year it wasn't until lockdown was confirmed and all my income evaporated that I started creating it,\" she says.\nCovering six modules including shoot styling and home staging, Ms Gough launched the self-paced course in mid-May and within two weeks had already attracted 112 students from as far as Canada and Poland. She estimates that the course might make her £20,000 this year.\n\"It has changed my life in terms of giving me an income when all my jobs as a stylist were cancelled at the beginning of Covid-19,\" she says. \"I always envisaged my online course being a career sideline but at the moment it's my only focus. When shoots are scheduled in again it will start to become the passive income that I had imagined.\"\nMs Gough is just one of thousands of people worldwide to have created an online course following the outbreak of coronavirus. Thanks to the pandemic, e-learning platforms are experiencing an unprecedented demand as lockdown has prompted people to take courses on everything from digital marketing and life coaching, to floristry and gaming.\nEven before the coronavirus crisis, the value of the sector was forecast to jump to $300bn (£250bn) by 2025, up from $190bn in 2018, according to the research firm Global Market Insights.\nAnkur Nagpal, founder and chief executive of New York-based course-hosting platform Teachable, says lockdown has greatly accelerated the number of people starting an e-learning business.\n\"A lot of people who intended to move their courses online in the future found this to be a catalyst and adapted rapidly,\" he says.\nTotal revenue earned by course tutors on its platform has also grown significantly since the outbreak, with its teachers set to earn more than $43m in May, up from $24m in February.\nEven Mr Nagpal was surprised to see the surge in new course sales. \"I imagined there would be some form of consumer spending slowdown, but we saw the opposite.\"\nGreg Smith, founder of Vancouver-based Thinkific, which provides the software for entrepreneurs looking to create online courses, says, \"Consumption has gone up as people are stuck at home and want to learn new professional skills or take up new hobbies to entertain themselves.\"\nThe company is seeing demand for courses in areas such as mental health, home school activities for kids, and health and fitness.  \nHowever, it is not all rosy in the world of online courses.\nJonathan Little, 26, a content outreach executive living in Crewe, enrolled in a 14-day free trial of a graphic design course via Shaw Academy, an online learning platform, in May in a bid to improve his skillset.\nHowever, not happy with the course, he decided to cancel within the two-week period. He says the process was \"incredibly convoluted and damn-near impossible to cancel\".\n\"You have to log into your account and then you go through five to six different screens, each one giving you the same spiel about 'don't give in on dreams'. \n\"After all these pages you finally get through to what you think is the cancellation page then you're told you can't cancel online and instead need to call. I rang from a landline and after a lengthy automated voicemail, I cancelled. After seeing reviews online I decided to call my bank to make sure no money would go out to them.\"\nMore Technology of Business\nMr Little says it has made him think twice about signing up to online courses in the future. \"It's made me a bit more cautious. I always usually look at reviews online but I just did it in the spur of the moment. It's made me cautious about signing up to things I've not heard of before.\"\nJames Egan, chief executive of Shaw Academy, told the BBC that Mr Little encountered an automated voicemail service because he called on a Sunday, when the firm does not have people answering the phones.\n\"We apologise that the customer's cancellation process took longer than usual. We take customer feedback and satisfaction very seriously and are currently reviewing our cancellation process to see whether we can make it easier for the small number of people who choose to cancel our services.\"\nHow do other sites handle complaints about courses? Thinkific's Greg Smith says, \"If someone alerts us to a scam or fraud we will shut down sites. However, we have done that very little since we set up eight years ago.\"\nAmanda Rosewarne, co-founder and chief executive of the CPD Standards Office, which provides independent Continuing Professional Development (CPD) accreditation, says people should be cautious when taking up courses due to an increasing number of scams.\n\"One scam involves creating a site, charging you for a course, and then never delivering the product,\" she says. \"Scammers can also easily hook you by selling a course, but then once you have completed it and 'passed' the assessment, the professional certificate or licence fails to materialise in the post or by email.\"\nDespite some problems in the sector, for some, running an online course can be life-changing.\nLeila Gharani, 42, has been teaching Excel courses costing via Udemy since 2016 and takes home a six-figure salary from the e-learning platform. The lockdown has led to three times as many students as usual taking up her courses, with 10,400 bookings in April.\nThe Vienna-based course creator says teaching online has changed her \"whole life\". \nShe adds: \"I stopped consulting and I switched all my work to online except for some conferences and speaking engagements. My husband left his full-time work and joined my company. We have a lot more time for the kids and it's offered more stability in our private life as we can work from home.\"\nFor those who never want to go back to an office, online courses might be the future.",

        "title": "What Trump wants from trade",
        "description": "President Donald Trump's approach to international trade is driven to a large extent by his belief that the United States is being unfairly treated by other countries.\nHis main supporting evidence is the trade deficit - the US buys more than it sells internationally. \nHe has referred to the deficit as losing money. In one tweet he wrote about losing $500bn (£388bn) a year as a result of crazy trade with China. No more, he promised.  \nWe have lost 500 Billion Dollars a year, for many years, on Crazy Trade with China. NO MORE!\nEnd of Twitter post  by @realDonaldTrump\nOne of his central economic objectives has been to reduce it. In November 2017, his first year in office, he referred to the total deficit with all trade partners of almost $800bn a year as unacceptable. He said: \"We are going to start whittling that down, and as fast as possible\". \nRivals is a season of in-depth coverage on BBC News about the contest for supremacy between the US and China across trade, tech, defence and soft power.\nRead more here.\nBut it hasn't come down. The figure that President Trump referred to was for trade in goods alone. It has increased in both of the full years since he took office. \nIt was $750bn in the final year under President Barack Obama, $887bn in 2018, and the increase has continued. We have figures for the first nine months of this year, showing the deficit was larger, though only slightly, than in the same period of 2018. \nMr Trump focuses on bilateral deficits, often suggesting they are evidence of the unfair actions of the other country concerned.\nThe deficit with China is by far the largest. It rose in Mr Trump's first two years, but for the first nine months of 2019 it is lower. Both imports and exports have fallen, imports by more. \nThat is hardly surprising as the two countries have applied increased tariffs to large swathes of one another's goods. \nSo a success for President Trump?  Only if you think bilateral trade balances really matter. And most economists think they don't. \nGetting one bilateral deficit down does not guarantee you reduce the overall deficit. The deficit with China may be down, but others have increased - Vietnam, Mexico and Taiwan for example. \nMore from the BBC's series taking an international perspective on trade:\nPart of the underlying story is the fact that the trade balance with the rest of the world is mainly driven not by barriers that countries put in the way of one another's goods.\nInstead, it's about whether countries buy more goods and services than they produce. Prof Greg Mankiw of Harvard University (who used to be a supporter of the Republican Party) puts it like this: \"If you really want to reduce a trade deficit, the way to do it is to bring down spending relative to production, not to demonise trading partners around the world.\"\nPresident Trump has, if anything, done just the opposite. His tax cuts have given a boost to the US economy, though that may now be fading. But it's not really surprising that the trade deficit should rise as Americans - families and businesses - have had more to spend, and some of that money goes on imported goods. \nThere is an idea in economics known as the \"twin deficits hypothesis\", that there is a link between a government budget deficit and a trade deficit - or strictly speaking, a current account deficit that includes some financial transactions in addition to trade in goods and services. \nIt is by no means a settled debate, but the idea that tax cuts can in some circumstances lead to a larger trade deficit is entirely credible.  \nSo there is a coherent story here that President Trump has taken steps - tax cuts - that make it harder to achieve something else he wants - a reduction in the trade deficit.  \nThat's not to say that President Trump isn't on to something, in the sense that his views on trade may reflect real economic damage in some communities. The Nobel Prize winner Esther Duflo says there is among economists an \"instinctive view on trade, that it should be good for everyone\". But it's not true she says.\nAlthough trade boosts growth overall, it does produce concentrated pockets of job losses, she says. That's not a new view, and it doesn't mean you can turn the clock back or reverse the losses by putting up new trade barriers. ",

        "title": "Huawei: Boom time in China",
        "description": "Jun Yu can't resist gadgets.\nMore than 20 smartphones, old tablets and other devices lurk in a corner of his Beijing home - an ever-growing tech junkyard.\nHis apartment also boasts a Google Home smart assistant and an Amazon Echo.\n\"I take three phones out with me every day. I use a phone for Chinese apps, I use my iPhone for Gmail and western apps, and I use my Google Pixel phone for work,\" says the 34-year-old tech entrepreneur.  \nHis obsession has paid off though. In 2009, he bought the first phone to use Android, the software that now runs more than 80% of smartphones.\nA year later, the physics graduate, founded his own company creating content for Chinese Android users. By 2016 he had sold the company for an undisclosed amount to Alibaba, the Chinese e-commerce giant.\nNow he is excited about the next generation of technology, known as 5G. It promises lightning fast internet connections for your mobile phone - fast enough to download movies in a matter of seconds, or to stream high definition TV.\nIn October, Jun Yu pre-ordered a 5G-ready smartphone, made by China's Xiaomi.\n\"4G has enabled many things like mobile video, more immersive gaming. I know 5G will too. But I don't exactly know how yet,\" he says.\nBut in the US and UK the rollout of 5G networks has been hampered by an international row over one of the most important suppliers of 5G equipment, China's Huawei.\nRivals is a season of in-depth coverage on BBC News about the contest for supremacy between the US and China across trade, tech, defence and soft power.\nRead more here.\nThe US has banned the use of Huawei equipment in 5G networks over security fears, and has encouraged its allies to do the same. It also maintains a tight control over what US companies can sell to Huawei, which has disrupted sales of Huawei phones overseas.\nIndustry analysts like Edison Lee, an analyst from financial services group Jefferies, see the US pressure on Huawei as an attempt to break China's potential dominance of the global 5G market. \n\"The tech war is based on America's argument that China's technological advances have been built upon stolen intellectual property rights, and heavy government subsidies, and their belief that Chinese telecom equipment is not safe, and is a national security threat to the US and its allies,\" he says. \n\"As Huawei and [fellow Chinese firm] ZTE increasingly dominate the global telecom equipment market, the western world will be more vulnerable to Chinese spying,\" Lee adds.\nHuawei has always strongly denied that its technology can be used for spying.\nWhile western nations worry about one of the key suppliers of 5G technology, China is racing ahead with its 5G rollout.\nOn 31 October Chinese telecom companies launched 5G services in more than 50 Chinese cities, creating one of the world's largest 5G networks.\nHuawei has built an estimated 50% of the network.\nThe Chinese Ministry of Information claims that in just 20 days the country registered more than 800,000 subscribers. Analysts predict China will have as many as 110 million 5G users by 2020.\nAnd China's tech sector is busy coming up with uses for the new tech.\nOn a large plot of land in northern Hong Kong, researchers are developing 5G powered autonomous vehicles.\nResearchers at Hong Kong Applied Science and Technology Research Institution are working in partnership with China Mobile, the largest telecom company in China. \nThey see 5G as being particularly useful for self-driving cars, allowing the cars to build an accurate picture of what's going on around them, by communicating with other vehicles, traffic signals and sensors in the road.\n\"For consumers, 5G will possibly transform how we interact with other. For the government, 5G will transform roads and road infrastructure to enable new applications like enhanced assisted-driving and eventually autonomous driving,\" says Alex Mui, a researcher on the project. \nChina is not the first country to roll out 5G. But it is building one of the world's biggest 5G markets very quickly.\nWhile Huawei and ZTE are doing well from that expansion, they would still like to break into lucrative overseas markets like the US. \nSpeaking at a 5G convention in Beijing in November, China's minister for industry and information accused America of using cybersecurity as an excuse for protectionism. \n\"No country should ban a company in its 5G network rollout by using the unproved allegations of cybersecurity risks,\" said Miao Wei.\nMore Technology of Business\nIndustry analysts are not confident that the row between China and the US will be sorted out anytime soon.\n\"We see the current tensions as a technological Cold War, as tech nationalism intensifies,\" says Ben Wood, chief of research, at CCS Insight.\n\"With the Chinese government firmly committed to establishing China as a world-leading 5G nation, the opportunity for Huawei in its home market is immense.\n\"However, the rest of the world can't afford to get left behind, and without access to Huawei infrastructure US mobile network operators in particular will need to rely on alternative suppliers who may be more expensive and less advanced with 5G.\"",

        "title": "How China plans to lead in computer chips",
        "description": "On a university campus on the outskirts of Hong Kong a group of engineers are designing computer chips they hope will be used in the next generation of Chinese made smart phones.\nPatrick Yue leans back in his chair in a coffee shop on the campus, sporting a Stanford University t-shirt. He is the lead engineer and professor overseeing the project.\nHis research team designs optical communication chips, which use light rather than electrical signals to transfer information, and are needed in 5G mobile phones and other internet-connected devices.\nHe tells me about the challenges China faces in developing a world-beating computer chip industry.\n\"I actually think the actual designers will be as big a bottle neck as the manufacturing. We don't have nearly as many research institutes and industry bases to train the designers,\" he says.\nHis department is part-funded by Huawei, the Chinese communications and telecom giant at the centre of an international political storm. \nIn May the US added Huawei to a list of companies that US firms cannot trade with unless they have a licence, blaming security concerns.\nRivals is a season of in-depth coverage on BBC News about the contest for supremacy between the US and China across trade, tech, defence and soft power.\nRead more here.\nMany industry observers fear that the US-Chinese trade war, risks unravelling the global technology supply chain.\nIn particular, China relies on overseas companies for computer chips (or semiconductors), the tiny devices used in everything from consumer electronics to military hardware. \n\"Politically everything can be used as a bargaining power,\" says Mr Yue.\n\"If these companies and countries start to hold back on technology then everyone will get hurt. It's not good from a technological point of view,\" Mr Yue says.\nChina has made no secret of its desire to become self-sufficient in technology. The nation is both the world's largest importer and consumer of semiconductors.\nIt currently produces just 16% of the semiconductors fuelling its tech boom. \nBut it has plans to produce 40% of all semiconductors it uses by 2020, and 70% by 2025, an ambitious plan spurred by the trade war with the US.\nIn May 2018 China's President Xi Jinping met with the country's leading scientists and engineers, calling for specialists to work towards self-reliance in the production of core technologies.\nThat meeting was just a month after the US government banned US firms from selling components to ZTE, China's second-largest maker of telecom network equipment.\nThe ban highlighted to China's leaders that the nation's tech boom was dependent on foreign technology. \nIn October this year, in its latest bid to help wean the nation's tech sector away from US technology, the Chinese government created a $29bn (£22bn) fund to support the semiconductor industry.\n\"There is no question that China has the engineers to make chips. The question is whether they can make competitive ones,\" questions Piero Scaruffi, a Silicon Valley historian, and artificial intelligence researcher who works in Silicon Valley.\nMore Technology of Business\n\"Certainly, Huawei can develop its own chips and operating systems, and the government can make sure that they will be successful in China. But Huawei and other Chinese phone makers are successful also in foreign markets, and that's a totally different question: Will Huawei's chips and operating systems be as competitive as Qualcomm's and Android? Most likely not. At best, it will take years before they are,\" Mr Scaruffi adds.\nMr Scaruffi estimates that China could be as many as 10 years behind the leading producers of high-end computer chips. The majority of chips made for high-end electronics are manufactured by specialist foundries like the Taiwanese Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC). It produces more than 70% of chips designed by third party companies. \nJust securing the best machinery needed to make high-end chips is difficult.\n\"To start out with equipment, its very high precision equipment. You need to print very fine features.  The equipment that is needed to have this kind of technology is controlled by a few companies in the world,\" says Mr Yue. \nHe believes that Chinese technology is three to four generations behind companies like TSMC. China lacks the industry experience to manufacture high end chips, he says. But he believes that companies like Huawei are already competitive when it comes to designing chips.\nWhere does this leave the tech giant Huawei?\nMr Yue argues that Huawei is trying to replicate the successful business models of firms like Samsung, which produces its own computer chips - rather than trying to fall into line with Beijing's industrial ambitions.\n\"You can almost view them as an integrated company with the expertise of what Apple or Qualcomm has,\" says Mr Yue.\nLi Changzhu is a lifelong employee of Huawei and president of the company's handset business. He joined the company 23 years ago as a fresh graduate and has watched it grow into the international tech giant. He claims that the goal of companies like Huawei is simply to satisfy consumer needs. \n\"We are open to use other vendors chipsets. Every year we purchase a lot of chips from Qualcomm. We are open to that. We use the best chipsets to satisfy our customers,\" he says sitting on the side of a tech conference in Macau, a semi- autonomous southern Chinese city.\nGrowth in the semiconductor industry is typically driven by disruptive new technologies. In the late 2000s the introduction of smartphones boosted demand for the tiny integrated circuits that control everything from memory to Bluetooth and wifi.\nBut today China's ambition to dominate sectors such as artificial intelligence and 5G is expected to further ramp up demand for high-end chips.\nIndustry analysts like Mr Scaruffi question China's ability to truly innovate. \"Every Chinese city wants to build its own Silicon Valley. It tends to be more driven from the top. Silicon Valley had a big advantage, that it was very far away from the political power,\" says Mr Scaruffi. \nHe believes that China's technological success lies in the implementation of technology rather than its creation.\n\"If your metric is how many people use smart phones to go shopping then China wins big time. But if your metric is Nobel Prize winners, then China is losing badly. China of course has been very successful in implementing technology in a way that dramatically alters society,\" he says. ",

        "title": "Is China gaining an edge in AI?",
        "description": "\"China is betting on AI and investing in AI and deploying AI on a scale no other country is doing,\" says Abishur Prakash, a futurist and author of books about the effect of artificial intelligence (AI) on geopolitics.\nAs developments in AI accelerate, some in the US fear that the ability of China's powerful central government to marshal data and pour resources into the field will push it ahead. \nThe country has announced billions in funding for start-ups, launched programmes to woo researchers from overseas and streamlined its data policies. \nIt has announced news-reading robots and AI-powered strategy for foreign relations. Perhaps most alarming to the US are its efforts to incorporate it into its military.\nIn the last few years, Washington has toughened oversight of Chinese investments, banned US firms from doing business with certain Chinese companies and increased criminal prosecution of alleged technology theft.\n\"What the Trump administration is doing is a sign... the US knows that its geopolitical power will be redefined and reconfigured by this era,\" said Mr Prakash, who works at the Toronto-based Center for Innovating the Future.\nThese developments come amid political tension between the two nations. Yet, some analysts worry the US response is counterproductive, arguing that cutting off access to US microchips, for example, could simply accelerate Chinese efforts to develop their own alternatives.\nThe Trump administration has imposed tariffs on billions of dollars worth of Chinese goods - retaliation for \"unfair\" practices it says are aimed at giving China an advantage in the field.\nThe White House has also pressed universities to review their relationships with Chinese partners and threatened to restrict student visas. It is even said to be looking at rules against certain US investments in China - once nearly unthinkable in free-market America.\nRivals is a season of in-depth coverage on BBC News about the contest for supremacy between the US and China across trade, tech, defence and soft power.\nRead more here.\nThe actions are aimed at preserving US leadership in technologies expected to determine economic and military power for generations to come.\n\"That China will grow to be an economy as large as ours may be inevitable; that we aid their mercantilist strategy through free trade and open investment in our technology sector is a choice,\" US Department of Defense officials wrote in a widely cited 2018 report.\nAs the US and China race to capitalise on advances in machine learning, facial recognition and other forms of artificial intelligence, Tom Mitchell has a front row seat.\nThe professor of computer science founded the world's first research centre for artificial intelligence at Carnegie Mellon in the US. Since 2018, he has also served as chief scientist at Squirrel, a leading tutoring company in China. \nHe says the US has more experience building tech companies, but China may have the advantage when it comes to AI applications relying on big data sets - and points to the medical field as an example.\n\"In the US we've had electronic medical records for over 20 years but we still have not put together all the records in the country to run machine-learning algorithms on those.\" \nHe says the US has been inhibited by privacy concerns, as well as a fractured, for-profit industry. \n\"In China, it's a different situation. If the government decides that it's going to have country-wide electronic medical records... then it's going to happen.\"\nProf Mitchell, who is working on using AI to improve education, says working in both the US and China puts him in the best position to invent and apply cutting-edge technology.\nBut that kind of cross-border collaboration is facing increasing scrutiny, given rising political tensions.\nLast year, Chinese investment in the US dropped to $4.8bn (£3.7bn) - its lowest level since 2011 - while US investment in China dipped from $14bn to $13bn, according to the Rhodium Group's annual report.\nHigh-profile Chinese firms, like insurance giant Anbang and Kai-Fu Lee's Sinovation Ventures, have reportedly sold or scaled back US operations, while China's Huawei and ZTE have suffered serious losses after being subject to US bans. \nIn US academic circles, universities are rethinking their ties to China, while US firms doing business in China have also grown more cautious.\nMr Prakash, who works with start-ups, tech firms and governments on questions of artificial intelligence, says while many western firms continue to pursue opportunities in China, current tensions have changed the discussions.\n\"Geopolitics is now front and centre for all of them,\" he says. \"They're forced to say, hey, we're based in Silicon Valley, we're selling to part of Asia and now as this tech war unfolds we need to understand what's possible, what can we do, what are our options.\"\nMore Technology of Business\nProf Mitchell says policymakers need to distinguish between AI applications that are win-win and those that are truly competitive, such as those for the military.\nIn the meantime, he says Washington's increasingly nationalist tone risks alienating America's foreign students and researchers - many of them Chinese - who have played a critical role in US tech leadership to date.\n\"To start thinking about putting up export control walls around the US could be as damaging to the US research enterprise as anything that a foreign adversary might try to do to us. I hope we will act rationally and not just out of fear.\"\nWhile US concerns about technology theft have merit, \"I feel like we're over-reacting,\" says Prof Mitchell.\n\"The fact that China or the UK or anybody decides they want to be a leader in AI - it would be surprising if they did not. It's not something to be reviled,\" he says.\nAmerican national plans have also called for boosting investment, reforming the immigration system and improving education, but those are much more difficult to achieve, says William Carter, deputy director of technology policy at Washington's Center for Strategic and International Studies.\n\"Being hard on China is an easy political sell,\" he says, but warns that, \"I think we're shooting ourselves in the foot in a lot of ways\".\nThe race between the US and China is now moving to other countries, which are being pushed to take sides as tech firms from the two compete for turf. \nThe US has pressed its allies to stop using equipment from China's Huawei, for example, citing concerns that Beijing could use the firm's equipment for hacking. It has also raised human rights concerns.\nAt a recent conference, a US official argued that Chinese tech companies are \"de facto tools\" of the state's Communist Party, saying they \"have become deeply enmeshed in Beijing's system of oppression at home and its increasingly assertive strategic ambitions globally.\"\nAs artificial intelligence technologies drive debates over values like surveillance and privacy, free speech and censorship, conflicts between the two countries are likely to increase, says Nicholas Wright, a fellow at the New America think tank in Washington, who has worked with the US and UK governments.\n\"To some extent, this is just a generic challenge, where you have a new set of technologies and whomever manages to implement them first and best will gain an advantage... but then there's also another set of issues which is to do with the specifics of these new digital technologies,\" he says.\nFor now, it may take artificial intelligence to know how the race will end.

        "title": "Google to pay for 'high quality' news in new deal",
        "description": "Google says it will pay some news outlets for \"high-quality\" stories that it uses amid pressure from publishers.\nPart of the initiative will require Google to pay for its users to access news stories otherwise locked behind a so-called paywall on certain websites.\nThe first sites to join are in Australia, Brazil, and Germany, with a product launch set for later this year.\nIt comes as authorities in some countries investigate how tech firms use news content without paying for it.\nAustralia has put forward plans to force Google and Facebook to pay news publishers under competition rules. \nFrance has already issued Google with an order to do so.\nIt is the latest development in a long-standing row with news publishers over whether tech giants should pay them to include \"snippets\" of news articles in search results or on social media.\nGoogle characterises its new pitch to solve the problem as a \"licensing programme\", focused on in-depth reporting rather than day-to-day news stories.\nIn an announcement blog post, Google said it would \"pay publishers for high-quality content\".\nGoogle will make some articles from subscription news websites available to its users for free.\n\"Where available, Google will also offer to pay for free access for users to read pay-walled articles on a publisher's site,\" Google said.\n\"This will let pay-walled publishers grow their audiences and open an opportunity for people to read content they might not ordinarily see.\"\nIt is safe to say that the relationship between Google and the news industry has been delicate.  \nPublishers from Rupert Murdoch to Germany's Axel Springer group have long accused the search giant of benefiting from journalism without being prepared to pay for it.\nToday's announcement is the latest in a series of moves by Google to change that narrative. \nPutting money directly into new content sounds great, particularly if it supports struggling local newspapers that are writing important local journalism.\nBut how the plan to pay for free access to pay-walled articles will work is not yet clear. \nIf readers discover that Google will pay for them to get around the paywall, they may be less eager to pay for a long-term newspaper subscription. \nFor years, there has been talk of setting up micropayment systems so that people can buy individual newspaper articles, but those ideas have mostly come to nothing.\nPerhaps Google now sees itself as supplying a payment infrastructure to give the news industry a more secure future - but that again raises questions about just how powerful a role the tech firm will have in deciding what news we all get to read.\nThe initial batch of publications includes Germany's Spiegel group, Australia's regional titles InQueensland and InDaily, and Brazil's Diarios Associados.\nGoogle says it is still in discussions with \"many more partners\" it hopes will sign up to the programme in the near future.\nDespite the intervention of governments and criticism from some publishers, the company insisted its existing products generated \"economic value for publishers\".\nIt argued that its search and news products send readers to news sites more than 24 billion times each month, \"giving publishers the opportunity to offer ads or subscriptions and increase the audience for their content\".\nThere are obstacles getting people to pay for news directly.\nThe latest Reuters Institute Digital News Report found that that most people in all countries are not paying for online news, despite some success stories, such as in Norway (where 42% do) and the United States (20%).\nBut many people say there is nothing that could possibly persuade them to pay for online news - in the US, 40% of people hold that view, according to the report. In the UK, it is 50%.",

        "title": "Illegal lockdown parties hosted in online rentals",
        "description": "Lockdown parties hosted in properties booked via online sites, including Airbnb and Booking.com, are putting \"communities at risk\", the Bed and Breakfast Association has said.\nHosts and residents have complained of groups of up to 30 breaking social-distancing rules and taking drugs.\nBBC News has been told of several such parties in the past month.\nAirbnb said it had gone further than its rivals to protect public health during the pandemic.\nHowever, last week a man was stabbed at a party in a south London property police believe had been rented out via the platform.\nFollowing a previous BBC News investigation into \"coronavirus retreats\", Airbnb had told users they could make bookings only if they were key workers or required “essential stays”. \nBut that restriction is to be lifted, in line with local rules on hotels and self-catering accommodation, in:\nRival platform Booking.com does not currently flag such limits.\n“While B&Bs and guest houses have been closed since 23 March, it seems these giant platforms have allowed bookings to be made and enabled the so-called 'lockdown parties', which have put guests, hosts, neighbours and communities at risk,” Bed and Breakfast Association chairman David Weston said.\n“It is about time these global platforms took some responsibility for the safety of their guests, their accommodation and showed some respect for local communities.”\nAlthough the BBC saw evidence that some of the bookings involved were made via Airbnb, the hosts involved asked that their details not be shared with the company.\nAs a result, the platform said it had seen no evidence to connect the incidents with its business.\n\"We have zero tolerance for illegal activity and Airbnb is the only platform to limit all UK bookings to essential travel for key workers until restrictions are lifted,\" the company said.\n\"We also explicitly ban party houses and our neighbourhood support tool enables anyone to contact us with concerns about a listing in their community, and we take action on issues brought to our attention.\"\nBooking.com did not respond to a request for comment.\nDarya Simanovich, who runs Chelsea Creperie but rents out a property on both Airbnb and Booking.com for extra income, said it had been “trashed” many times since lockdown began, at the end of March, by guests posing as key workers, who had turned out to be organising illegal parties.\n“I wasn’t able to meet the guest because of restrictions,\" she said of one instance.\n\"The key collection was contact-free. \n“But because I live above the property, I saw lots of people going in, with music playing.\n\"So I had to ask them to leave.\n“Letting out your home is all about trust. \n“It’s hard to think people are breaking the rules, especially when hosts have lost income.\n“I don’t think the new guidelines will change anything.\n\"People will still bend the rules.”\nDanial Abbas, who also hosts a flat on both platforms, said a group of more than 10 people held a party there until 04:00 BST last week.\n“I’ve had no problems at all until lockdown,” he said. \n“It’s disappointing that people would flout the rules and create disruption at a time when people are already feeling unnerved. \n\"I’m sad that they’ve created an extra risk.”\nAnother host, who asked to remain anonymous, had a group of younger adults partying in her property.\n“They’re less at risk,\" she said.\n\"They feel hard done by, as lockdown measures are largely for older people. \n“They feel like they’re missing out, so don’t care if they break the rules.”\nNext month, people in England are allowed to meet indoors in groups of up to two households.\nBut there is concern this will be difficult to enforce in short-term lets.\n“The guidance as it stands is unenforceable,” Holiday Home Association chief executive Martin Sach said. \n“It’s too complicated and not law.\n\"So self-catering owners aren’t able to police this. \n\"You can’t verify the relationship of your guests.”\nMerilee Karr, who chairs the UK Short Term Accommodation Association, which represents short-term rental businesses, including Airbnb, said people should have made bookings only if they had legitimate reasons to do so, such as being a key worker or needing hospital treatment.\n“We have been vigilant and very strict about taking bookings during lockdown and have openly opposed anyone breaching the guidelines,\" she said.\n\"We totally disapprove of anyone that has falsely booked accommodation to hold an activity that falls outside of the government guidelines and take action where this would be discovered.”\nA neighbour to a rental property, who asked to remain anonymous, told BBC News: \"I live in a quiet area in London.\n\"But since the lockdown, and in the last four weeks, there have been four parties in my street.\n\"You can spot them right away. \n\"They only stay for one night, arrive in groups of up to 20 people, coming in and out of the house.\n\"I’ve been kept up all night by the loud music that has played until 05:00.\n\"And you can see and smell evidence of drug-taking.\n\"When it happens, I’ve wanted to knock on the door and confront them.\n\"But I have no idea who these people are, which can be scary and threatening, especially when we aren’t meant to be in crowds.\n\"It’s happening because people don’t have anywhere else to go at the moment.\n\"And they want to drink and socialise.\n\"Action needs to be taken.\n\"It’s not right to have a party house in the middle of a residential area, especially during a pandemic.\"",

        "title": "Does anyone have a working contact-tracing app?",
        "description": "The claim: No country in the world has a working contact-tracing app.\nVerdict: There are certainly countries in the world that would dispute that. Germany's app is up and running and India says its app has had 131 million downloads and traced 900,000 people to tell them to isolate.\nAt Prime Minister's Questions on 24 June, Boris Johnson said: \"No country in the world has a working contact-tracing app.\"\nHe had previously challenged Labour leader Keir Starmer to name a country that has a \"functional\" contact-tracing app. He replied: \"Germany - app working 15 June - 12 million downloads.\"\nContact-tracing apps are downloaded to people's smartphones and the idea is that if somebody tests positive for Covid-19, the app will be able to report whether they have been in close contact with anybody else who had downloaded the app.\nThe people with whom they have been in close contact can then be contacted and told to isolate themselves.\nGermany has definitely launched its app - on 25 June it had been downloaded 13 million times. The population of Germany is about 83 million.\nThe number of downloads is clearly crucial to the success of a contact-tracing app because the more people who have it the more likely you are to detect an infection.\nWhen the app was launched, German Chancellor Angela Merkel said: \"The Corona-Warn-App is an important tool when it comes to tracing and breaking chains of infection.\"\nFigures for how many people have been traced by the app have not yet been published. \nThe German health ministry declined to give a statement in response to Boris Johnson's comments, but it clearly believes its app is up and running. \nIndia launched its app called Aarogya Setu on 2 April.\nThe Indian government describes its app as the most downloaded healthcare app in the world with around 131 million downloads.\nIndia made it mandatory for government and private sector employees to download it. There has been some controversy about the app and the government published its source code last month following concerns about security and privacy.\nIts latest tracing data was published a month ago. So far, the platform has contacted more than 900,000 users and told them to self-isolate.\nThe government said that of those who were recommended for testing, almost a quarter of them tested positive.\nProf Martin Hibberd from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine says there is no question that a number of countries have a working contact tracing app.\n\"The point is that these apps are working, but not yet reaching sufficient percentages of the population to be relied on as the sole means of contact tracing,\" he said. \n\"They are an excellent supplement to standard contact tracing though.\"\nProf Hibberd highlights Singapore's Trace Together app which he says has been working since March.\nSingapore is now planning to distribute wearable devices for people without smartphones to increase the proportion of the population using them.\nIt has not been a completely smooth process though - there have been complaints that the system drains the phone battery, which has led some people to switch it off.\nThe country is running at about 200 new infections per day at the moment.\nMarcel Salathé - an expert in digital epidemiology who advises the Swiss contact-tracing app initiative - referring to Boris Johnson's claim said: \"I'm not sure what he means; Switzerland, Latvia, Italy, Germany and Denmark already have functioning proximity tracing apps, many other countries are releasing theirs in the coming days and weeks.\" \n\"How effective they are remains to be seen, but they are certainly functioning.\"\nFrance launched its app three weeks ago. Two million people downloaded it (although 460,000 have uninstalled it since) - according to figures announced at a government press conference.\nSo far, 68 people used it to say they had Covid-19 and 14 people have been traced and warned they are at risk of infection. \nThe French Digital Economy Minister Cedric O told the briefing that the low numbers reflected a decrease in the number of infections in France.\nFrance has had about 500 new cases a day in the past week.\nHe conceded that the number of downloads was disappointing compared with Germany, but he said the app would be useful if there was a fresh spike in the number of cases.\nSo the French government clearly thinks its app is working, even if downloads have been somewhat low so far.\nWhat claims do you want BBC Reality Check to investigate?

        "description": "The US Defense Department has determined that 20 top Chinese firms, including Huawei, are either owned by or backed by the Chinese military.\nThe list, seen by US media, features video surveillance firm Hikvision, China Telecoms, China Mobile and AVIC.\nThe determination could lay the groundwork for new US financial sanctions against the firms. \nIt comes as the US has pressured other countries, including the UK, to bar Huawei for national security reasons.\nThe BBC understands that the list has been published in order to inform congressional committees, US businesses, investors and other potential partners of Chinese firms about the role such firms may play in transferring sensitive technology to the Chinese military. The list is also likely to grow. \nUnder US law, the Defense Department is required to track firms \"owned or controlled\" by China's People's Liberation Army that are active in the US.\nThe Pentagon has been under pressure in recent months from lawmakers of both the Democrats and Republican parties to publish and update the list. \nIn November, US senators Tom Cotton and Chuck Schumer wrote a letter to Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross, asking for an update on reviews of US policy that are mandated by the Export Control Reform Act of 2018 and the 2019 National Defense Authorization Act.\nIn the letter, the senators emphasised their concerns about the danger of exporting critical US technologies to companies with Chinese ties.\nThey also questioned why the Commerce Department had been slow to complete export-control reviews mandated by the two acts.\nThe senators stressed that reviews should be conducted to assess whether the Chinese Communist Party had been stealing US technology with military applications, as well as whether it had been enlisting Chinese corporations to harness emerging civilian technologies for military purposes.\n\"What is the status of this review and implementation of the results? Will this review determine specific sectors of the US economy that the Chinese are targeting for espionage and forced technology-transfer efforts? Will you modify the scope of controls for military end uses and end-users in China? Will you make the results of this review public?,\" wrote Mr Cotton and Mr Schumer.\n\"We urge you to conduct these mandatory reviews as quickly and thoroughly as possible. Thank you for your time and attention to this important matter of national security.\"\nThe White House already taken several steps against Huawei and other Chinese firms, including barring US companies from selling them certain technology without permission. The administration has also said its trade war with China, which resulted in billions of dollars worth of tariffs, was a response to theft of US trade secrets.\nBut it has faced calls by some in Washington to act more aggressively.\nHuawei has contested US claims against it as \"unsubstantiated allegations\".",

        "description": "Mobile network O2 has been sending some of its former customers refunds, 15 years after the end of their contracts.\nSeveral people posted on Twitter that they had received a letter and cheque from parent company Telefonica stating: \"You've got a refund.\"\nSome were suspicious that the letter was sent by cyber-fraudsters.\nBut O2 confirmed that it had sent cheques to a group of people who were over-charged more than 10 years ago - with interest.\n\"We identified a billing issue which meant some customers were charged twice on their final bill before leaving O2. We have been contacting those affected to apologise and send their refund,\" the company said in a statement.\nOne customer said they had been offered a refund of £127, while another was sent a cheque for about £2.\nIn the attached letter, Telefonica said the refund amounts included 4% interest.\n\"We have a responsibility to do all we can to reimburse any customer for what's rightfully theirs, even if they've since left the network and it's a low-value amount,\" the company said.\nO2 said it had identified a group customers it had over-charged at the beginning of the year, but had delayed sending out cheques until coronavirus lockdown measures had been eased. It told the BBC it was not a common issue.\nThe company also said it had made efforts to trace former customers' latest addresses, so that it could issue the 15-year-old refunds.",

        "title": "Google to pay for 'high quality' news in new deal",
        "description": "Google says it will pay some news outlets for \"high-quality\" stories that it uses amid pressure from publishers.\nPart of the initiative will require Google to pay for its users to access news stories otherwise locked behind a so-called paywall on certain websites.\nThe first sites to join are in Australia, Brazil, and Germany, with a product launch set for later this year.\nIt comes as authorities in some countries investigate how tech firms use news content without paying for it.\nAustralia has put forward plans to force Google and Facebook to pay news publishers under competition rules. \nFrance has already issued Google with an order to do so.\nIt is the latest development in a long-standing row with news publishers over whether tech giants should pay them to include \"snippets\" of news articles in search results or on social media.\nGoogle characterises its new pitch to solve the problem as a \"licensing programme\", focused on in-depth reporting rather than day-to-day news stories.\nIn an announcement blog post, Google said it would \"pay publishers for high-quality content\".\nGoogle will make some articles from subscription news websites available to its users for free.\n\"Where available, Google will also offer to pay for free access for users to read pay-walled articles on a publisher's site,\" Google said.\n\"This will let pay-walled publishers grow their audiences and open an opportunity for people to read content they might not ordinarily see.\"\nIt is safe to say that the relationship between Google and the news industry has been delicate.  \nPublishers from Rupert Murdoch to Germany's Axel Springer group have long accused the search giant of benefiting from journalism without being prepared to pay for it.\nToday's announcement is the latest in a series of moves by Google to change that narrative. \nPutting money directly into new content sounds great, particularly if it supports struggling local newspapers that are writing important local journalism.\nBut how the plan to pay for free access to pay-walled articles will work is not yet clear. \nIf readers discover that Google will pay for them to get around the paywall, they may be less eager to pay for a long-term newspaper subscription. \nFor years, there has been talk of setting up micropayment systems so that people can buy individual newspaper articles, but those ideas have mostly come to nothing.\nPerhaps Google now sees itself as supplying a payment infrastructure to give the news industry a more secure future - but that again raises questions about just how powerful a role the tech firm will have in deciding what news we all get to read.\nThe initial batch of publications includes Germany's Spiegel group, Australia's regional titles InQueensland and InDaily, and Brazil's Diarios Associados.\nGoogle says it is still in discussions with \"many more partners\" it hopes will sign up to the programme in the near future.\nDespite the intervention of governments and criticism from some publishers, the company insisted its existing products generated \"economic value for publishers\".\nIt argued that its search and news products send readers to news sites more than 24 billion times each month, \"giving publishers the opportunity to offer ads or subscriptions and increase the audience for their content\".\nThere are obstacles getting people to pay for news directly.\nThe latest Reuters Institute Digital News Report found that that most people in all countries are not paying for online news, despite some success stories, such as in Norway (where 42% do) and the United States (20%).\nBut many people say there is nothing that could possibly persuade them to pay for online news - in the US, 40% of people hold that view, according to the report. In the UK, it is 50%.",

        "title": "Illegal lockdown parties hosted in online rentals",
        "description": "Lockdown parties hosted in properties booked via online sites, including Airbnb and Booking.com, are putting \"communities at risk\", the Bed and Breakfast Association has said.\nHosts and residents have complained of groups of up to 30 breaking social-distancing rules and taking drugs.\nBBC News has been told of several such parties in the past month.\nAirbnb said it had gone further than its rivals to protect public health during the pandemic.\nHowever, last week a man was stabbed at a party in a south London property police believe had been rented out via the platform.\nFollowing a previous BBC News investigation into \"coronavirus retreats\", Airbnb had told users they could make bookings only if they were key workers or required “essential stays”. \nBut that restriction is to be lifted, in line with local rules on hotels and self-catering accommodation, in:\nRival platform Booking.com does not currently flag such limits.\n“While B&Bs and guest houses have been closed since 23 March, it seems these giant platforms have allowed bookings to be made and enabled the so-called 'lockdown parties', which have put guests, hosts, neighbours and communities at risk,” Bed and Breakfast Association chairman David Weston said.\n“It is about time these global platforms took some responsibility for the safety of their guests, their accommodation and showed some respect for local communities.”\nAlthough the BBC saw evidence that some of the bookings involved were made via Airbnb, the hosts involved asked that their details not be shared with the company.\nAs a result, the platform said it had seen no evidence to connect the incidents with its business.\n\"We have zero tolerance for illegal activity and Airbnb is the only platform to limit all UK bookings to essential travel for key workers until restrictions are lifted,\" the company said.\n\"We also explicitly ban party houses and our neighbourhood support tool enables anyone to contact us with concerns about a listing in their community, and we take action on issues brought to our attention.\"\nBooking.com did not respond to a request for comment.\nDarya Simanovich, who runs Chelsea Creperie but rents out a property on both Airbnb and Booking.com for extra income, said it had been “trashed” many times since lockdown began, at the end of March, by guests posing as key workers, who had turned out to be organising illegal parties.\n“I wasn’t able to meet the guest because of restrictions,\" she said of one instance.\n\"The key collection was contact-free. \n“But because I live above the property, I saw lots of people going in, with music playing.\n\"So I had to ask them to leave.\n“Letting out your home is all about trust. \n“It’s hard to think people are breaking the rules, especially when hosts have lost income.\n“I don’t think the new guidelines will change anything.\n\"People will still bend the rules.”\nDanial Abbas, who also hosts a flat on both platforms, said a group of more than 10 people held a party there until 04:00 BST last week.\n“I’ve had no problems at all until lockdown,” he said. \n“It’s disappointing that people would flout the rules and create disruption at a time when people are already feeling unnerved. \n\"I’m sad that they’ve created an extra risk.”\nAnother host, who asked to remain anonymous, had a group of younger adults partying in her property.\n“They’re less at risk,\" she said.\n\"They feel hard done by, as lockdown measures are largely for older people. \n“They feel like they’re missing out, so don’t care if they break the rules.”\nNext month, people in England are allowed to meet indoors in groups of up to two households.\nBut there is concern this will be difficult to enforce in short-term lets.\n“The guidance as it stands is unenforceable,” Holiday Home Association chief executive Martin Sach said. \n“It’s too complicated and not law.\n\"So self-catering owners aren’t able to police this. \n\"You can’t verify the relationship of your guests.”\nMerilee Karr, who chairs the UK Short Term Accommodation Association, which represents short-term rental businesses, including Airbnb, said people should have made bookings only if they had legitimate reasons to do so, such as being a key worker or needing hospital treatment.\n“We have been vigilant and very strict about taking bookings during lockdown and have openly opposed anyone breaching the guidelines,\" she said.\n\"We totally disapprove of anyone that has falsely booked accommodation to hold an activity that falls outside of the government guidelines and take action where this would be discovered.”\nA neighbour to a rental property, who asked to remain anonymous, told BBC News: \"I live in a quiet area in London.\n\"But since the lockdown, and in the last four weeks, there have been four parties in my street.\n\"You can spot them right away. \n\"They only stay for one night, arrive in groups of up to 20 people, coming in and out of the house.\n\"I’ve been kept up all night by the loud music that has played until 05:00.\n\"And you can see and smell evidence of drug-taking.\n\"When it happens, I’ve wanted to knock on the door and confront them.\n\"But I have no idea who these people are, which can be scary and threatening, especially when we aren’t meant to be in crowds.\n\"It’s happening because people don’t have anywhere else to go at the moment.\n\"And they want to drink and socialise.\n\"Action needs to be taken.\n\"It’s not right to have a party house in the middle of a residential area, especially during a pandemic.\"",

        "title": "Google to pay for 'high quality' news in new deal",
        "description": "Google says it will pay some news outlets for \"high-quality\" stories that it uses amid pressure from publishers.\nPart of the initiative will require Google to pay for its users to access news stories otherwise locked behind a so-called paywall on certain websites.\nThe first sites to join are in Australia, Brazil, and Germany, with a product launch set for later this year.\nIt comes as authorities in some countries investigate how tech firms use news content without paying for it.\nAustralia has put forward plans to force Google and Facebook to pay news publishers under competition rules. \nFrance has already issued Google with an order to do so.\nIt is the latest development in a long-standing row with news publishers over whether tech giants should pay them to include \"snippets\" of news articles in search results or on social media.\nGoogle characterises its new pitch to solve the problem as a \"licensing programme\", focused on in-depth reporting rather than day-to-day news stories.\nIn an announcement blog post, Google said it would \"pay publishers for high-quality content\".\nGoogle will make some articles from subscription news websites available to its users for free.\n\"Where available, Google will also offer to pay for free access for users to read pay-walled articles on a publisher's site,\" Google said.\n\"This will let pay-walled publishers grow their audiences and open an opportunity for people to read content they might not ordinarily see.\"\nIt is safe to say that the relationship between Google and the news industry has been delicate.  \nPublishers from Rupert Murdoch to Germany's Axel Springer group have long accused the search giant of benefiting from journalism without being prepared to pay for it.\nToday's announcement is the latest in a series of moves by Google to change that narrative. \nPutting money directly into new content sounds great, particularly if it supports struggling local newspapers that are writing important local journalism.\nBut how the plan to pay for free access to pay-walled articles will work is not yet clear. \nIf readers discover that Google will pay for them to get around the paywall, they may be less eager to pay for a long-term newspaper subscription. \nFor years, there has been talk of setting up micropayment systems so that people can buy individual newspaper articles, but those ideas have mostly come to nothing.\nPerhaps Google now sees itself as supplying a payment infrastructure to give the news industry a more secure future - but that again raises questions about just how powerful a role the tech firm will have in deciding what news we all get to read.\nThe initial batch of publications includes Germany's Spiegel group, Australia's regional titles InQueensland and InDaily, and Brazil's Diarios Associados.\nGoogle says it is still in discussions with \"many more partners\" it hopes will sign up to the programme in the near future.\nDespite the intervention of governments and criticism from some publishers, the company insisted its existing products generated \"economic value for publishers\".\nIt argued that its search and news products send readers to news sites more than 24 billion times each month, \"giving publishers the opportunity to offer ads or subscriptions and increase the audience for their content\".\nThere are obstacles getting people to pay for news directly.\nThe latest Reuters Institute Digital News Report found that that most people in all countries are not paying for online news, despite some success stories, such as in Norway (where 42% do) and the United States (20%).\nBut many people say there is nothing that could possibly persuade them to pay for online news - in the US, 40% of people hold that view, according to the report. In the UK, it is 50%.",

        "title": "Illegal lockdown parties hosted in online rentals",
        "description": "Lockdown parties hosted in properties booked via online sites, including Airbnb and Booking.com, are putting \"communities at risk\", the Bed and Breakfast Association has said.\nHosts and residents have complained of groups of up to 30 breaking social-distancing rules and taking drugs.\nBBC News has been told of several such parties in the past month.\nAirbnb said it had gone further than its rivals to protect public health during the pandemic.\nHowever, last week a man was stabbed at a party in a south London property police believe had been rented out via the platform.\nFollowing a previous BBC News investigation into \"coronavirus retreats\", Airbnb had told users they could make bookings only if they were key workers or required “essential stays”. \nBut that restriction is to be lifted, in line with local rules on hotels and self-catering accommodation, in:\nRival platform Booking.com does not currently flag such limits.\n“While B&Bs and guest houses have been closed since 23 March, it seems these giant platforms have allowed bookings to be made and enabled the so-called 'lockdown parties', which have put guests, hosts, neighbours and communities at risk,” Bed and Breakfast Association chairman David Weston said.\n“It is about time these global platforms took some responsibility for the safety of their guests, their accommodation and showed some respect for local communities.”\nAlthough the BBC saw evidence that some of the bookings involved were made via Airbnb, the hosts involved asked that their details not be shared with the company.\nAs a result, the platform said it had seen no evidence to connect the incidents with its business.\n\"We have zero tolerance for illegal activity and Airbnb is the only platform to limit all UK bookings to essential travel for key workers until restrictions are lifted,\" the company said.\n\"We also explicitly ban party houses and our neighbourhood support tool enables anyone to contact us with concerns about a listing in their community, and we take action on issues brought to our attention.\"\nBooking.com did not respond to a request for comment.\nDarya Simanovich, who runs Chelsea Creperie but rents out a property on both Airbnb and Booking.com for extra income, said it had been “trashed” many times since lockdown began, at the end of March, by guests posing as key workers, who had turned out to be organising illegal parties.\n“I wasn’t able to meet the guest because of restrictions,\" she said of one instance.\n\"The key collection was contact-free. \n“But because I live above the property, I saw lots of people going in, with music playing.\n\"So I had to ask them to leave.\n“Letting out your home is all about trust. \n“It’s hard to think people are breaking the rules, especially when hosts have lost income.\n“I don’t think the new guidelines will change anything.\n\"People will still bend the rules.”\nDanial Abbas, who also hosts a flat on both platforms, said a group of more than 10 people held a party there until 04:00 BST last week.\n“I’ve had no problems at all until lockdown,” he said. \n“It’s disappointing that people would flout the rules and create disruption at a time when people are already feeling unnerved. \n\"I’m sad that they’ve created an extra risk.”\nAnother host, who asked to remain anonymous, had a group of younger adults partying in her property.\n“They’re less at risk,\" she said.\n\"They feel hard done by, as lockdown measures are largely for older people. \n“They feel like they’re missing out, so don’t care if they break the rules.”\nNext month, people in England are allowed to meet indoors in groups of up to two households.\nBut there is concern this will be difficult to enforce in short-term lets.\n“The guidance as it stands is unenforceable,” Holiday Home Association chief executive Martin Sach said. \n“It’s too complicated and not law.\n\"So self-catering owners aren’t able to police this. \n\"You can’t verify the relationship of your guests.”\nMerilee Karr, who chairs the UK Short Term Accommodation Association, which represents short-term rental businesses, including Airbnb, said people should have made bookings only if they had legitimate reasons to do so, such as being a key worker or needing hospital treatment.\n“We have been vigilant and very strict about taking bookings during lockdown and have openly opposed anyone breaching the guidelines,\" she said.\n\"We totally disapprove of anyone that has falsely booked accommodation to hold an activity that falls outside of the government guidelines and take action where this would be discovered.”\nA neighbour to a rental property, who asked to remain anonymous, told BBC News: \"I live in a quiet area in London.\n\"But since the lockdown, and in the last four weeks, there have been four parties in my street.\n\"You can spot them right away. \n\"They only stay for one night, arrive in groups of up to 20 people, coming in and out of the house.\n\"I’ve been kept up all night by the loud music that has played until 05:00.\n\"And you can see and smell evidence of drug-taking.\n\"When it happens, I’ve wanted to knock on the door and confront them.\n\"But I have no idea who these people are, which can be scary and threatening, especially when we aren’t meant to be in crowds.\n\"It’s happening because people don’t have anywhere else to go at the moment.\n\"And they want to drink and socialise.\n\"Action needs to be taken.\n\"It’s not right to have a party house in the middle of a residential area, especially during a pandemic.\"",

        "title": "Does anyone have a working contact-tracing app?",
        "description": "The claim: No country in the world has a working contact-tracing app.\nVerdict: There are certainly countries in the world that would dispute that. Germany's app is up and running and India says its app has had 131 million downloads and traced 900,000 people to tell them to isolate.\nAt Prime Minister's Questions on 24 June, Boris Johnson said: \"No country in the world has a working contact-tracing app.\"\nHe had previously challenged Labour leader Keir Starmer to name a country that has a \"functional\" contact-tracing app. He replied: \"Germany - app working 15 June - 12 million downloads.\"\nContact-tracing apps are downloaded to people's smartphones and the idea is that if somebody tests positive for Covid-19, the app will be able to report whether they have been in close contact with anybody else who had downloaded the app.\nThe people with whom they have been in close contact can then be contacted and told to isolate themselves.\nGermany has definitely launched its app - on 25 June it had been downloaded 13 million times. The population of Germany is about 83 million.\nThe number of downloads is clearly crucial to the success of a contact-tracing app because the more people who have it the more likely you are to detect an infection.\nWhen the app was launched, German Chancellor Angela Merkel said: \"The Corona-Warn-App is an important tool when it comes to tracing and breaking chains of infection.\"\nFigures for how many people have been traced by the app have not yet been published. \nThe German health ministry declined to give a statement in response to Boris Johnson's comments, but it clearly believes its app is up and running. \nIndia launched its app called Aarogya Setu on 2 April.\nThe Indian government describes its app as the most downloaded healthcare app in the world with around 131 million downloads.\nIndia made it mandatory for government and private sector employees to download it. There has been some controversy about the app and the government published its source code last month following concerns about security and privacy.\nIts latest tracing data was published a month ago. So far, the platform has contacted more than 900,000 users and told them to self-isolate.\nThe government said that of those who were recommended for testing, almost a quarter of them tested positive.\nProf Martin Hibberd from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine says there is no question that a number of countries have a working contact tracing app.\n\"The point is that these apps are working, but not yet reaching sufficient percentages of the population to be relied on as the sole means of contact tracing,\" he said. \n\"They are an excellent supplement to standard contact tracing though.\"\nProf Hibberd highlights Singapore's Trace Together app which he says has been working since March.\nSingapore is now planning to distribute wearable devices for people without smartphones to increase the proportion of the population using them.\nIt has not been a completely smooth process though - there have been complaints that the system drains the phone battery, which has led some people to switch it off.\nThe country is running at about 200 new infections per day at the moment.\nMarcel Salathé - an expert in digital epidemiology who advises the Swiss contact-tracing app initiative - referring to Boris Johnson's claim said: \"I'm not sure what he means; Switzerland, Latvia, Italy, Germany and Denmark already have functioning proximity tracing apps, many other countries are releasing theirs in the coming days and weeks.\" \n\"How effective they are remains to be seen, but they are certainly functioning.\"\nFrance launched its app three weeks ago. Two million people downloaded it (although 460,000 have uninstalled it since) - according to figures announced at a government press conference.\nSo far, 68 people used it to say they had Covid-19 and 14 people have been traced and warned they are at risk of infection. \nThe French Digital Economy Minister Cedric O told the briefing that the low numbers reflected a decrease in the number of infections in France.\nFrance has had about 500 new cases a day in the past week.\nHe conceded that the number of downloads was disappointing compared with Germany, but he said the app would be useful if there was a fresh spike in the number of cases.\nSo the French government clearly thinks its app is working, even if downloads have been somewhat low so far.\nWhat claims do you want BBC Reality Check to investigate?

        "description": "The US Defense Department has determined that 20 top Chinese firms, including Huawei, are either owned by or backed by the Chinese military.\nThe list, seen by US media, features video surveillance firm Hikvision, China Telecoms, China Mobile and AVIC.\nThe determination could lay the groundwork for new US financial sanctions against the firms. \nIt comes as the US has pressured other countries, including the UK, to bar Huawei for national security reasons.\nThe BBC understands that the list has been published in order to inform congressional committees, US businesses, investors and other potential partners of Chinese firms about the role such firms may play in transferring sensitive technology to the Chinese military. The list is also likely to grow. \nUnder US law, the Defense Department is required to track firms \"owned or controlled\" by China's People's Liberation Army that are active in the US.\nThe Pentagon has been under pressure in recent months from lawmakers of both the Democrats and Republican parties to publish and update the list. \nIn November, US senators Tom Cotton and Chuck Schumer wrote a letter to Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross, asking for an update on reviews of US policy that are mandated by the Export Control Reform Act of 2018 and the 2019 National Defense Authorization Act.\nIn the letter, the senators emphasised their concerns about the danger of exporting critical US technologies to companies with Chinese ties.\nThey also questioned why the Commerce Department had been slow to complete export-control reviews mandated by the two acts.\nThe senators stressed that reviews should be conducted to assess whether the Chinese Communist Party had been stealing US technology with military applications, as well as whether it had been enlisting Chinese corporations to harness emerging civilian technologies for military purposes.\n\"What is the status of this review and implementation of the results? Will this review determine specific sectors of the US economy that the Chinese are targeting for espionage and forced technology-transfer efforts?

        "description": "Google is changing its default settings to automatically delete some of the data it collects about users.\nWeb and app activity, including a log of website searches and pages visited, as well as location data, will now be wiped after 18 months.\nYouTube histories - including which clips were watched and for how long - will be erased after 36 months.\nThe changes apply to new accounts only but existing users will soon be shown new prompts to adjust their settings.\nThe announcement comes as Google and other big technology companies' data-collection efforts and business practices face increased scrutiny.\nThe Wall Street Journal has reported the US Department of Justice is to meet with state attorneys general later this week to discuss plans to punish Google for anti-competitive behaviour, including an allegation it has abused its dominance in online search.\nAnd, on Tuesday, a German court imposed curbs on the data Facebook collects about local users, over concerns it has been abusing its market-leading position among social networks.\nGoogle introduced auto-delete controls in May 2019, to let users force the regular erasure of logs gathered about them by the company, but made this an opt-in option at the time.\nThe US technology company draws on this information to produce personalised recommendations and search results, as well as to target ads.\n\"We know that information makes our products helpful,\" Google product manager David Monsees said.\n\"But data minimisation is one of our important privacy principles [and] Google will no longer keep activity indefinitely unless you ask us to.\"\nGoogle said it wanted to hold on to YouTube records for longer than other internet activities, as this would help it do things such as make music recommendations, for which a longer search history was beneficial.\nAnd it added the auto-wipe policy would not apply to logs linked to Photos, Gmail and its Drive cloud-storage facility, which it said it did not draw on for advertising purposes.\nThe company has justified its decision not to apply the change to existing accounts on the basis it does not want to catch people out by wiping \"curated\" data without their express permission. \nAnd it noted all users could choose to set the auto-wipe period to as little as three months.\nHowever, it does mean the change will affect far fewer people than it might have.\nLong-time users will be affected by other measures, though, including being shown new \"guided tips\" .\nFor example, if someone uses Google Search to ask if their account is secure, a box will appear showing their settings and providing a way to adjust them.\nIn addition, other related \"dynamic cards\" should be introduced shortly. \nIn one instance, if a user opts to share their handset's location with a friend, they will later be reminded the permission is still active and asked if they want to turn it off.\nGoogle said it had also made it \"easier to access\" Incognito Mode in its apps - a setting that suspends data-logging - by letting users turn on the facility by pressing and holding their profile picture. \n\"Many people are uncomfortable with the amount of information Google keeps,\" said Jim Killock, executive director of the Open Rights Group.\n\"Prompts could mean a range of things people do their best to ignore.\n\"Google should ensure that everyone has made a clear indication about whether they want their histories stored and for how long, rather than whether they have swiped away some notice they half read.\"",

        "description": "\"I felt pressured into sharing, but I'm kind of glad it happened.\"\nIn May, TikTok star Loren Gray revealed she had been sexually assaulted at the age of 12. \nIt was only after receiving a message that someone knew and might share her story \"in the wrong way\", that she decided to speak.\nIn her only interview about it since, the 18-year-old tells Radio 1 Newsbeat she's grateful for the positive response. \n\"It was really difficult for me, because I didn't know what to expect. And I was afraid that people were going to look at me differently.\"\n\"I wasn't prepared for it, you never can be. It was hard but I feel like I handled it in the best way I could.\"\nIn the TikTok video, Loren wrote she was assaulted in a basement belonging to somebody she trusted.\n\"I struggled to put the pieces together as to why this had happened to me. I felt dirty, hopeless, broken, and worthless,\" the American added on the video.\nLoren didn't tell anyone, including her parents, that she was planning on sharing publicly what happened to her.\n\"I just went for it because at the end of the day, it's my story. So it's on me when I share.\n\"But my parents were really proud,\" she adds.\nthank you. pic.twitter.com/s3qDMXadfu\nEnd of Twitter post  by @iamlorengray\nLoren says she hasn't reported what happened to the authorities.\n\"I didn't because at the time, it wasn't right for my healing process.\"\nBut she knows reporting \"can help and be right for other people\".\nCircumstances were different for her because her parents \"had never dealt with anything\" like that so they \"were really unsure about what to do\".\n\"By the time I told anyone, it had already been a couple of months. I just wanted to move forward.\"\nLoren has more than 60 million followers across her social media pages. Since sharing, she says many of her fans have told their own stories of being sexually assaulted.\nIt shows \"you never really know what's going on in someone's life\".\n\"But I'm glad I could help people share their own stories, because it's something that happens to a lot of people.\"\nIf you need support with any of the issues raised in this article, these organisations may be able to help.\nAccording to the Rape, Abuse & Incest National Network, 15% of sexual assault victims in the US are aged between 12 and 17.\nInitially, Loren blamed herself for the assault. She says there are always questions inside about what could have happened instead.\n\"You ask 'What if I did this differently, or what would have happened if I did something else?'\"\n\"It's a natural feeling. But it takes a lot of learning and realisation to realise it's not your fault and talking to people really helps.\"\nHaving other people hear what she was going through helped ease some of those feelings.\n\"Even though it's really difficult for people to understand, for me, talking to my parents was really hard, but in the end was like therapy.\"\nThe other thing which helped Loren was making videos, which she started doing a few months after the incident to pass time when being home schooled.\n\"I feel making videos separated the two worlds, especially once I started gaining a following.\n\"It helped me separate what I was feeling and the life that I could have.\"\nShe credits her fans for helping her get through a tough time. \n\"They didn't know what had happened, so they were just there to support me in what I was doing and what I'm passionate about, which is making videos.\"\nThe most important thing for Loren was to not let what happened control her future.\n\"I know that especially at the time, it feels really life defining.\" \n\"You'll look at yourself differently, even thinking other people are looking at you differently, even when they aren't,\" she adds.\n\"But it's important to know that's not always the case. There's always a light at the end of the tunnel.\"\nFollow Newsbeat on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter and YouTube.\nListen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 weekdays - or listen back here.",

        "title": "Olympus quits camera business after 84 years",
        "description": "Olympus, once one of the world's biggest camera brands, is selling off that part of its business after 84 years.\nThe firm said that despite its best efforts, the \"extremely severe digital camera market\" was no longer profitable.\nThe arrival of smartphones, which had shrunk the market for separate cameras, was one major factor, it said.\nIt had recorded losses for the last three years.\nThe Japanese company made its first camera in 1936 after years of microscope manufacture. The Semi-Olympus I featured an accordion-like fold-out camera bellows, and cost more than a month's wages in Japan.\nThe company continued to develop the camera business over the decades, becoming one of the top companies by market share.\n\"There's a huge amount of affection for Olympus, going right back,\" says Nigel Atherton, editor of Amateur Photographer magazine.\nThe 1970s was a high point, with their cameras advertised on television by celebrity photographers such as David Bailey and Lord Lichfield.\n\"Those cameras were revolutionary - they were very small, very light, they were beautifully designed, had really nice quality lenses,\" adds Atherton.\nA cult following stayed with the firm, despite teething issues with new technologies such as autofocus, Atherton says. But the firm had a second wave with digital cameras, where they were early adopters.\nBut they targeted their later range of mirrorless cameras at a middle market - \"people who weren't serious photographers - they wanted something better than a point-and-shoot camera, but they didn't want a DSLR camera\".\n\"That market very very quickly got swallowed up by smartphones, and turned out not to exist.\"\nThe market for standalone cameras has fallen dramatically - by one estimate, it dropped by 84% between 2010 and 2018.\n\"Olympus I find a very frustrating company,\" Atherton says. \"Continually over the last few years, they've constantly got it wrong, made wrong decisions, taken wrong turns, and gone down cul-de-sacs.\"\nOne example he cited was the lack of progress in video performance, where rivals have made strides.\nThe company also faced a major financial scandal involving senior executives in 2011.\nOlympus is now seeking to strike a deal to carve off the camera part of its business so that its brands - such as Zuiko lenses - can be used in new products by another firm, Japan Industrial Partners.\nIn a statement, the Japanese company said that it was business as usual until then. \n\"We believe this is the right step to preserve the legacy of the brand,\" the statement said.\nOn social media, however, its UK team accepted that fans \"may have many questions\".\n\"We ask for your patience... Olympus sees this potential transfer as an opportunity to enable our imaging business to grow and delight both long-time and new photography enthusiasts,\" it said.\nOlympus Corporation, however, will continue.\nThe company never stopped making microscopes, and has turned its optical technology to other scientific and medical equipment such as endoscopes.",

        "title": "Fancy a pint? You might need an app for that",
        "description": "Fancy a pint in the pub? From 4 July, you can have one - or indeed a mojito or an orange juice - in England. \nBut you probably won't be able to stroll up to the bar and order what you fancy. \nAnd in many places, you may find you need an app for that. \nThe government has published a lengthy document, giving guidance to restaurants, pubs and takeaways on all the measures they will need to take to operate safely.\nOne paragraph stands out: \"The opening up of the economy following the Covid-19 outbreak is being supported by NHS Test and Trace. You should assist this service by keeping a temporary record of your customers and visitors for 21 days, in a way that is manageable for your business, and assist NHS Test and Trace with requests for that data if needed.\"\nJust what customer details should be kept - and how - is unclear. \nBut the government promises to work with the industry \"to design this system in line with data-protection legislation and set out details shortly\". \nFor restaurants and the posher sort of pub where you can book a table for a meal, this should not pose too much of a problem.\nThey are likely to have a system already in place to record customer details.\nThey will simply have to tinker with it to make sure it collects everybody's name, not just that of the person paying. \nBut for thousands of old-fashioned boozers - the kind you wander into for a quick pint - it is going to be a lot harder. \nThey may struggle to set up a reliable process to log their customers.\nAnd the result could be a major shift in pub culture.\nSeeing an opportunity, dozens of app developers and payment platforms are rushing to offer services to pubs and restaurants as they prepare to open up. \nAnd I have asked three of them to imagine how their systems would work for a casual drinker dropping by on a whim.\nWilliam Wright's app, YoCa, incorporates Apple Pay, Google Pay and a pre-ordering system. \nIt has already been helping dozens of cafes keep going during the lockdown by offering takeaway services. \nHe is now adapting the app to pubs.\nBut it became clear during our discussion it would involve customers ordering in advance and identify only the person paying, not the others who might have been stood a round.  \nMax Mallows has been helping art galleries handle customers via a service called ArtsVP.\nAnd he is now adapting it for pubs, as PubsVP. \nAgain, it envisages a world where you book in advance to visit a pub.\nBut it is flexible enough to add extra names into the system if you bring along a couple of friends. \nAnd you do not have to download the app.\nYou can just visit a website to enter details.\nBut what about data protection, which the information commissioner has warned will need to be considered by pubs and restaurants storing customer details? \nMr Mallows admits it is going to be complicated, with some data held by both the pub and his company. \nBut he aims to give customers a guarantee data will be deleted after 21 days.\nThe simplest approach I came across was from a company called Eagle Eye.\nAnd it depended on QR codes, a method already adopted in New Zealand. \nChief sales officer Al Henderson tells me what my customer \"journey\" would look like.\n\"You turn up at the Dog and Duck, scan a QR code at the venue, which takes you to a website where you complete your details, first name, last name, phone number, email address,\" he says. \nThen, I receive my own QR code via phone, SMS or email - and use it when I pay.\nPubs will have more data on customers who agree to receive marketing messages.\nBut a close eye will be kept to ensure those who don't want to be contacted have their details wiped after 21 days.\nLandlord Peter Dunn says Ye Old Vaults, a city centre pub in Ashbourne, Derbyshire, used to thrive on Sky Sports events and live music, \"neither of which we can have now\". \nAnd he can't see some of his regulars being willing to fill in a form.\nBut Mr Dunn, who also does a bit of web development, does have an idea of what would work - the government's contact tracing app that was shelved last week.\n\"Licensees do enough work for the government, policing the under-age drinking and stuff like that, without loading us up with that as well,\" he says.\n\"So that's a job that an app could do far better than getting landlords to take personal information off their customers.\" \nIf the NHS-branded Covid-19 app had been rolled out by now and landlords had demanded drinkers proved they were using it before they were allowed in, you can imagine there would have been quite a row over privacy.\nBut instead, the technology of contact tracing is effectively being privatised and made the responsibility of the publicans. \nAnd you can understand why they're not raising a glass to that.",

        "description": "Scandal-hit payments firm Wirecard has filed for insolvency, causing its shares to dive almost 80%.\nIt comes after the German firm last week disclosed a €1.9bn (£1.7bn) hole in its accounts.\nFormer boss Markus Braun has since been arrested and accused of inflating Wirecard's finances to make them appear healthier to investors and customers.\nThe firm's creditors stand to lose billions of euros from the scandal.\nThe controversy erupted last week when auditors EY refused to sign off on firm's company's accounts, having been unable to locate the missing €1.9bn.\nThe Munich based firm, which employs almost 6,000 staff in 26 countries, initially claimed the money was held in accounts at two banks in the Philippines.\nBut on Monday Wirecard said the money simply may not exist.\nIn a statement on Thursday, the firm said its new management had decided to apply for insolvency at a Munich court \"due to impending insolvency and over-indebtedness\".\nThe firm is also evaluating whether to file for insolvency proceedings for its subsidiaries.\nWirecard, which was launched as a start-up in 1999, joined Germany's prestigious Dax 30 share index two years ago at a valuation of €24bn. \nBut the company's shares have crashed almost 100% in the last week, giving it a stock market valuation of less than €400m.\nThe Munich prosecutor's office, which is investigating Mr Braun, said it had now widened its investigation to look at others. \nFormer chief operating officer Jan Marsalek is under suspicion and believed to be in the Philippines, according to the Reuters news agency. \nMeanwhile, Mr Braun has been freed on bail of €5m and remains a suspect.

        "title": "Britain's 'blindingly cool' engineering innovation",
        "description": "Ted Humble-Smith is a conceptual still-life photographer. He's well known for his fashion work. Ted can take a lipstick or a watch and with his extraordinary vision and skill turn the beautiful into something even more gorgeous. \nBut speak to him for just a few minutes and it's clear he sees not just the colour and form of his subjects, but the engineering that underpins their design. \nIn fact, it's obvious Ted has a passion for it. He points to the 4-inch stiletto heel. \n\"Everyone laughs when I talk about it,\" he told me. \"But you have this thing that's so elegant, so beautiful - and yet at the same time, there has to be some serious engineering and mathematics in there as well. \n\"Eight stones at least is going through a square centimetre. These are big loads but you rarely see people snap their heels these days.\" \nTed has just put his inquisitive eye to a project for the Royal Academy of Engineering. \nHe's produced a series of images to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the MacRobert Award, which honours examples of remarkable British innovation. From the aerodynamic design of the Severn Bridge to the composite wing of an Airbus jet. \nThe photos are clearly conceptual in nature but the ideas that went into their creation are drawn directly from conversations with the engineers involved. \nTed took their explanations, extracted the essence and then reimagined his subjects. His favourite photo - at the moment; the choice changes - is the EMI X-ray brain scanner, the world's first computed tomography (CT) machine to be used in a clinical setting (MacRobert winner: 1972). \nAn illuminated, transparent skull is cut through by a rotating disc. The visual narrative describes the process through which X-rays are able to build a picture of the brain, slice by slice. \n\"It's a hell of an invention,\" says Ted. \"When you consider that if you wanted to look inside someone's brain previously, you basically had to take it out, slice it on a bacon slicer and then put it on a lightbox. The CT scanner is phenomenal.\" \nTed builds many of the objects he photographs. At first glance, you might think he's done everything in a software package on his computer. You'd be wrong. \nTed uses models that have been lit in interesting ways and captured under different exposures. For sure, some image frames have been stacked and any scaffolding, such as rods and wires, has been digitally erased. But you'd be able to hold his MacRobert models in your hands. \nWitness the picture he produced of Quantel Paintbox (MacRobert winner: 1988). Wholly apposite in this context. \nPaintbox revolutionised computer graphics on TV and film. It enabled the industry for the first time to properly digitise colour and really play with it on our screens (see the Dire Straits video Money for Nothing). \nIn his image, Ted encodes this in his mind's-eye as paint flying around curved plastic sheets. \"You can freeze liquids in photography now so well. I wanted it to look like paint was exploding on to the screen. So, you can do it in a very complicated way with robots and paint cannons, or you can do it in the slightly haphazard fashion that we did. Basically, you fling paint around.\" \nA wonderful mess in the studio made for a striking image.\nTed's images for the MacRobert 50th anniversary are being showcased in an online exhibition the Royal Academy of Engineering has developed with the National Science and Media Museum in Bradford. You can see it here. And for a taste of the sort of images Ted is best known for, take a look at the gallery on his website.\nThe finalists for the 2020 MacRobert award have just been announced. There are three on the shortlist and they are all recognised for contributing innovation to a greener future. They are: \nProf Sir Richard Friend is the chair of the judging panel. He's also himself a past winner for his work on \"plastic electronics\" - technology that has attained ubiquity in the touchscreens of our mobile phones. \nHe told me: \"The shortlisted companies this year are splendid examples of things you might have thought the UK wasn't the natural place for their innovations to emerge. We sometimes write ourselves out of being world players in quite a few technologies. There's no reason for it and the MacRobert award keeps presenting with cases  that are very obviously world-beating.\"\nIt's a theme emphasised by Ted Humble-Smith, who confesses to have gone on something of a conversion during his photographic projects.\n\"I started out quite despondent about where Britain was in the world - that the UK never seems to do anything anymore,\" he recalled. \"But then I started talking to the present-day people and it just gave me a whole new belief that actually there's some blindingly cool stuff happening in the UK. The UK does make and innovate some incredible things.\"\nJonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter: @BBCAmos",

        "title": "Creating an online course 'changed my life'",
        "description": "Like many others, interior stylist Lucy Gough saw her income disappear when the coronavirus hit and naturally felt anxious about her future prospects.\n\"Within one week the four shoots I'd been prepping for were all cancelled,\" she recalls.\nHowever, rather than do nothing, London-based Ms Gough decided to pivot her business and create an online interior styling course after teaching a similar course at London design school Central Saint Martins.\n\"Even though I'd wanted to create a course for the last year it wasn't until lockdown was confirmed and all my income evaporated that I started creating it,\" she says.\nCovering six modules including shoot styling and home staging, Ms Gough launched the self-paced course in mid-May and within two weeks had already attracted 112 students from as far as Canada and Poland. She estimates that the course might make her £20,000 this year.\n\"It has changed my life in terms of giving me an income when all my jobs as a stylist were cancelled at the beginning of Covid-19,\" she says. \"I always envisaged my online course being a career sideline but at the moment it's my only focus. When shoots are scheduled in again it will start to become the passive income that I had imagined.\"\nMs Gough is just one of thousands of people worldwide to have created an online course following the outbreak of coronavirus. Thanks to the pandemic, e-learning platforms are experiencing an unprecedented demand as lockdown has prompted people to take courses on everything from digital marketing and life coaching, to floristry and gaming.\nEven before the coronavirus crisis, the value of the sector was forecast to jump to $300bn (£250bn) by 2025, up from $190bn in 2018, according to the research firm Global Market Insights.\nAnkur Nagpal, founder and chief executive of New York-based course-hosting platform Teachable, says lockdown has greatly accelerated the number of people starting an e-learning business.\n\"A lot of people who intended to move their courses online in the future found this to be a catalyst and adapted rapidly,\" he says.\nTotal revenue earned by course tutors on its platform has also grown significantly since the outbreak, with its teachers set to earn more than $43m in May, up from $24m in February.\nEven Mr Nagpal was surprised to see the surge in new course sales. \"I imagined there would be some form of consumer spending slowdown, but we saw the opposite.\"\nGreg Smith, founder of Vancouver-based Thinkific, which provides the software for entrepreneurs looking to create online courses, says, \"Consumption has gone up as people are stuck at home and want to learn new professional skills or take up new hobbies to entertain themselves.\"\nThe company is seeing demand for courses in areas such as mental health, home school activities for kids, and health and fitness.  \nHowever, it is not all rosy in the world of online courses.\nJonathan Little, 26, a content outreach executive living in Crewe, enrolled in a 14-day free trial of a graphic design course via Shaw Academy, an online learning platform, in May in a bid to improve his skillset.\nHowever, not happy with the course, he decided to cancel within the two-week period. He says the process was \"incredibly convoluted and damn-near impossible to cancel\".\n\"You have to log into your account and then you go through five to six different screens, each one giving you the same spiel about 'don't give in on dreams'. \n\"After all these pages you finally get through to what you think is the cancellation page then you're told you can't cancel online and instead need to call. I rang from a landline and after a lengthy automated voicemail, I cancelled. After seeing reviews online I decided to call my bank to make sure no money would go out to them.\"\nMore Technology of Business\nMr Little says it has made him think twice about signing up to online courses in the future. \"It's made me a bit more cautious. I always usually look at reviews online but I just did it in the spur of the moment. It's made me cautious about signing up to things I've not heard of before.\"\nJames Egan, chief executive of Shaw Academy, told the BBC that Mr Little encountered an automated voicemail service because he called on a Sunday, when the firm does not have people answering the phones.\n\"We apologise that the customer's cancellation process took longer than usual. We take customer feedback and satisfaction very seriously and are currently reviewing our cancellation process to see whether we can make it easier for the small number of people who choose to cancel our services.\"\nHow do other sites handle complaints about courses? Thinkific's Greg Smith says, \"If someone alerts us to a scam or fraud we will shut down sites. However, we have done that very little since we set up eight years ago.\"\nAmanda Rosewarne, co-founder and chief executive of the CPD Standards Office, which provides independent Continuing Professional Development (CPD) accreditation, says people should be cautious when taking up courses due to an increasing number of scams.\n\"One scam involves creating a site, charging you for a course, and then never delivering the product,\" she says. \"Scammers can also easily hook you by selling a course, but then once you have completed it and 'passed' the assessment, the professional certificate or licence fails to materialise in the post or by email.\"\nDespite some problems in the sector, for some, running an online course can be life-changing.\nLeila Gharani, 42, has been teaching Excel courses costing via Udemy since 2016 and takes home a six-figure salary from the e-learning platform. The lockdown has led to three times as many students as usual taking up her courses, with 10,400 bookings in April.\nThe Vienna-based course creator says teaching online has changed her \"whole life\". \nShe adds: \"I stopped consulting and I switched all my work to online except for some conferences and speaking engagements. My husband left his full-time work and joined my company. We have a lot more time for the kids and it's offered more stability in our private life as we can work from home.\"\nFor those who never want to go back to an office, online courses might be the future.",

        "title": "What went wrong with the coronavirus app?",
        "description": "After months of work, the UK has ditched the way its coronavirus-tracing app works, prompting a blame game between the government and two of the world's biggest tech firms. So what went wrong?\nAt the end of March, I got a text from a senior figure in the UK's technology industry. This person said they were helping the NHS \"on a very substantial project that will launch in days and potentially save hundreds of thousands of British lives.\"\nThat was the first I knew of the plan to build a contact tracing app, a project that soon appeared to be at the very centre of the government's strategy to beat coronavirus and help us all emerge from lockdown. \nThe tech luminary had somehow assumed that I could be an adviser to the project - I made it clear that could not be my role but I was very interested in following its progress.\nNow, nearly three months on, after missing deadline after deadline, there has been a radical change in direction. The app that has been developed so far is being scrapped, and a new approach will be tried based on a system created by Apple and Google. \nBut there is no guarantee when, if ever, this will be rolled out. So what went wrong?\nWhen the team from the NHSX digital division was assembled they were told they were engaged on a vital mission. According to a presentation the team was shown the Covid-19 app would have four aims:\nOnce installed on a user's phone, the app would use Bluetooth to keep a record of other people with whom they came into close contact - as long as they too had installed the app. Then when someone tested positive for the virus, alerts would be sent to their close contacts of recent days telling them to go into quarantine.\nThe epidemiological expertise was provided by a team of Oxford scientists who had argued that there was an urgent need to  identify people who were spreading the virus without knowing. \"Very fast contact tracing was likely to be essential,\" says one of the Oxford team, Dr David Bonsall. \"And smartphones have the technological capability to speed up that process.\"\nBut using the Bluetooth connection on smartphones to detect contacts was untested technology. Still, the team was inspired by Singapore, which had released its Trace Together app using that system.\n\n12 April\n\nHeath Secretary Matt Hancock announces the development of \"a new NHS app for contact tracing\".\n\n5 May\n\nThe app is launched on the Isle of Wight. It is downloaded by 60&comma000 people&comma under half the population of the island&comma over the following 10 days.  Mr Hancock tells BBC Breakfast that if the trial on the Isle of Wight is successful&comma the app will be rolled out nationwide by the middle of May. He also says the public would have a \"duty\" to download the app and that 60% of people in the country would have to do so for the system to function.\n\n20 May\n\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson tells Parliament: \"We will have a test&comma track and trace operation that will be world-beating and yes it will be in place by 1 June.\" He also says there will be 25&comma000 trackers who \"will be able to cope with 10&comma000 new cases a day\".\n\n27 May\n\nContact-tracing system is launched without a nationwide app. Anybody who has been in close contact with someone who has tested positive will have to self-isolate for 14 days. According to government figures&comma in the first week tracers contact 5&comma407 people with the virus.\n\n5 June\n\nBusiness Minister Nadhim Zahawi says the app tested on the Isle of Wight will \"be running as soon as we think it is robust\". Speaking on BBC Question Time&comma the minister says: \"I can't give you an exact date&comma it would be wrong for me to do so.\" Asked to confirm it would be rolled out nationwide this month&comma he says: \"I'd like to think we'd be able to manage by this month&comma yes.\"\n\n17 June\n\nLord Bethell&comma the Minister for Innovation at the Department of Health and Social Care&comma says the app \"isn’t the priority\". Answering a question about the app from the Science and Technology Committee&comma the minister says: \"We are seeking to get something going for the winter&comma but it isn't the priority for us at the moment.\" He declines to offer a launch date for the app.\n\n18 June\n\nIn a major U-turn&comma the UK ditches its version and shifts to a model based on technology provided by Apple and Google. The Apple-Google design is promoted as being more privacy-focused. However&comma it means epidemiologists will have access to less data.\nBut it soon became clear that using Bluetooth was tricky. Reports from Singapore suggested people were reluctant to download the app because it had to be kept open on the phone all the time, draining the battery.\nThen on 10 April came a surprising announcement from Google and Apple. The two tech giants - on whose software virtually all the world's smartphones depend - said they were going to develop a system that would help Bluetooth contact-tracing apps work smoothly. But there was a catch - only privacy-focused apps would be allowed to use the platform.\nApple and Google favoured decentralised apps, where the matching between infected people and their list of contacts happened between their phones. The alternative was for the matching to be done on a central computer, owned by a health authority, which would end up storing lots of very sensitive information.\nThe app the NHS was developing was based on a centralised model, which the Oxford scientists felt was vital if the health service was to be able to monitor virus outbreaks properly.\nTwo days later, with quite a fanfare, Health Secretary Matt Hancock unveiled the plans for the Covid-19 app, promising \"all data will be handled according to the highest ethical and security standards, and would only be used for NHS care and research\". \nBut immediately privacy campaigners, politicians and technology experts raised concerns. \"I recognise the overwhelming force of the public health arguments for a centralised system, but I also have 25 years' experience of the NHS being incompetent at developing systems and repeatedly breaking their privacy promises,\" said Cambridge University's Prof Ross Anderson.\nYet the project was still gathering pace with the first trial of the app at RAF Leeming, in Yorkshire. The trial was held under artificial conditions, with servicemen and women placing phones adjacent to each other on tables to see what happened.\nMeanwhile, privacy-conscious Germany became the latest country to switch its app to the decentralised model, using the Apple and Google system. It seemed that Apple had made it clear that it would not cooperate with a centralised app.\nMichael Veale, a British academic working with a consortium developing decentralised apps, warned that the NHS app was on the wrong path, asking on Twitter \"will the UK push ahead with an app that will not work on iPhones - which has devastated adoption in Singapore?\"\nBut the UK pushed ahead with a trial in the Isle of Wight. As it got underway Mr Hancock told the public they had a \"duty\" to download the app when it became available and that it would be crucial in getting \"our liberty back\" as the lockdown was eased.\nFirst sight of the app showed it was very simple, asking users whether they had a fever or a continuous cough. But any symptom alerts sent out to contacts merely echoed the standard \"stay alert\" advice - test results couldn't be entered into the app at this stage. It left many residents confused.\nStill, the fact that the app was quickly downloaded by more than half of the island's smartphone users saw the government branding the trial a success.\nMeanwhile, the Financial Times revealed that the government had hired a Swiss software developer to build a second app, using the Apple and Google technology. NHS insiders were quick to downplay the significance of this move - although one admitted \"Downing Street is getting nervous\".\nWork continued on a second, more sophisticated version of the original app, which was again going to be tested in the Isle of Wight before a national rollout - though the original deadline of mid-May had been missed.\nOn 20 May, however, it became clear that the government's focus was switching to manual-contact tracing. The prime minister announced that a \"world beating\" tracing system would be in place by the beginning of June, though Number 10 stressed that the app's contribution to the system would come a bit later.\nAs May drew to a close the boss of the wider test and trace programme, Baroness Dido Harding, said the app would be the \"cherry on the cake\" of the project. It was no longer the cake itself.\nBy early June, more deadlines for the national release of the app had come and gone. Three weeks into the Isle of Wight trial residents were getting restless, with very little information on how it was going or when an updated version of the app was coming.\nFrance launched its centralised Stop-Covid app, which had drawn heavy criticism from privacy campaigners, and digital minister Cedric O said 600,000 downloads in the first few hours was \"a good start\".\nOn 4 June, Business Minister Nadhim Zadhawi was coaxed into saying the app should be ready by the end of the month, but that was the last firm deadline that would be promised.\nSingapore, which had continued to struggle to make its contact tracing app work, announced plans to give all citizens a wearable device in the hope that this would do a better job than a smartphone.\nOn 14 June, Germany became the biggest country to launch a decentralised app on the Apple/Google platform. It quickly outstripped France in terms of downloads with something approaching 10% of the population installing it. \nBy now the silence from the UK government about the NHS app was deafening. What was going on?\nAround lunchtime on 18 June all became clear. The BBC broke the story that the government was abandoning the centralised app and moving to something based on Google and Apple's technology. Despite all the spin, the Isle of Wight trial had highlighted a disastrous flaw in the app - it failed to detect 96% of contacts with Apple iPhones.\nThe blame game has already begun. Mr Hancock and some of the scientists working with the NHS believe Apple should have been more cooperative. Technology experts and privacy campaigners say they warned months ago how this story would end.\nApple says it did not know the UK was working on a \"hybrid\" version of the NHS coronavirus contact-tracing app using tech it developed with Google.\nMeanwhile, there is scant proof from anywhere around the world that smartphone apps using Bluetooth are an effective method of contact tracing. Back in March, it seemed that the hugely powerful devices most of us carry with us might help us emerge from this health crisis. Now it looks as though a human being on the end of a phone is a far better option.",

        "title": "Have we become too reliant on Big Tech firms?",
        "description": "\"We wouldn't have survived without Amazon,\" says Keith Ingram, owner of vinyl records shop Assai Records.\nWhen lockdown hit on 23 March in the UK, Mr Ingram had to shut his shops in Edinburgh and Dundee, and sell his stock through Amazon Marketplace. Now, his sales are 40% higher than last year. \n\"Without Amazon, we would have had to furlough all employees for all of lockdown. Instead, we furloughed them for four weeks until we adjusted ourselves to the new normal, and then we could retrain staff to help us fulfil our online orders,\" he says.\nIt's not just Amazon that has been used more during the pandemic. Apple and Android smartphones and tablets, Facebook's apps and Microsoft tools have provided crucial links with friends, family and colleagues.\nAnd that's certainly been great for investors and the billionaires behind these firms. Shares in Facebook, Apple, Amazon and Microsoft all hit all-time highs on the stock market in June.\nBetween 18 March and 19 May, Amazon's Jeff Bezos saw his wealth swell by $34.6bn (£27.6bn) and Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg's wealth rose by $25bn (£19.9bn), according to a recent report.\nBut is this reliance on Big Tech getting out of control? \n\"Amazon have gone from being the dominant gatekeepers for online commerce to being the dominant gatekeeper for much of retail because of the lockdowns,\" says Stacy Mitchell, co-director of the Institute for Local Self-Reliance, the US organisation that challenges concentrated economic and political power.\nMeanwhile, this week the UK government announced that it would be using a coronavirus-tracing app based on technology from Apple and Google.\nGermany, Italy and Denmark are among other countries also using that system.\nBig Tech firms have been getting even bigger during the pandemic and their success means they have plenty of funds to snap up other businesses.\nFor example, in May Facebook announced its second biggest deal - a plan to buy a 10% stake in India's Jio, a telecoms and digital services business.\n\"All of them will be in the M&A [mergers and acquisitions] game if they're not already. Start-ups are more likely to sell out during the pandemic when they might struggle to meet their obligations and the buyout looks especially attractive - the pandemic is speeding up the buyout date in some cases,\" says Sandeep Vaheesan, legal director at the Open Markets Institute, a think-tank that studies corporate concentration.\nBefore the pandemic, there had been scrutiny on Big Tech. The US House Judiciary antitrust subcommittee sent requests for information to Amazon, Apple, Google owner Alphabet and Facebook in September 2019, with the government concerned that only a small number of companies hold such a big share of the digital market.\nCoronavirus may have delayed these investigations, but they will still be carried out.\n\"Those focused on antitrust will renew their attention on big tech companies because we're in an election year [in the US] and both parties are going to want the attention on their efforts to regulate business,\" says Jonathan Osborne, a lawyer from Globalaw's law firm Gunster. \nMr Vaheesan warns that in the US, the Department of Justice (DoJ) and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) have not taken company acquisitions seriously enough - clearing the acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp by Facebook, and YouTube by Google.\nHe is not optimistic that the DoJ and the FTC will change their approach in the future.\nIn the UK, Amazon's multi-million pound investment in Deliveroo was provisionally cleared by competition chiefs because the takeaway courier said it would collapse if it was blocked. A final ruling is due on 6 August. \n\"That was a one-off, the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) looked at the market circumstances and saw them changing because of the pandemic, but the pandemic is not a reason for Big Tech companies to get away with scrutiny - absolutely not,\" says Jonathan Branton, head of competition at law firm DWF.\nThe CMA has since announced it is investigating Facebook's acquisition of Giphy, the popular owner of a library of short animations and stickers used in social media.\nMore Technology of Business\nBut is the current level of scrutiny enough, and will it change because of the pandemic?\n\"It's hard to look into a crystal ball. I think Microsoft has taken a strong stance on trust, security and ethical use of AI, and while we've been focusing more on the crisis response in the short term, we still maintain and apply these principles and they will apply in the future. It's then about how public, industry and government look at that across the usage of Big Tech in the market,\" says Microsoft's Azure business lead Michael Wignall.\nMr Vaheesan suggests that these major investigations into tech companies may not be what they seem.\n\"It's too soon to say whether these are serious inquiries or whether they're merely a window dressing responding to the public and political concerns about the power of the big five tech companies.\"\nIn the US the picture is further complicated by President Trump's fraught relationship with Twitter.\nIn May, for the first time, the company attached fact-check links to the President's tweets.\nThat prompted a furious response from the White House with the President threatening to \"strongly regulate\" or even \"close down\" social media firms.\nFacebook has also been under pressure to remove comments made by the President, but has so far kept his posts up.\nRepublicans feel that Social Media Platforms totally silence conservatives voices. We will strongly regulate, or close them down, before we can ever allow this to happen. We saw what they attempted to do, and failed, in 2016. We can’t let a more sophisticated version of that....\nEnd of Twitter post  by @realDonaldTrump\nTo help protect their interests, the Big Tech firms have hundreds of lobbyists working in Washington.\n\"When I meet with elected representatives in Washington DC, they're almost a bit bereft that there are more lobbyists than they have staffers to write this legislation,\" says Scott Galloway, professor of marketing at NYU Stern.\n\"The budgets at DoJ and the FTC have been cut every year, so although there's more likely to be anti-trust action with a change in the White House, the question is whether the US government even has the resources anymore,\" says Mr Galloway. \nMr Galloway believes that Europe is more likely to take the lead on tougher sanctions against Big Tech than the US. \n\"Europe gets all of the downside of big tech... but they get very little of the upside. In the US, these are tremendous economic engines, providing a lot of jobs and a source of pride - they create that ecosystem of other successful companies around them,\" he says.\nThe European Commission announced two new antitrust investigations into Apple this week, while a recent Wall Street Journal report suggested that Amazon could be next on the EU's agenda, over its treatment of third party sellers.\n\"It raises the question: why are we so dependent on a handful of large companies? Would we actually lose anything as a society if we had multiple online marketplaces? There's really nothing that compels us to accept the present structure of these markets,\" says Mr Vaheesan. \nBig tech may be getting stronger during the pandemic, but it may actually make things harder for them in the long term.\nAmazon, Facebook, Apple and Alphabet were asked for a response but declined to comment.
