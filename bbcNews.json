        "title": "Beijing to set up new security office in Hong Kong",
        "description": "China's new security law for Hong Kong envisages setting up an office in the territory to gather intelligence and handle crimes against national security, state media say.\nThe new security law will also override any local laws that conflict with it, Xinhua news agency reported.\nThe planned law has sparked protests and drawn international condemnation.\nCritics say it will destroy the freedoms Hong Kong enjoys but which are not available in mainland China.\nOn Friday the European Parliament voted to take China to the International Court of Justice in The Hague if the law was imposed.\nBut China says the law is needed to tackle separatist activity, subversion, terrorism and collusion with foreign elements and rejects criticism a interference in its affairs.\nHong Kong was handed back to China from British control in 1997 under an agreement centring on a \"one country, two systems\" principle that guaranteed certain freedoms for Hong Kong and that do not apply in the mainland.\nDetails were published after a three-day meeting of the main decision-making body in China's parliament, the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress.\nA new national security office in Hong Kong would deal with national security cases, but would also have other powers such as overseeing education about national security in Hong Kong schools.\nXinhua also said that Hong Kong's leader Carrie Lam would be able to appoint specific judges to hear national security cases.\nMs Lam has backed the proposed law and has denied that Hong Kong's freedoms under the \"one country, two systems\" will be affected.\nThe Hong Kong government will be required to carry out most enforcement under the new law, but Beijing will be able to overrule the Hong Kong authorities in some cases.\n\"If the local laws... are inconsistent with this Law, the provisions of this Law shall apply. The power to interpret this law belongs to the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress,\" Xinhua said.\nThe process of creating and finalising legislation in China usually takes some years, BBC Reality Check's Wanyuan Song says, with one law for Taiwan taking five years to pass from when it was first proposed.\nBut state media says the new security law planned for Hong Kong could be published this summer, although it was proposed just a few months ago, she adds.\nBy Celia Hatton, Asia-Pacific editor, BBC News \nIn one short but powerful document, Beijing initiated the most dramatic changes to Hong Kong's power structure since the territory was handed back from Britain in 1997. \nThe new law says unequivocally that it will override any divergent legislation in Hong Kong, effectively wiping out the Chinese territory's own body of laws and regulations.\nChinese leaders contend the law will target only a handful of terrorists and separatists, but key details have yet to be released: namely, what falls under the umbrella of national security and what constitutes a crime. \nThe legislation won't be imposed without a fight: many in Hong Kong are fiercely opposed to the law, fearing it will erase their existing freedoms. And if the national security law does become a reality, Beijing faces international ramifications. \nThe US says the law means Hong Kong is no longer sufficiently autonomous to merit special treatment under US law.\nThis potentially paves the way for Hong Kong to be stripped of trading privileges, such as lower tariffs, meaning that the US would treat it the same as any other mainland Chinese city for trading purposes.\nMeanwhile the UK says it will change its immigration rules and offer millions of people in Hong Kong \"a route to citizenship\" if China imposes the new law.\nThe 1997 handover agreement between the UK and China - a mini-constitution called the Basic Law and a so-called \"one country, two systems\" principle - envisages Hong Kong rights that include freedom of assembly and speech, an independent judiciary and some democratic rights which no other part of mainland China has.\nUnder the same agreement, Hong Kong is expected to enact its own national security law - this was set out in Article 23 of the Basic Law.\nBut its unpopularity means it has never been done - the government tried in 2003 but had to back down after protests.\nThen, last year, protests over an extradition law turned violent and evolved into a broader anti-China and pro-democracy movement.\nChina doesn't want to see that happen again.",

        "title": "Trump addresses Tulsa rally amid virus fears",
        "description": "US President Donald Trump has begun addressing supporters at his first campaign rally since March, when the US coronavirus lockdown began.\nEarlier, organisers cancelled an \"overflow\" event at Tulsa's 19,000-seat Bank of Oklahoma Center when the expected crowds failed to materialise.\nThere are concerns the event could increase the spread of Covid-19. \nThose attending must sign a waiver protecting the Trump campaign from responsibility for any illness.\nHours before the rally, the campaign said six staff members involved in organising it had tested positive.\nOn Friday, Oklahoma's supreme court rejected a lawsuit asking that social distancing guidelines be followed.\nThe Trump campaign said attendees would have to pass temperature checks before being allowed into the venue - and that they would be offered face masks. \nMore than 2.2 million cases of Covid-19 and 119,000 associated deaths have been reported in the US, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.\nMr Trump's re-election campaign rally is one of the biggest indoor gatherings in the US since the country's Covid-19 outbreak began.\nThe Trump campaign said it had received more than a million ticket requests, and that the president would speak inside the BOK Center and at an outdoor stage set up nearby for overflow crowds. When the numbers failed to appear, campaign officials cancelled the outdoor appearance, blaming \"radical protesters\" and the media for attempting to \"frighten off\" supporters.\nIn his opening remarks, Mr Trump said there had been \"very bad people outside, they were doing bad things\", but did not elaborate.\nSupporters began queuing earlier this week for a chance to get into the arena, and 100,000 people or more were expected to gather in central Tulsa.\nThis week the number of new cases of Covid-19 in Oklahoma has been rising and local health officials fear the rally could become a \"super spreader\" event. \nIn a Facebook post, Tulsa Mayor GT Bynum acknowledged that Tulsa's residents were divided over it being the first city to host such an event.\n\"We do this as our positive Covid-19 cases are rising, but while our hospital capacity remains strong. Some think it is great, some think it is reckless. Regardless of where each of us falls on that spectrum, we will go through it as a community,\" he wrote.\nPolitical rallies are a source of inspiration as well as invigoration for Donald Trump. He draws energy from arenas filled with enthusiastic supporters, and uses their responses to the various riffs in his sometimes long, free-form speeches to sense what issues resonate with his loyal base.\nFor more than three months, as Covid-19 has spread across the US, the president has had to do without these emotional and strategic sounding boards. Now, the rallies are coming back, even though cases of the virus are reaching new record peaks in many states and public health officials continue to warn of the dangers of large gatherings.\nWith less than five months until election day, the president is billing this as the beginning of his re-election bid. Given that he held his official campaign kick-off in Orlando almost exactly a year ago, it perhaps is better seen as a re-boot of a campaign that has struggled to gain its footing as the nation has been beset by the pandemic and mass demonstrations against institutional racism and excessive force by police. \nThe president is now billing his campaign around the slogan \"the Great American Comeback\". Given the recent turmoil, and Mr Trump's sagging poll numbers, he is clearly hoping the Tulsa rally is the beginning of his own political revival.\nThere were also concerns among officials in Tulsa that there would be clashes between supporters and opponents of the president, but no serious trouble was reported. \nEmotions are still running high following the killing of an unarmed black man, George Floyd, by police in Minneapolis last month, which sparked widespread anti-racism protests.\nMayor Bynum declared on Thursday a curfew covering the area around the BOK Center, citing the risk of \"civil unrest\". But on Friday, Mr Trump announced that the curfew had been lifted for \"our many supporters\". \nHe also warned: \"Any protesters, anarchists, agitators, looters or lowlifes who are going to Oklahoma please understand, you will not be treated like you have been in New York, Seattle, or Minneapolis. It will be a much different scene!\"\nMr Trump had initially planned to hold the rally on Friday. But he changed the date last week after learning it fell on 19 June, known as Juneteenth, which marks the end of slavery in the US.\nThe choice of location is also controversial. In 1921, Tulsa was the scene of a race riot in which white mobs attacked black people and businesses. \nAt a peaceful Juneteenth rally in Tulsa on Friday, the civil rights activist Al Sharpton said campaigners could \"Make America Great\" for everybody for the first time.

        "title": "Trump fires top US prosecutor who refused to quit",
        "description": "US President Donald Trump has fired a top federal prosecutor who refused to leave office, Attorney General William Barr has said.\nGeoffrey Berman, the US Attorney for the Southern District of New York, said on Friday that he had learned he was \"stepping down\" in a press release.\nMr Berman insisted he would stay in post and continue his investigations.\nOn Saturday, Mr Barr told him that he had asked the president to remove him immediately, and that he had done so.\nTop US Democrat Nancy Pelosi said she believed there were \"base and improper motives\" in the sacking of Mr Berman and that the Attorney General \"must be held accountable for his actions\".\nMr Berman oversaw the prosecution of a number of Mr Trump's associates.\nThey included the president's former lawyer Michael Cohen, who has served a prison sentence for lying to Congress and election campaign finance fraud. \nMr Berman's department has also been investigating the conduct of Rudy Giuliani, Mr Trump's current personal lawyer.\nThe row between the attorney general and the top federal prosecutor in Manhattan began on Friday night, when Mr Barr issued a press release announcing that Mr Berman was \"stepping down\" after two-and-a-half years in the post.      \nMr Berman had \"done an excellent job\", achieving \"many successes on consequential civil and criminal matters\", Mr Barr said.\nHe added that the president intended to nominate Securities and Exchange Commission chairman Jay Clayton, who has never served as a federal prosecutor, as Mr Berman's successor.\nNot long afterwards, Mr Berman issued his own a statement, saying he had learned he was \"stepping down\" from the press release.\n\"I have not resigned, and have no intention of resigning, my position,\" he added. \"I will step down when a presidentially appointed nominee is confirmed by the Senate.\" \nMr Barr's announcement appeared to surprise the Republican chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Lindsey Graham.  \nHe who said that Mr Clayton's nomination would still have to be approved by New York's two Senators, Chuck Schumer and Kirsten Gillibrand, who are both Democrats.\nSenator Schumer tweeted: \"This late Friday night dismissal reeks of potential corruption of the legal process. What is angering President Trump? A previous action by this US Attorney or one that is ongoing?\" \nIn a letter to Mr Berman released by the justice department on Saturday, Mr Barr wrote that they had discussed his intention to appoint Mr Clayton as US attorney and that he had hoped for co-operation \"to facilitate a smooth transition\".\n\"Unfortunately, with your statement of last night, you have chosen public spectacle over public service. Because you have declared that you have no intention of resigning, I have asked the president to remove you as of today, and he has done so,\" he added.\nThis is unbelievable. The handling has been woeful. Just read this statement from the US Attorney General. #Berman #WilliamBarr pic.twitter.com/g5R4U3euLq\nEnd of Twitter post  by @BBCJonSopel\nMr Barr said Mr Berman's deputy, Audrey Strauss, would become the acting US attorney and that he anticipated she would serve in that capacity until a permanent successor was in place.\nLater, Mr Berman said that \"in light of Attorney General Barr's decision to respect the normal operation of law\" and to have Ms Strauss become acting US attorney, he would be leaving office, \"effective immediately\".\n\"It has been the honour of a lifetime to serve as this District's US attorney and a custodian of its proud legacy, but I could leave the district in no better hands than Audrey's.\"\n\"I know that under her leadership, this office's unparalleled AUSAs [Assistant United States Attorneys], investigators, paralegals, and staff will continue to safeguard the Southern District's enduring tradition of integrity and independence,\" he added.\nBefore leaving the White House for a campaign rally in Tulsa, President Trump told reporters that the decision to fire Mr Berman was a matter for the attorney general.\n\"That's his department, not my department. But we have a very capable attorney general, so that's really up to him. I'm not involved.\"",

        "title": "One-fifth of Earth's ocean floor is now mapped",
        "description": "We've just become a little less ignorant about Planet Earth.\nThe initiative that seeks to galvanise the creation of a full map of the ocean floor says one-fifth of this task has now been completed.\nWhen the Nippon Foundation-GEBCO Seabed 2030 Project was launched in 2016, only 6% of the global ocean bottom had been surveyed to what might be called modern standards.\nThat number now stands at 19%, up from 16% in just the last year.\nSome 14.5 million sq km of new bathymetric (depth) data was included in the GEBCO grid in 2019 - an area equivalent to almost twice that of Australia.\nIt does, however, still leave a great swathe of the planet unmapped to an acceptable degree.\n\"Today we stand at the 19% level. That means we've got another 81% of the oceans still to survey, still to map. That's an area about twice the size of Mars that we have to capture in the next decade,\" project director Jamie McMichael-Phillips told BBC News.\nThe map at the top of this page illustrates the challenge faced by GEBCO in the coming years. \nBlack represents those areas where we have yet to get direct echosounding measurements of the shape of the ocean floor. Blues correspond to water depth (deeper is purple, shallower is lighter blue). \nIt's not true to say we have no idea of what's in the black zones; satellites have actually taught us a great deal. Certain spacecraft carry altimeter instruments that can infer seafloor topography from the way its gravity sculpts the water surface above - but this only gives a best resolution at over a kilometre, and Seabed 2030 has a desire for a resolution of at least 100m everywhere.\nBetter seafloor maps are needed for a host of reasons.\nThey are essential for navigation, of course, and for laying underwater cables and pipelines.\nThey are also important for fisheries management and conservation, because it is around the underwater mountains that wildlife tends to congregate. Each seamount is a biodiversity hotspot.\nIn addition, the rugged seafloor influences the behaviour of ocean currents and the vertical mixing of water.\nThis is information required to improve the models that forecast future climate change - because it is the oceans that play a critical role in moving heat around the planet. And if you want to understand precisely how sea-levels will rise in different parts  of the world, good ocean-floor maps are a must.\nMuch of the data that's been imported into the GEBCO grid recently has been in existence for some time but was \"sitting on a shelf\" out of the public domain. The companies, institutions and governments that were holding this information have now handed it over - and there is probably a lot more of this hidden resource still to be released.\nBut new acquisitions will also be required. Some of these will come from a great crowdsourcing effort - from ships, big and small, routinely operating their echo-sounding equipment as they transit the globe. Even small vessels - fishing boats and yachts - can play their part by attaching data-loggers to their sonar and navigation equipment. \nOne very effective strategy is evidenced by the British Antarctic Survey (BAS), which operates in the more remote parts of the globe - and that is simply to mix up the routes taken by ships.\n\"Very early on we adopted the ethos that data should be collected on passage - on the way to where we were going, not just at the site of interest,\" explained BAS scientist Dr Rob Larter. \n\"A beautiful example of this is the recent bathymetric map of the Drake Passage area (between South America and Antarctica). A lot of that was acquired by different research projects as they fanned out and moved back and forth to the places they were going.\"\nNew technology will be absolutely central to the GEBCO quest. \nOcean Infinity, a prominent UK-US company that conducts seafloor surveys, is currently building a fleet of robotic surface vessels through a subsidiary it calls Armada. This start-up's MD, Dan Hook, says low-cost, uncrewed vehicles may be the only way to close some of the gaps in the more out-of-the-way locations in the 2030 grid.\nHe told BBC News: \"When you look at the the mapping of the seabed in areas closer to shore, you see the business case very quickly. Whether it's for wind farms or cable-laying - there are lots of people that want to know what's down there. But when it's those very remote areas of the planet, the case then is really only a scientific one.\"    \nJamie McMichael-Phillips is confident his project's target can be met if everyone pulls together.\n\"I am confident, but to do it we will need partnerships. We need governments, we need industry, we need academics, we need philanthropists, and we need citizen scientists. We need all these individuals to come together if we're to deliver an ocean map that is absolutely fundamental and essential to humankind.\"\nGEBCO stands for General Bathymetric Chart of the Oceans. It is the only intergovernmental organisation with a mandate to map the entire ocean floor. The latest status of its Seabed 2030 project was announced to coincide with World Hydrography Day.\nJonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter: @BBCAmos",

        "title": "Border clash a 'deliberate provocation' - China",
        "description": "China has accused Indian troops of a \"deliberate provocation\" in its first official comments on Monday's deadly clash at a disputed Himalayan border.\nForeign ministry spokesman Lijian Zhao said the troops had crossed into Chinese territory and attacked, triggering \"fierce physical conflicts\".\nHowever he did not give details of any Chinese casualties.\nOn Friday Indian PM Narendra Modi said no foreign soldiers had crossed India's borders and no territory had been lost.\nMr Modi vowed that India would defend its border with military force if necessary.\nTwenty Indian soldiers were killed in the clash in the Galwan Valley. India has said that both sides suffered losses during the fighting.\nIn a series of tweets, Mr Zhao said the Galwan Valley was on the Chinese side of the Line of Actual Control (LAC), the poorly demarcated border between the two nuclear-armed powers.\nHe said the clash occurred at a time when tension had been easing after India demolished infrastructure it had built on the Chinese side of the LAC in May and withdrew personnel, following an agreement between Chinese and Indian officers.\nBut on 15 June Indian troops \"once again crossed the Line of Actual Control for deliberate provocation when the situation in the Galwan Valley was already easing\", Mr Zhao said.\n\"India's front-line troops even violently attacked the Chinese officers and soldiers who went there for negotiation, thus triggering fierce physical conflicts and causing casualties,\" he said.\nIndia has been building \"roads, bridges and other facilities\" at the LAC in Galwan Valley since April, Mr Zhao said.\nIn a televised statement on Friday, Mr Modi said there had been no incursion into Indian territory.\n\"Nobody has intruded into our border, neither is anybody there now, nor have our posts been captured,\" he said.\nIndia's armed forces had been \"given a free hand to take all necessary steps\" to protect Indian territory, he added. \n\"The entire country is hurt and angry at the steps taken by China,\" he said, adding: \"India wants peace and friendship, but upholding sovereignty is foremost.\"\nHis government had previously blamed China for the clash, with the foreign ministry releasing a statement on Wednesday saying it had been sparked after \"the Chinese side sought to erect a structure in Galwan valley on our side of the LAC\".\nMedia reports said troops clashed on ridges at a height of nearly 4,300m (14,000 ft) on steep terrain, with some soldiers falling into the fast-flowing Galwan river in sub-zero temperatures.\nAt least 76 Indian soldiers were reportedly injured in addition to the 20 dead. China has not released any information about Chinese casualties.\nThe fighting took place without any firearms because of a 1996 agreement barring guns and explosives from the area. \nAn image that emerged on Thursday purportedly showed some of the crude weapons used in the fight. \nThe photograph, which appears to show iron rods studded with nails, was passed to the BBC by a senior Indian military official on the India-China border, who said the weapons had been used by the Chinese.\nThe image was widely shared on Twitter in India, prompting outrage from many social media users. Neither Chinese or Indian officials have commented on it.\nThe Galwan river valley in Ladakh, with its harsh climate and high-altitude terrain, is close to Aksai Chin, a disputed area claimed by India but controlled by China.\nThis is not the first time the two nuclear-armed neighbours have fought without conventional firearms on the border. India and China have a history of face-offs and overlapping territorial claims along the more than 3,440km (2,100 mile), poorly drawn LAC separating the two sides.\nThe last firing on the border happened in 1975 when four Indian soldiers were killed in a remote pass in the north-eastern state of Arunachal Pradesh. The clash was variously described by former diplomats as an ambush and an accident. But no bullets have been fired since.\nAt the root of this is a 1996 bilateral agreement that says \"neither side shall open fire... conduct blast operations or hunt with guns or explosives within two kilometres of the Line of Actual Control\".\nBut there have been other tense confrontations along the border in recent weeks. In May Indian and Chinese soldiers exchanged physical blows on the border at Pangong Lake, also in Ladakh, and in the north-eastern Indian state of Sikkim hundreds of miles to the east.\nIndia has accused China of sending thousands of troops into the Galwan Valley and says China occupies 38,000 sq km (14,700 sq miles) of its territory. Several rounds of talks in the last three decades have failed to resolve the boundary disputes.",

        "description": "A far-left party in Germany has erected a controversial statue of communist leader Vladimir Lenin.\nThe tiny Marxist-Leninist Party of Germany (MLPD) installed the statue in front of its headquarters in the western city of Gelsenkirchen.\nCity authorities had attempted to stop the statue being installed and launched an online hashtag saying there was \"no place for Lenin\".\nBut courts blocked their appeals and the unveiling went ahead on Saturday.\nLenin was a leader of the 1917 Russian Revolution and led the country until his death in 1924, when he was succeeded by Josef Stalin. However, he has remained a symbol of communism rule across the world, both among supporters and those who remember the human rights abuses that took place under the USSR.\nGermany itself was divided for decades between the West and the communist East, until the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989.\nIn the debate surrounding the Gelsenkirchen statue, which was made in Czechoslovakia, as it was then known, in 1957, both sides drew parallels to the tearing down of monuments linked to slavery which has taken place in anti-racism protests across the world in recent weeks.\n\"We live in a time in which many countries of the world are reflecting on memorials,\" said mayor Frank Baranowski in one of a series of YouTube videos posted by the city council against the statue.\n\"It's hard to put up with the fact that a dictator from the 21st Century is being placed on a pedestal and a memorial is being made out of it. Unfortunately the courts have decided otherwise, we must accept that, but not without comment.\"\nHowever, MLPD's chair, Gabi Fechtner, described the communist leader as \"an ahead-of-his-time thinker of world-historical importance, an early fighter for freedom and democracy\", according to the AFP news agency.",

        "description": "A US judge has rejected a request by President Donald Trump to stop the publication of a memoir by his former National Security Adviser, John Bolton.\nThe justice department argued that the book had not been properly vetted. \nWashington DC District Court Judge Royce Lamberth said the government had \"failed to establish that an injunction would prevent irreparable harm\".\nMr Bolton had \"gambled\" with US national security and  already \"exposed his country to harm\", the judge said.\nHundreds of thousands of copies of the book - The Room Where It Happened - have been printed and distributed, and are due to go on sale on Tuesday. \nIn the memoir Mr Bolton paints an unflattering picture of a president whose decision-making was dominated by a desire to be re-elected in November.\nMr Trump has said the book is \"made up of lies and fake stories\".\nThe justice department's lawyers argued that Mr Bolton had breached an obligation to complete a pre-publication review of his manuscript to ensure that it contained no classified information.\nMr Bolton's lawyers dismissed the claim. They insisted that the manuscript was thoroughly examined and that Mr Trump simply did not like the contents.\nIn his 10-page ruling, Judge Lamberth wrote that Mr Bolton had opted out of the pre-publication review process before its conclusion and that he \"likely jeopardized national security by disclosing classified information in violation of his non-disclosure agreement obligations\".\nHe nevertheless denied the government's injunction request.\n\"In taking it upon himself to publish his book without securing final approval from national intelligence authorities, Bolton may indeed have caused the country irreparable harm,\" he wrote. \n\"But in the internet age, even a handful of copies in circulation could irrevocably destroy confidentiality. A single dedicated individual with a book in hand could publish its contents far and wide from his local coffee shop. With hundreds of thousands of copies around the globe - many in newsrooms - the damage is done. There is no restoring the status quo.\"\nShortly after the decision, Mr Trump alleged on Twitter that Mr Bolton \"broke the law by releasing Classified Information (in massive amounts)\".\n\"He must pay a very big price for this, as others have before him. This should never to happen again!!!\" the president added. \nLater, the president called the ruling a \"BIG COURT WIN against Bolton\". \nBIG COURT WIN against Bolton. Obviously, with the book already given out and leaked to many people and the media, nothing the highly respected Judge could have done about stopping it...BUT, strong & powerful statements & rulings on MONEY & on BREAKING CLASSIFICATION were made....\nEnd of Twitter post  by @realDonaldTrump\nA lawyer for Mr Bolton, Charles Cooper, welcomed the judge's decision to deny the injunction request.\nHowever, he took issue with the conclusion that his client did not comply fully with his contractual pre-publication obligation to the government.\n\"The full story of these events has yet to be told - but it will be,\" he added.\nMr Bolton's publisher, Simon & Schuster, said: \"We are grateful that the Court has vindicated the strong First Amendment protections against censorship and prior restraint of publication.\"\nMr Bolton became Mr Trump's national security adviser in April 2018.\nHe left his post in September 2019, after disagreeing strongly with the president over how to handle major challenges like Iran, North Korea and Afghanistan.\nIn The Room Where It Happened, Mr Bolton portrays Mr Trump as an \"erratic\", \"impulsive\" and \"stunningly uninformed\" leader. \nAmong the allegations, which are based on private conversations and are impossible to verify, are that:",

        "title": "Judge rejects Trump bid to ban ex-adviser's book",
        "description": "A US judge has rejected a request by President Donald Trump to stop the publication of a memoir by his former National Security Adviser, John Bolton.\nThe justice department argued that the book had not been properly vetted. \nWashington DC District Court Judge Royce Lamberth said the government had \"failed to establish that an injunction would prevent irreparable harm\".\nMr Bolton had \"gambled\" with US national security and  already \"exposed his country to harm\", the judge said.\nHundreds of thousands of copies of the book - The Room Where It Happened - have been printed and distributed, and are due to go on sale on Tuesday. \nIn the memoir Mr Bolton paints an unflattering picture of a president whose decision-making was dominated by a desire to be re-elected in November.\nMr Trump has said the book is \"made up of lies and fake stories\".\nThe justice department's lawyers argued that Mr Bolton had breached an obligation to complete a pre-publication review of his manuscript to ensure that it contained no classified information.\nMr Bolton's lawyers dismissed the claim. They insisted that the manuscript was thoroughly examined and that Mr Trump simply did not like the contents.\nIn his 10-page ruling, Judge Lamberth wrote that Mr Bolton had opted out of the pre-publication review process before its conclusion and that he \"likely jeopardized national security by disclosing classified information in violation of his non-disclosure agreement obligations\".\nHe nevertheless denied the government's injunction request.\n\"In taking it upon himself to publish his book without securing final approval from national intelligence authorities, Bolton may indeed have caused the country irreparable harm,\" he wrote. \n\"But in the internet age, even a handful of copies in circulation could irrevocably destroy confidentiality. A single dedicated individual with a book in hand could publish its contents far and wide from his local coffee shop. With hundreds of thousands of copies around the globe - many in newsrooms - the damage is done. There is no restoring the status quo.\"\nShortly after the decision, Mr Trump alleged on Twitter that Mr Bolton \"broke the law by releasing Classified Information (in massive amounts)\".\n\"He must pay a very big price for this, as others have before him. This should never to happen again!!!\" the president added. \nLater, the president called the ruling a \"BIG COURT WIN against Bolton\". \nA lawyer for Mr Bolton, Charles Cooper, welcomed the judge's decision to deny the injunction request.\nHowever, he took issue with the conclusion that his client did not comply fully with his contractual pre-publication obligation to the government.\n\"The full story of these events has yet to be told - but it will be,\" he added.\nMr Bolton's publisher, Simon & Schuster, said: \"We are grateful that the Court has vindicated the strong First Amendment protections against censorship and prior restraint of publication.\"\nMr Bolton became Mr Trump's national security adviser in April 2018.\nHe left his post in September 2019, after disagreeing strongly with the president over how to handle major challenges like Iran, North Korea and Afghanistan.\nIn The Room Where It Happened, Mr Bolton portrays Mr Trump as an \"erratic\", \"impulsive\" and \"stunningly uninformed\" leader. \nAmong the allegations, which are based on private conversations and are impossible to verify, are that:",

        "title": "X Factor star reveals 'heartbreaking' racism",
        "description": "Singer Alexandra Burke has spoken out about her experiences of racism in the music industry, revealing she was asked to bleach her skin \"to look whiter\".\nAfter winning X Factor, Burke said she was told she would \"have to work 10 times harder than a white artist, because of the colour of your skin\".\nIn a 15-minute Instagram video, she recalls being told: \"You can't have braids, you can't have an afro.\n\"You have to have hair... that appeals to white people.\"\nThe 31-year-old star, who won the TV talent show in 2008 at the age of 19, described the experiences as \"heartbreaking\".\nBurke, who refused to bleach her skin, said she was inspired to tell her story by fellow X Factor contestant Misha B, who recently spoke out about \"being devalued\" at the hands of the music industry.\nMisha B claimed the X Factor projected \"this angry black girl narrative\", using words such as \"feisty\" and \"bully\" to describe her after one a live performance on the show. The 2011 contestant said it left her feeling suicidal.\n\"I could have spoken up much earlier, but was too scared to,\" said Burke, whose Instagram post has attracted a lot of attention, and sympathy, on social media.\nThe music star revealed the micro-aggressions she experienced at the hands of record labels, being told regularly that she \"comes across aggressive\".\nShe said she was told: \"You can't release this kind of music, because white people don't understand that\", and added: \"I am so upset with myself that I allowed that.\" \nBurke, whose hit singles Hallelujah, Bad Boys and All Night Long were all nominated for Brit Awards, also played the lead in the critically acclaimed West End musical The Bodyguard.\nThe singer said was told: \"Because you're a black girl, you won't make it that far in the industry... if you were white, you would be bigger than what you are now, you could sell more records, you'd be a Brit Award-winner\".\n\"It's hurtful,\" she added.\nShe was raised in north London by her mother, Soul II Soul singer Melissa Bell, who died in August 2017 - just before Burke was due to take part in Strictly Come Dancing.\nShe recalled how one journalist accused her of \"being a diva\" when she asked not to do any publicity on the show's red carpet, which happened to be taking place on the same day as her mother died.\n\"That was the image they had of me, because of the papers.\" she said. \"I was so scared on that show. So many trolls, telling me all kinds of stuff. \n\"I have no idea how I got through it. I don't even like thinking about that experience. It's simply because of me being a black, strong woman. \n\"I can speak up for myself because that's how I've been taught. But I would never do it in a way that offends people or hurts anyone.\"\nShe said the Black Lives Matter movement had persuaded her to share her experiences because \"the truth is all we've got\".\n\"I just feel like people need to not see colour,\" said Burke. \"My mum always raised me to never see colour. I will continue that way because that's what makes me happy. \n\"People are people. We are all human, we all have feelings. So be kind.\"",

        "title": "Son repeats father's historic ocean dive",
        "description": "It used to be said that more people had walked on the surface of the Moon than had dived to the deepest part of Earth's oceans. Not anymore.\nKelly Walsh, the son of the great ocean explorer Don Walsh, has just descended to the bottom of the Mariana Trench, almost 11km down in the Pacific. \nHe made the dive 60 years after his father created history in doing so.\nIt means Kelly is the 12th person to visit the trench floor - the same as the number of Apollo moonwalkers.\nThe 12-hour dive on Saturday saw him reach a depth of approximately 10,925m.\nKelly described it as \"a hugely emotional journey\" after returning to the surface.\nThe descent was piloted by the financier and adventurer Victor Vescovo. The Texan is conducting a series of dives into the lowest point of the Mariana Trench known as the Challenger Deep. \nMr Vescovo has acquired a support ship and human-rated submersible that he is using to survey several of the most extreme places on the ocean floor.\nRecent passengers who've gone down with him to the Challenger Deep include the first women to make the journey - the former Nasa astronaut Kathy Sullivan and the British-American mountaineer Vanessa O'Brien.\nBut Kelly Walsh's descent is particularly noteworthy because of his father, Don. On 23 January, 1960, the then US Navy officer, accompanied by Swiss national Jacques Piccard, made the first crewed dive to the floor of Earth's deepest ocean trench using the bathyscaphe Trieste.\nIt was an astonishing achievement given the precarious nature of the expedition. The trench is so deep, it would be possible to fit Mount Everest (8,848m) inside it and still have more than 2km of water above the peak. The pressure at the trench floor is crushing - some 100 million pascals, almost 16,000 pounds per square inch.\nSixty years on, modern technology means Victor Vescovo can reliably make very safe, repeat dives, so much so that he himself has now been down seven times in his submersible, the 12-tonne Deep Sea Vehicle (DSV) Limiting Factor.\nOn Saturday, Vescovo and Walsh spent fours hours at the bottom of what's called the \"western pool\" - one of three distinct zones in the Challenger Deep. It's the same pool that Don Walsh and Piccard visited, and the latest dive marked the first time anyone had been back since.\nThe Scottish marine biologist Alan Jamieson is one of the 12 who've made the dive to the bottom of the Mariana Trench. He went with Mr Vescovo to a slightly shallower (10,700m) location just to the east of Challenger Deep known as the Sirena Deep.\nOf Kelly Walsh's dive, he said: \"It's a commemoration of what his father did. It's also a kind of demonstration that we haven't lost that capability. People often ask why we don't seem able at the moment to go to the Moon having done it in the 60s and 70s. Likewise, with the deep ocean, Don Walsh went to the bottom of the Mariana Trench and then for several decades we didn't go anymore. But now we're showing we can do it again, and we're doing it loads.\"\nDr Jamieson is in the process of joining up with Mr Vescovo's expedition. There's a plan to take the DSV Limiting Factor shortly to the Philippine Trench, which in terms of depth at 10,500m is third only to the Mariana and Tonga trenches. \nBut it's a highly significant location in the history of ocean exploration, explained Dr Jon Copley from the University of Southampton.\nIt's where the Danish Galathea expedition in 1951 trawled animals from more than 10km down. It was the first proof that higher animals could live deeper than 10,000m, he told BBC News. \nVictor Vescovo's exploits can be followed on the website of Caladan Oceanic, which has organised the venture with Triton Submarines, who developed the Limiting Factor, and EYOS Expeditions.\nDr Copley keeps a history of ocean exploration on his blog.\nSource: Dr Jon Copley @expeditionlog\nJonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter: @BBCAmos",

        "title": "'Cashpoint aid' and Africa: Who benefits?",
        "description": "Across Africa the news that a former colonial power, the UK, is to take a more strategic, political, hard-nosed approach to the way it spends its overseas aid budget, has been greeted with a mixture of frustration and cynicism.\nIn announcing a merger between the Foreign Office (FCO) and the Department of International Development (DfID), Prime Minister Boris Johnson argued that the UK should be directing more attention and money towards countering Russian influence in nearby eastern Europe, and, by implication, spending less money in distant former colonies like Zambia and Tanzania where \"for too long British overseas aid has been treated as some giant cashpoint in the sky\".\nIn Ghana, the head of the West African Civil Society Institute, Nana Afadzinu, criticised the British move as part of a broader trend of Western countries becoming \"more myopic and inward-looking.\" \nShe said Covid-19 had exacerbated the trend, as had Brexit.\n\"Building international solidarity, supporting issues like human rights and an international development system - these are not going to be important [for foreign donors] any more,\" she said.\n\"The challenge for us, for African leaders, is to unite, to stand as one.\"\nThe link with Brexit, and Britain's search for a new global role outside the European Union, appears clear. \nSupporting the merger of the FCO and DfID, the UK's former Foreign Secretary, Jeremy Hunt, spoke of the need for London to have a stronger voice on the African continent in order to counter Chinese influence.\n\"In Africa today, there is competition - intense competition - between countries such as China that do not promote democracy and human rights as part of their aid agenda, and countries such as Britain that do,\" he said.\n\"And if we are going to support those British values, we need to speak with one voice.\"\nBut the notion of Africa as battleground for competing outside influences has a long and troubled history on the continent  - from the 19th Century colonial \"scramble for Africa\", through the Cold War's proxy conflicts, to the US and China's growing rivalry, and even today's struggle to access Covid-19 medicine. \nMany involved in the aid and development world argue that the UK, like other former colonial powers, still owes the continent a huge debt for the wealth it extracted - and continues to extract in the form of African doctors and nurses, for instance, who are encouraged to emigrate to the West.\nIndeed, one insider angrily complained that it was Africa which was still treated like a \"cashpoint\" by the West, rather than the other way round.\nIn Kenya, Degan Ali, who runs the non-governmental organisation Adeso, said Britain's announcement simply revealed what had always been the case - that foreign aid has always been part of a Western-run global system that perpetuates patterns of inequality and poverty.\n\"I think in many ways aid policies have always been dictated by foreign policy, especially in former colonies,\" she said.\n\"I think the whole [British] merger is just a confirmation - making official what has been unofficial. This is all part of the same humanitarian and development architecture that perpetuates structures of inequality.\"\nBut in recent years, DfID has earned a strong reputation across much of Africa as one of the best - if not the best - development agencies of its kind, and a loud and important voice in steering aid money away from corrupt or ineffectual governments and deals.\n\"Why would you take away a Rolls Royce and replace it with a Vauxhall Astra?\" asked another regional expert with close knowledge of DfID, who asked not to be identified, but who shared the widespread concern that the changes might damage, rather than strengthen, the UK's global influence and reputation.\n\"By weakening [DfID's] voice in strategic discussions you'll see quicker decisions, but of poorer quality,\" the expert warned.\n\"It's a significant loss of [British] soft power and DfID will lose a lot of technical competence and transparency.\"\nA departmental reshuffle in far-away Britain in the middle of a global pandemic might seem like a relatively trivial event - and indeed there are plenty of people who argue that the merger may prove successful, and point to other Western nations like Canada which have already done something similar.\nOthers say that decades of Western development aid have proved spectacularly ineffective in addressing poverty and that what Africa really needs - and many point to tiny Rwanda as a leading example - is a determination to wean itself off all-too-addictive Western aid altogether.\n\"There's always been a scramble for Africa, an attempt to partition Africa, and now we have China playing a huge role too,\" says Ms Afadzinu in Ghana.\n\"And I don't think Africans are blind to it. We need to be bold enough to take a stance against Western power and influence. \n\"But unfortunately there's always a divide between francophone and anglophone Africa. \n\"There's always this insidious work being done to make sure those fault lines are deepened. We are pawns in the hands of these different global powers and our leaders have not risen up to the challenge.\"",

        "title": "'My best friend was killed in the protests'",
        "description": "\"My best friend had a big heart,\" Diamond Davis says.\nWhen the 19-year-old from Omaha, Nebraska, lost the job she had in school, her friend James Scurlock was there for her. \nJames's family let her move in with them, meaning she avoided becoming homeless.\n\"When his family took me in, I knew that he was going to be more than just a friend to me,\" Diamond tells Radio 1 Newsbeat. \"I knew he would be like a brother.\"\nDiamond, and James, who was 22, were neighbours. \nThey met by the swimming pool of their apartment complex in 2018. \nJames would walk her to her job and help her with homework. She still has the sketches he made in the margins of her school books. \nDiamond says James, who was nicknamed \"Juju\", was silly and adored by his little brothers and sisters. \nHe had a job as a construction worker, but stopped working to focus on looking after his seven-month old daughter. He was proud to be a father, Diamond says.\nIt was thinking of his baby daughter's future that made James more politically active, according to news reports. \nHe started attending the Black Lives Matter protests following the death of George Floyd, who was killed in Minneapolis after a white police officer knelt on his neck for nearly nine minutes.\nBut after one protest on May 30, James didn't come home. \nJacob Gardner, a white bar owner, shot and killed him in an incident that was caught on video and went viral on Twitter.\nMr Gardner had been standing outside his bar to guard it and the video shows James clinging to Mr Gardner's back as he fired two shots into the air, then one shot behind his back, which hit James in the collarbone. James died from his injuries.\nThe county attorney said he wouldn't press charges as he had concluded the bar owner was acting in self-defence.\nBut some eyewitnesses claim Mr Gardner and his father were threatening protesters and using racial slurs, and James was trying to protect others.\nA public backlash led the county attorney to call in a grand jury - a group of citizens who decide if charges should be brought - to investigate the case. They will consider if Mr Gardner should face charges that could include manslaughter and carrying a weapon when his permit had expired.\nOmaha is Nebraska's largest city. It's mainly white - 77% in the last census.\nNebraskan Governor Pete Ricketts came under fire for addressing black community leaders there as \"you people\" during a meeting about James' death, causing some to walk out in protest.\nDiamond wasn't there the night her friend died. She hadn't been to the protests at all before that.\nShe says she knew police violence was a problem but she didn't think of herself as politically engaged.\nThat changed when James was killed. \"I loved James like a brother,\" she says. \"Losing him was a different kind of pain I never felt before.\"\nSo Diamond broke Covid-19 quarantine guidelines to protest with her friends. \"The government is against its own people,\" she says. \"But if the people stick together, then we can make a change in the government.\"\n\"I'm still out here protesting,\" she tells Newsbeat. \"My best friend has not got his justice yet.\"  \nJames' death is one of at least 19 in the US connected to the protests. Most were unarmed black men like him. Some died from gunshot wounds; one died when a counter-protester drove a vehicle through a crowd. \nDiamond wants other young people to support Black Lives Matter and says it's important the protests are peaceful. \n\"I believe that regardless of our situation, we shouldn't be ruining our own home,\" she says. \"I want people to be safe doing it the right way: with non-violence.\"\nDiamond spoke to Newsbeat as she prepared for a party with James's family, to commemorate him - a \"Juju world\" party with a poolside barbeque and a video montage. They hope it will be a tradition for years to come.\nDiamond hopes that charges will be brought in his case: \"I want justice for all.\"\nJames had plans for his future. He was thinking of becoming a tattoo artist like his brother, or studying in college to be a role model for his daughter.\nIn the days after his death, his name trended on Twitter. Murals have been put up to honour him.\n\"He used to tell me that when he died, he was going to die a legend,\" Diamond says of her friend, who was also an aspiring rapper. \nHe wanted to be famous, and a role model for his daughter. \"Now my best friend is a legend,\" Diamond says.\n\"His name will live on.\"\nFollow Newsbeat on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter and YouTube.\nListen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 weekdays - or listen back here.",

        "title": "Five reasons why coronavirus is so bad in Yemen",
        "description": "Coronavirus could spread faster, wider and with deadlier consequences in Yemen than many other countries in the world, the UN says. Here's five reasons why.\nSince 2015, Yemen has been devastated by conflict, leaving millions of people without access to proper health care, clean water or sanitation - crucial for preventing the virus from spreading.\nVital food, medical and humanitarian supplies have been restricted by a partial land, sea and air blockade put in place by a Saudi-led coalition of countries fighting Houthi rebels - while the rebels themselves have obstructed the distribution of aid.\nNot having a central government in charge (rebels drove the government out of the capital and into the south of the country) makes coronavirus harder to contain.\nConditions in Yemen put the population at particular risk to a highly contagious disease.\nAlmost three years before the advent of Covid-19, the UN declared Yemen the most needy place on Earth. Some 24 million people there - that's about 80% of the population - depend on aid to survive, and millions are on the brink of starvation. \nAn estimated 2 million children are acutely malnourished, and the country was already struggling to cope with diseases such as dengue fever, malaria and cholera before the first cases of coronavirus were reported. \nWeakened immune systems mean those suffering from chronic illnesses could contract Covid-19 more easily, and find it harder to survive.\nFive years of war has shattered the country's health system, leaving it incapable of coping with a pandemic. \nMany of Yemen's 3,500 medical facilities have been damaged or destroyed in air strikes, and only half are thought to be fully functioning. \nClinics are reported to be crowded, and basic medicines and equipment are lacking - in a country of 27.5 million people there are only a few hundred ventilator machines, which are used to help patients breathe in cases where coronavirus leads to lung failure. \nWithout knowing more accurately who has got coronavirus, it is more difficult to prevent its spread or plan for numbers of patients putting additional strain on the already fragile health system.\nSince the first coronavirus patient was reported in government-held areas in April, the true scale of the outbreak has been impossible to determine. \nThe government has declared just over 900 cases, while rebels who control the capital and other densely populated areas say they have detected only four cases in their territory. \nThe UN says that with testing kits in short supply and a lack of transparency in data from the rebels and the government, the actual number of cases are almost certainly much higher across the board. \nAlongside a lack of medicine to treat cases, medics in Yemen lack personal protection equipment (PPE), such as masks and gowns, to shield them from the disease. \n An unconfirmed report on privately owned Al-Masdar news website said dozens of medics had died as a result of Covid-19 in both rebel- and government-held areas. \nOne of the most prominent infectious disease experts in Yemen, Yassin Abdul Wareth, died from Covid-19 earlier this month, in what was described as a major blow to Yemen's health sector.",

        "description": "The news in the US has been dominated by anti-racism protests for the past couple of weeks, but coronavirus is now back in the headlines.\nSeveral states have seen a record number of cases in recent days, leading to fears that the country is experiencing a second wave of infections. \nBut Vice-President Mike Pence said those fears were \"overblown\" and accused the media of using \"grim predictions\" to scare the American people. \nSo what is going on in the US?\nWith more than two million coronavirus cases, the US has the highest number of confirmed infections in the world - about a quarter of the global total. \nThe situation got really bad in late March but by May, cases were declining and most states had begun to ease restrictions put into place to halt the spread of the virus. \nThe number of new cases rarely fell below 20,000 though, because as some states were bringing their outbreaks under control, others were only just beginning to see flare-ups.\nFor this reason, the top US health official for infectious diseases, Anthony Fauci, sees the current situation as a continuation of the initial outbreaks. \n\"People keep talking about a second wave,\" he told a reporter last week. \"We're still in a first wave.\"\nSpikes in cases in those new hotspots mean the country's overall seven-day average has now risen for several days in a row for the first time since cases peaked in early April. \nThe North East has been by far the worst-hit region, with about a quarter of all US cases and more than a third of all US deaths occurring in the states of New York and New Jersey. But in recent weeks, the region has brought its outbreaks under control. \nThe South and West of the country, on the other hand, have seen a big rise in the number of infections, according to data compiled by the COVID Tracking Project.  \nThere's no debate over whether cases are going up again, but there is over why. \nPresident Donald Trump blames it on increased testing, telling the Wall Street Journal he thinks \"testing is overrated\" because \"in many ways, it makes us look bad.\"\nThe US has conducted more tests than any other country - about 25 million so far - so that does go some way to explaining why it has the highest number of cases in the world, although international comparisons are difficult to make for a number of reasons.\nBut there's plenty of evidence to suggest the recent rise in infections is down to more than just a higher number of people being tested. \nTwice last week, Arizona saw more new cases on its own than the entire nine-state North East region and that's not just down to increased testing. \nThis is clear when you look at the rate of coronavirus tests that are coming back positive. \nIf lots of tests are being done and the spread of the virus has been reduced, then the positive case rate would go down too. If the virus is still being spread widely, it goes up. \nAt the moment the positive case rate is just below 5% nationally, which is the level the World Health Organization recommends countries be at or below for 14 days before they ease restrictions on movement. \nBut about a third of states are above that level, as the chart below shows, and all of them have reopened to some extent over the last month. \nThe number of people being hospitalised has also risen in a number of these states, including Texas, where some reopened bars and restaurants are now closing their doors again, reports the Texas Tribune, because of fears over a new surge of cases.\nFaced with rising case numbers and an economy that desperately needs to get going again, many public officials are looking to facemasks to help slow the spread of the virus. California, North Carolina and several US cities mandated or urged their use last week.\nBut masks have become increasingly politicised in recent weeks, with President Trump saying some people wear them primarily to show opposition to him. \nAmid all of the fears about new hotspots, the most positive news in the US at the moment is that daily deaths continue to fall.\nThey peaked back in May when the outbreaks in the Northeast were at their most intense, with New York state alone registering around 1,000 a day. This week, that figure is about 40 a day.\nHowever, deaths is a metric that lags behind cases and hospitalisations because it can take several weeks for those who are worst-hit to die from the disease. That means the consequences of the current spikes in cases won't be seen for a couple of weeks at least. \nIf we do see the number of deaths edging up, there will likely be some pressure on governors to reintroduce restrictions but Dr Fauci doesn't think that will happen. \n\"I don't think we're going to be talking about going back to lockdown,\" he said last week. \"I think we're going to be talking about trying to better control those areas of the country that seem to be having a surge of cases.\"\nResearchers are racing to produce a vaccine but it's clear that Americans, and the rest of the world, are going to be living with the virus until next year at the earliest. \nSo far, the US has recorded about 120,000 coronavirus deaths - the highest death toll in the world. \nBut one forecasting model run by experts at the University of Washington, which has been cited by the White House in the past, predicts that number will have passed 200,000 by October - a month before the election.

        "title": "The 94-year-old mayor in his 20th election race",
        "description": "In France, 36,000 villages, towns and cities held the first round of mayoral elections in March and will finally hold the second round next weekend, after a three-month delay caused by the coronavirus pandemic. Chris Bockman interviewed one of the hopefuls - the nonagenarian André Trigano.\n\"I hope I am not going to have to apologise again for not being dead.\"\nThat was my introduction to the dapper, and witty, mayor of the town of Pamiers, in the foothills of the French Pyrenees - population, 16,000.\nAndré Trigano is 94 years old and has been in public office for close to 50 years, but he isn't planning on retiring for a while yet.\nHe came top in the first round of the election in March and if he wins the second round on 28 June he will be 101 years old at the end of his mandate.\nThere are other elderly mayors clinging on to the reins of power - including a 98-year-old standing for re-election in a village near Bordeaux - but none has a back story quite as colourful as Trigano's.\nBorn in Paris in 1925, he was a teenager during the German occupation of the city in World War Two. His parents, Jewish immigrants from Algeria, were advised to flee by a police officer living in their building, who told them that the Gestapo had drawn up a warrant for their arrest.\nThey took cover in the mountainous Ariège region, in the south of France, and the young Trigano joined the Resistance. He forged documents to help allied servicemen - often airmen who'd been shot down - escape to Spain. He was arrested three times, but somehow he survived.\nAfter the war, he chose to stay in the south and went into business. \nHis experiences during the occupation had convinced him that the only way to prevent a repeat of the horrors of the past was to get people from different backgrounds and nationalities to go on holiday together.\nHis father and an elder brother had set up a tent-making business before the war and he set up a camping holiday business. Then the family got a contract to supply tents to the newly created Club Med, and André's brother Gilbert, went to work for the company becoming its financial director, then its president and director general. \nAlthough Club Med is now renowned for luxury hotels, for the first 15 years of its existence guests stayed in tents and grass huts, and André helped to source some of the original tents - US Army surplus tents for 10 people that were abundant after the war in continental Europe, and cheap. The idea was to provide simple communal holidays in the sunshine, in locations such as Majorca, Corfu and Djerba in Tunisia. The Club Med mantra, which André Trigano would have approved of and may have helped to inspire, was that everyone was equal on holiday.\nThe Trigano tent-making business prospered, thanks partly to the French state's decision in the mid-1950s to increase paid leave to three weeks per year. It became a major player in the outdoor goods and caravan industry with the slogan, in the 1970s, Le camping - c'est Trigano (Camping - it's Trigano). Meanwhile, André's outdoor holiday firm accumulated dozens of campsites in France, Spain and Portugal.\nThe cash helped him assemble a collection of 120 classic cars, including vintage Citroens, Cadillacs, Triumphs, Rolls Royces, and an Excalibur.\nBut increasingly Trigano focused on politics, turning this corner of the Pyrenees into his personal political fiefdom. He has been mayor of Pamiers, the largest town in the Ariège, for 25 years. Before that he was mayor of a smaller town, Mazeres, for 24 years - and simultaneously, for a while, an MP in the national parliament in Paris.\nHe says his personal wealth inspires trust: people are less worried he'll try to use his position for his own profit.\nSo why, after all this time in public office, is he running again?\nHe says he still has plenty of unfinished business, including plans to renovate the centre of Pamiers, which is a pocket of poverty surrounded by dozens of factories working overtime to make parts for the aerospace industry.\n\"Every night I go to sleep and wake up with a dozen great new ideas for the town,\" he says.\nBut his age has, inevitably, been used against him by his rivals. The two I spoke to both said it was time for him to go.\nYes, he did a lot for the town in the past, said one of them - Maryline Doussat, who runs a local bakery with 20 employees - but he's turned into an elderly autocrat.\nThis explains Trigano's joke about hoping he won't have to apologise for not being dead.\n\"Do I sound lucid? Do I make sense?\" he asks me rhetorically, an hour into the interview. \nThese young - or at least, younger - wannabes must wait their turn, he says.\n\"When you build a 10-storey building, you don't change architects after the fifth floor - that makes no sense,\" he chuckles.\nWith a twinkle in his eye, he tells me that he has run in 19 different elections from mayor to regional council and parliament, and lost just once. \n\"If anyone wants my job, they will have fight for it!\"\nChris Bockman is the author of Are you the foie gras correspondent? Another slow news day in south-west France.\nA Jewish teenager avoided death in occupied France thanks to the kindness and bravery of a doctor in a small Alpine resort. But it's a story local people seem reluctant to remember, Rosie Whitehouse discovers.\nThe doctor who hid a Jewish girl and the resort that wants to forget",

        "title": "Fergus Walsh: At last some good news about coronavirus",
        "description": "It is a rare and welcome moment to be able to say something positive about the treatment of Covid-19. \nUntil this week there was no medicine proven to save lives. Now we have dexamethasone, which cuts the risk of death for patients on a ventilator by a third, and for those on oxygen by a fifth.  \nI seldom use the term \"breakthrough\", but it is worth it here.  \nIt came about due to the persistence and single-mindedness of a small team at Oxford University, the co-operation of hospitals across the UK and the agreement of thousands of patients and their families.  \nThe study that dexamethasone is part of is called Recovery - Randomised Evaluation of Covid-19 Therapy. Clinical trials usually take months, even years to get under way and involve a few hundred patients. The Recovery trial was set up in nine days, and has recruited 11,500 Covid patients in 175 hospitals across the UK.\nSpeed was vital in order to catch the rising wave of hospital admissions here and to do so before doctors were overwhelmed. \nThe UK has had Europe's worst coronavirus outbreak with a terrible death toll. But that has also meant there were sufficient patient numbers here to create what is the world's biggest trial of Covid-19 treatments.\nThe trial is led by Prof Peter Horby, who had spent recent years looking at how best to prepare for and respond to disease X, an unknown pathogen that could cause a pandemic.\nHe told me he'd been frustrated that, during the last pandemic, of H1N1 swine flu, there was a \"massive failure to do proper drug trials\" and they emerged from it with \"zero evidence\" about whether any treatments actually worked.   \nHorby and fellow lead investigator Prof Martin Landray were determined that would not happen with coronavirus.\nThey decided to keep the trial simple. They would test a small number of repurposed or experimental drugs and ask one question - do they cut the risk of death? \nOne of those drugs under evaluation in the randomised trial was low-dose dexamethasone, an anti-inflammatory steroid which has been in use since the early 1960s.\nThis was considered risky. At the start of the pandemic, most international guidelines strongly discouraged the use of steroids for Covid-19.  \nSteroids had been tried during outbreaks of two other deadly coronaviruses, Sars and Mers, with mixed results.   \nDexamethasone is an immunosuppressive drug and there were fears it could make the illness worse, prolonging the infection, and increasing the likelihood of patients needing a ventilator.\n\"We had some senior doctors writing to us saying, 'You really shouldn't be doing this,' and that dampening down the immune system in patients trying to fight an infection was probably not a wise thing to do,\" says Landray. \"The reality was that nobody knew whether dexamethasone would be helpful or harmful.\"\nWhat was missing, until now, was a randomised trial which was big enough to reach firm conclusions. This meant that some of the patients received dexamethasone, and their life or death outcomes were compared to those who did not.\nAs the BBC's medical correspondent, I have reported on global disease threats such as bird flu, swine flu, Sars and Mers - both coronaviruses - and Ebola. You could say I've been waiting much of my career for a global pandemic. And yet when Covid-19 came along, the world was not as ready as it could have been. Sadly, we may have to live with coronavirus indefinitely. Here, I will be reflecting on that. \nThe Recovery team was not expecting to release any results until July. But a week ago the data on dexamethasone came through.\nThe findings were so good that they spent the next few days trying to break them. Did they really stack up? Was the data robust? Only when convinced the results were genuine did they rush out the findings.\nThere are two distinct phases in coronavirus infection. Most people only undergo the first, where the virus invades the body and the immune system mounts an effective response.  \nBut for a minority, the disease alters about a week after infection. The immune system begins to overreact and cause inflammation. At this point it is not the virus, but the body's own response to infection which causes damage in the lungs and beyond.\nThe trial found that dexamethasone helped only those hospital patients who needed oxygen or were on a ventilator. It appears to dampen the immune response, giving the lungs a better chance to recover\nIt is not a magic bullet. On the Covid trial, 40 out of every 100 ventilated patients died. These were intensive care patients who were sedated and put on invasive ventilation, a machine that takes over your breathing for you. Dexamethasone reduced that number to 28, saving one life for every eight patients treated.\nFor those on oxygen 25 out of every 100 patients died, but the drug cut that to about 20 in a 100.  \nThat is still a very high death toll. But it is a start and it will give hope to doctors, patients and their families. Better medicines may follow as a result.\nOvernight the drug became the standard of care and was given to all NHS Covid patients on oxygen or a ventilator. The World Health Organization called it a \"lifesaving scientific breakthrough\", not least because the drug is  extremely cheap and used across the world for a range of conditions.\nThe results were greeted with some scepticism in the US, where several experts said they would only accept them once all the data had been published and peer reviewed.\nIn truth, top-line results of trials are often released at medical conferences, with full disclosure later. The Oxford team say they will publish the results within the next few weeks.     \nSo far, the only other drug proven to be effective against Covid-19 is the antiviral remdesivir. It has been shown to cut the duration of symptoms by about four days. In a trial of about 1,000 patients, those who received it had a slightly lower risk of dying, but it was not statistically significant.  \nRemdesivir, which was developed by the US pharma company Gilead Sciences, has been in short supply. It was excluded from the Recovery trial as there were not enough doses available.\nAlthough Gilead is donating millions of doses during the pandemic, at one point it will need to set a price for the drug. One thing is sure, it won't be as cheap or as widely available as dexamethasone.\nThe Recovery trial is also looking at another anti-inflammatory, as well as an HIV treatment, an antibiotic, and convalescent plasma from donors who've recovered from Covid-19.\nLast week the malaria drug hydroxychloroquine was removed from Recovery after it showed no evidence of benefit. The WHO also halted its trials.\nProfessors Horby and Landray are keen to stress that the Recovery trial is a team effort, involving about 20 staff in Oxford. Add to them the 3,500 doctors, nurses, research and admin staff across the UK who made the trial happen, and finally, the patients, without whom no medical progress would ever be made. Those who were well enough were asked to give their consent, and only after this did they find out whether or not they'd be getting a drug. In most cases it was their families who had to make that decision. With no hospital visits allowed, this was a leap of faith made by loved ones at a time of maximum stress. \n\"I say to everyone involved that they should have a warm feeling about the results we are producing because this is how we advance medicine,\" says Prof Landray.\nThe NHS is uniquely well placed to conduct large randomised trials, not just during pandemics but across all chronic diseases. So there are lessons to be learned here that could ultimately help patients with heart disease, diabetes, arthritis and a host of other conditions. Faster, bigger and simpler sometimes is the way to go. \nFollow @BBCFergusWalsh on Twitter",

        "title": "The blogger who hit back at a Russian 'assassin'",
        "description": "Sergei Skripal was poisoned with the nerve agent Novichok, Alexander Litvinenko was killed with radioactive polonium… by contrast the man who attacked Chechen blogger Tumso Abdurakhmanov was armed with nothing more than a hammer. But he is still convinced that Russian security services were involved, reports Nick Sturdee.\nIt's 26 February 2020. A half-naked man is catching his breath, filming himself in the half light. He's just grabbed the phone and is streaming live on Instagram. He switches from selfie mode and we see a second man, fully dressed, lying face down next to a bed. From his head, a half-metre trail of thick blood, pasted along a linoleum floor across which he has apparently been dragged.\n\"Who sent you?\" demands the man who is filming. \"Who sent you?!\" he repeats, raising his voice.\nHis name is Tumso Abdurakhmanov, and he's a Chechen blogger living in hiding in the town of Gavle, in eastern Sweden.\nHe's holding a hammer, and anxiously looks over his shoulder - clearly concerned there might be someone else in the flat.\n\"Who sent you, I asked!\"\nThe man groans. He says weakly that he was sent by a man from Grozny - the Chechen capital. And that he's from Moscow.\n\"How did you get my address?\" asks Tumso.\n\"They told me.\"\n\"And what's your name?\"\n\"Ruslan.\"\nTumso Abdurakhmanov is an asylum seeker, and he has just managed to beat off a man who assaulted him with a hammer as he slept. He has been expecting something like this to happen. In the preceding six months two other Chechen asylum seekers have been attacked - one gunned down in a Berlin park, the other stabbed to death in a hotel in northern France. He's been tipped off there's money on his head too.\nThree months later, speaking to the BBC from a new, secret location in Sweden, 34-year-old Tumso describes being woken by a series of blows to the head, the struggle to get out from under his duvet, and an exhausting wrestling match that ensued, on and off the bed. Tumso isn't a big man, but at a certain point he succeeded, stunned, in getting on top of his assailant, to see his own blood drip on to the other man's face and into his mouth. The bigger man then overpowered him, but eventually, as they struggled, the hammer fell from his slippery woollen gloves.\nTumso then seized it and dealt a series of blows to his attacker's head.\n\"To start with he fought back fiercely, he tried to protect himself. But after a few blows with the hammer he started to talk to me. Up till then we hadn't spoken at all. I didn't know if he spoke Russian, or who he was. He gave his name. He said, 'Please don't hit me. I'll tell you everything.'\"\nPolice arrived to find the gruesome spectacle of two Russian citizens, their heads bloodied from a vicious fight with a hammer. The larger, fully dressed man had already slipped into unconsciousness. The less wounded of the two - Tumso - was arrested. But after three days of police questioning he was reclassified as a crime victim, and the second man, 29-year-old Ruslan Mamaev, was detained on suspicion of attempted murder, which he denies.\nIn an extremely rare development, the investigation was handed to the country's Security Services. For Tumso's lawyer, Jens Sjolund, the reason is clear - suspicions that another nation state is behind the attack. Russia.\nTumso Abdurakhmanov is one of up to 130,000 Chechen refugees in European countries, many of whom have fled from the violent and tyrannical rule of the semi-autonomous republic's Kremlin-backed leader, Ramzan Kadyrov.\nHe left three years ago after a run-in with the then mayor of Grozny, Kadyrov's cousin, led to threats that he would be disappeared - abducted, tortured and possibly killed - like so many other critics of the regime.\nSince then he has become the single most influential and prominent opponent of Kadyrov in a busy émigré blogosphere. With more than 350,000 subscribers to his YouTube channels - despite the fact that the population of Chechnya is only 1.2 million - he relentlessly hits out at Ramzan Kadyrov's apparently limitless power in Chechnya, the regime's human rights abuses and its corruption.\nNew clouds began to gather for the blogger following a long phone conversation with Ramzan Kadyrov's right-hand man, the chair of the Chechen parliament, Magomed Daudov. In Chechnya this universally feared man, believed to be personally responsible for the well-documented campaign of persecution of the republic's gay community, is known simply by his nickname \"Lord\".\nLord initiated the conversation with Tumso but found himself lambasted by the blogger, who then posted the whole thing on YouTube, in a series of posts lasting more than two hours. Later, when Tumso publicly called Kadyrov's father Akhmat a traitor for siding with the Russians in their 1999 invasion of the republic, Lord evidently decided it was time to teach him a lesson.\nIn March last year Lord posted online an extraordinary announcement for a serving Russian state official. \"Tumso,\" he said, looking at his phone as he filmed himself, \"I am officially telling you from me, and from my brothers. You know who my brothers are. You talked about Akhmat [Kadyrov], and this is now a blood feud. For as long as I have blood in my veins, you are my enemy, and the enemy of my brothers. And we're going to find you.\"\nThe tradition of the blood feud, the revenge killing of a murderer or their relative, is still alive and well in Chechnya. That Tumso had killed nobody did not seem a problem for Lord.\nHe went on to say that Tumso would not actually be killed, he'd just be given an \"amazingly fun time\". But for Chechens, the word for blood feud that Lord used - chir - leaves no room for doubt.\nThings looked even more ominous for Tumso when pro-government social media broadcast the spectacle of his remaining family in Chechnya - an elderly uncle and two other relatives - pronouncing that they were disowning the blogger. More than that, they explicitly gave permission for him to be murdered.\n\"Let them do whatever they like,\" said Tumso's uncle and cousins. \"He is no long longer part of our family. From this moment on, if anyone kills him, we allow that person to take his blood.\" A blood feud was being publicly condoned - evidently under duress - by the planned victim's family.\nWhen the attack came, it was on Lord's birthday - a fact eerily reminiscent of the 2007 murder of the journalist Anna Politkovskaya, one of Kadyrov and Vladimir Putin's most prominent critics, who was shot dead on Putin's birthday, 7 October. In a defiant Instagram post after his release from police questioning, Tumso filmed himself smiling and winking mockingly at the camera, with the written message: \"Happy birthday, Daudov! Sorry I'm a bit late.\"\n С днём рождения, Даудов! Прости, что припозднился 🔨😉\nA post shared by  Mokhmad Abdurakhmanov (@abdurakhmanoff_bros) on Feb 29, 2020 at 3:53pm PST\nEnd of Instagram post  by abdurakhmanoff_bros\nThen he added a hammer emoji.\nTumso - and many Chechens - were in no doubt who was behind the attack. The Chechen authorities deny involvement.\nChechens in Europe's diasporas say they live under the constant threat of retribution and violence - visited either on themselves or on their relatives back at home. Critics have been beaten and pressured, and Kadyrov's opponents murdered widely over the years, in Qatar, Austria, Turkey and Dubai, as well as in Moscow and in Chechnya itself. Some were influential militants - sometimes accused of terrorist attacks in Russia - but others were political rivals, or merely critics.\nRussian security forces appear to have been involved in more than one of the killings.\nLast August Zelimkhan Khangoshvili, a senior commander in the second Chechen war (1999-2005), was approached by a man on a bike and in motorbike leathers in the Kleiner Tiergarten Park in Berlin. Khangoshvili had been on his way to his local mosque for Friday prayers, and had for some reason taken a diversion into the park. His family believe he had been lured there. \nThe cyclist shot Khangoshvili several times, killing him with a shot to the head. He then jumped on a waiting hire scooter, and escaped to a secluded location by the nearby River Spree, where he changed into a pink T-shirt and shorts, and threw a bag into the water. Two teenage boys witnessed the scene and called the police. The man was arrested minutes later, just before he could disappear into the crowd of tourists in central Berlin. He presented a valid Russian passport under a false name. A bag was recovered from the Spree containing the leather clothes, a wig, and a Glock pistol.\nThe assassination had been intricately and expertly planned and, if it hadn't been for the two boys, the killer would probably have escaped undetected. He had arrived in Berlin hours before the murder, after travelling to Poland where it is thought he picked up the pistol. He knew exactly where and when to find Khangoshvili, he had a means of getaway planted precisely where he needed it, and was evidently acting on a pre-determined exit plan. He must have been operating with accomplices and detailed intelligence - raising suspicions of a sophisticated hit by Russian intelligence.\nThese suspicions grew after the journalist Christo Grozev, at the investigative website Bellingcat, established the true identity and biography of the killer - a former Russian special forces soldier called Vadim Krasikov. This man had already committed at least three contract killings in Russia - of businessmen and a regional politician - and had been shielded from prosecution by the intervention of the Russian security services, the FSB. \nHaving identified Krasikov's phone number - through documents online relating to the purchase of a car by his wife - Grozev then used leaked mobile phone data to trace his movements over the weeks running up to his trip to Berlin. Other than his home, the locations where Krasikov had spent most time were the FSB anti-terrorism office in Moscow - for a few hours at a time - and a high-security and heavily restricted FSB special forces training camp just outside Moscow, where he had spent three days before travelling.\nThe Russian security services, it appears, had trained and dispatched someone from the criminal world to eliminate a perceived enemy on the streets of Berlin. Grozev wasn't surprised.\n\"The FSB have their own contingent of former officers,\" he says. \"Or just criminals they can trust or they can hold forever indebted because of, for example, compromising material on them. The FSB is a very corrupt, sprawling organisation.\"\nIn January, a second Chechen was murdered by a travelling assassin, this time, in France. Unlike Khangoshvili, the victim was not a former military commander - he wasn't a potential security threat - but a blogger on medication for PTSD, who had insulted Ramzan Kadyrov online.\nAlthough Tumso Abdurakhmanov was in Sweden at the time, he was tipped off about the appearance of a suspicious Chechen, Usman Mamadiev, among the diaspora in Berlin. Immediately he feared for the safety of his wife, children, mother and brother, who were living in the German capital. He provided Mamadiev's details to German police, he says. But instead the visitor travelled on to Belgium.\nThere he visited the blogger, Imran Aliev, whom he had befriended online, pretending to be a cancer patient travelling to Europe for treatment. On 29 January the two of them travelled to Lille, in northern France, checking in to the Coq Hardi Hotel. The next morning Aliev's body was found in their room, with a reported 135 stab wounds. By then Mamadiev had left for Berlin and was soon on a flight back to Moscow.\nFollowing Aliev's murder, Tumso carried out an investigation and posted the results online. He said he had established Mamadiev's connection to a close Kadyrov ally, a member of the Russian parliament for the ruling United Russia party, Adam Delimkhanov. He also reported that Mamadiev had suspiciously bought a car soon after his return home. \nThe Chechen authorities have denied involvement in Imran Aliev's killing. It has not been possible to reach Mamadiev for comment.\nLess than a month later, Tumso himself was the target. His head and body are marked by scars and wounds from the hammer blows, and he is clearly extremely lucky to be alive. \"It was a miracle,\" he says. \"I realised that as I sat at the police station and thought through what had somehow passed me by. The first emotions you get are impossible to convey. You feel at that moment as though you've been born again, when you think of how you were on the very edge when someone was hitting you with a hammer.\"\nIt was fortunate, perhaps, that his family remained in Germany.\nUnlike Khangoshvili's killer, Tumso's attacker, Ruslan Mamaev, had not travelled on fake ID. It's even easy to find his Facebook page, where the last comment is from his father, Marat, wishing him a happy birthday last August. Photos reveal a tall man with Asiatic features and dark, modishly cut hair, sitting in what looks like a fashionable café, with Central Asian carpets behind him.\nMamaev is originally from Kazakhstan, but moved to Omsk in Siberia as a boy. There he started college but dropped out, before travelling to Moscow and apparently working in construction. Judging from a 2018 court ruling, Mamaev seems to have had money problems. He was ordered to pay back half a million roubles - about £5,500 - that he had borrowed from a bank.\nI've reached out to some of Mamaev's friends and his family. His girlfriend told me on social media that he wouldn't harm another person, that the whole family is in shock and that she doesn't understand how or why he went to Sweden. Apart from that, no-one seems to want to talk.\nNothing in Mamaev's biography seems to suggest a killer - nor any prior connection with Chechnya. But flight data records in Russia, leaked to Bellingcat, do demonstrate that he travelled to Grozny on two occasions shortly before he travelled to Sweden. He returned to Moscow from his second trip on 15 February. Five days later, he booked his flight to Copenhagen for 24 February. Two days after that he was in Tumso's flat in Sweden, with a hammer.\nIt has also emerged that immediately after his December trip to Grozny, Mamaev flew to Copenhagen - on what looks like a short recce. According to Bellingcat, it was the first time he had ever travelled outside the former Soviet Union, and he speaks no foreign languages. Like Krasikov in Berlin, he would certainly have been receiving help from accomplices. \nA second individual, a Chechen woman, has been detained by Swedish police as a suspect. She travelled to Sweden from France shortly before the attack. And last weekend the Swedish authorities announced they were arresting - in absentia - a third Russian citizen. He's been named as Imran Khaskhanov, a Chechen from Mamaev's hometown of Omsk, and he's also believed to have travelled to Sweden at the time of the attack.\nMamaev's motive for apparently trying to kill a man he had never met is unclear, but Tumso has a theory. Much as Vadim Krasikov may have been drawn into the FSB's orbit as a result of his prosecution for murder, Tumso believes that Mamaev's debts may have laid him open to recruitment and exploitation by those who wanted to organise an assassination attempt that could easily be denied.\nTumso is confident that the organisation of the attack was beyond the abilities of Kadyrov's circle. Mamaev had managed to establish Tumso's address in hiding, to get through a door requiring a pincode, and to find and enter his apartment unnoticed as he slept. The blogger believes this points to FSB involvement.\nBut Tumso is not a defector from Russian military intelligence, like Sergei Skripal, or a former officer of the FSB working as a consultant for British intelligence, like Alexander Litvinenko. Why would the FSB organise an assassination attempt on a Chechen blogger living in Sweden? Tumso, again, has an explanation - money.\n\"I have information - which I can't prove or confirm - that the FSB may have sold that information to Kadyrov. And if that's true, there's nothing remotely strange about that,\" he says. \"This is Russia - and it's totally normal for different state structures merely to sell things to each other. In Chechnya we've seen that for a long time.\"\nThe relationship between Russia and Chechnya, one of the Russian Federation's 22 republics, is itself partly a financial one. Moscow props up Chechnya by pouring in millions of dollars. In return Kadyrov's brutal rule ensures there is no dissent.\n\"It's a marriage of convenience,\" says Katya Sokirianskaia of the Moscow based Conflict Analysis and Prevention Centre. \"Very clearly Putin thinks that Ramzan is solving his problems in Chechnya. On the other hand, on the Ramzan side, it is very clear that Vladimir Putin guarantees his biological survival - the survival of Ramzan himself and his family, his children and his close friends, his circle.\"\nBecause Kadyrov and his circle, as they well know, can not only declare blood feuds - they can be the subject of them.\n\"Ramzan Kadyrov has blood enemies, and many of his associates as well. They have blood. People who blame them for death and humiliation. And they're waiting for the moment to take their revenge, to execute this blood feud. And Chechens can wait for a very long time.\"\nIt's not known who ordered Ruslan Mamaev to travel to Sweden and attack Tumso with a hammer as he slept. It's not known whether the FSB was involved, and it cannot be proved it was the execution of a blood feud\nBut the second most powerful public official in Chechnya expressly warned of such an action, and pro-government social media effectively condoned it by carrying the statement made by Tumso's relatives, in which they gave their consent for him to be murdered.\nAnd for this, it would appear, neither Kadyrov nor the Chechen government have received any criticism from the Russian government - or President Vladimir Putin.\nA series of assassinations has taken place in Turkey of men from the countries of the former USSR. There's evidence that some were carried out by killers from Russia - including, in one case, names, photographs and a memory stick carelessly left behind for Turkish police to study.\nHave Russian hitmen been killing with impunity in Turkey?

        "title": "Trump addresses Tulsa rally amid virus fears",
        "description": "US President Donald Trump has begun addressing supporters at his first campaign rally since March, when the US coronavirus lockdown began.\nEarlier, organisers cancelled an \"overflow\" event at Tulsa's 19,000-seat Bank of Oklahoma Center when the expected crowds failed to materialise.\nThere are concerns the event could increase the spread of Covid-19. \nThose attending must sign a waiver protecting the Trump campaign from responsibility for any illness.\nHours before the rally, the campaign said six staff members involved in organising it had tested positive.\nOn Friday, Oklahoma's supreme court rejected a lawsuit asking that social distancing guidelines be followed.\nThe Trump campaign said attendees would have to pass temperature checks before being allowed into the venue - and that they would be offered face masks. \nMore than 2.2 million cases of Covid-19 and 119,000 associated deaths have been reported in the US, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.\nMr Trump's re-election campaign rally is one of the biggest indoor gatherings in the US since the country's Covid-19 outbreak began.\nThe Trump campaign said it had received more than a million ticket requests, and that the president would speak inside the BOK Center and at an outdoor stage set up nearby for overflow crowds. When the numbers failed to appear, campaign officials cancelled the outdoor appearance, blaming \"radical protesters\" and the media for attempting to \"frighten off\" supporters.\nIn his opening remarks, Mr Trump said there had been \"very bad people outside, they were doing bad things\", but did not elaborate.\nSupporters began queuing earlier this week for a chance to get into the arena, and 100,000 people or more were expected to gather in central Tulsa.\nThis week the number of new cases of Covid-19 in Oklahoma has been rising and local health officials fear the rally could become a \"super spreader\" event. \nIn a Facebook post, Tulsa Mayor GT Bynum acknowledged that Tulsa's residents were divided over it being the first city to host such an event.\n\"We do this as our positive Covid-19 cases are rising, but while our hospital capacity remains strong. Some think it is great, some think it is reckless. Regardless of where each of us falls on that spectrum, we will go through it as a community,\" he wrote.\nPolitical rallies are a source of inspiration as well as invigoration for Donald Trump. He draws energy from arenas filled with enthusiastic supporters, and uses their responses to the various riffs in his sometimes long, free-form speeches to sense what issues resonate with his loyal base.\nFor more than three months, as Covid-19 has spread across the US, the president has had to do without these emotional and strategic sounding boards. Now, the rallies are coming back, even though cases of the virus are reaching new record peaks in many states and public health officials continue to warn of the dangers of large gatherings.\nWith less than five months until election day, the president is billing this as the beginning of his re-election bid. Given that he held his official campaign kick-off in Orlando almost exactly a year ago, it perhaps is better seen as a re-boot of a campaign that has struggled to gain its footing as the nation has been beset by the pandemic and mass demonstrations against institutional racism and excessive force by police. \nThe president is now billing his campaign around the slogan \"the Great American Comeback\". Given the recent turmoil, and Mr Trump's sagging poll numbers, he is clearly hoping the Tulsa rally is the beginning of his own political revival.\nThere were also concerns among officials in Tulsa that there would be clashes between supporters and opponents of the president, but no serious trouble was reported. \nEmotions are still running high following the killing of an unarmed black man, George Floyd, by police in Minneapolis last month, which sparked widespread anti-racism protests.\nMayor Bynum declared on Thursday a curfew covering the area around the BOK Center, citing the risk of \"civil unrest\". But on Friday, Mr Trump announced that the curfew had been lifted for \"our many supporters\". \nHe also warned: \"Any protesters, anarchists, agitators, looters or lowlifes who are going to Oklahoma please understand, you will not be treated like you have been in New York, Seattle, or Minneapolis. It will be a much different scene!\"\nMr Trump had initially planned to hold the rally on Friday. But he changed the date last week after learning it fell on 19 June, known as Juneteenth, which marks the end of slavery in the US.\nThe choice of location is also controversial. In 1921, Tulsa was the scene of a race riot in which white mobs attacked black people and businesses. \nAt a peaceful Juneteenth rally in Tulsa on Friday, the civil rights activist Al Sharpton said campaigners could \"Make America Great\" for everybody for the first time.

        "description": "A far-left party in Germany has erected a controversial statue of communist leader Vladimir Lenin.\nThe tiny Marxist-Leninist Party of Germany (MLPD) installed the statue in front of its headquarters in the western city of Gelsenkirchen.\nCity authorities had attempted to stop the statue being installed and launched an online hashtag saying there was \"no place for Lenin\".\nBut courts blocked their appeals and the unveiling went ahead on Saturday.\nLenin was a leader of the 1917 Russian Revolution and led the country until his death in 1924, when he was succeeded by Josef Stalin. However, he has remained a symbol of communism rule across the world, both among supporters and those who remember the human rights abuses that took place under the USSR.\nGermany itself was divided for decades between the West and the communist East, until the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989.\nIn the debate surrounding the Gelsenkirchen statue, which was made in Czechoslovakia, as it was then known, in 1957, both sides drew parallels to the tearing down of monuments linked to slavery which has taken place in anti-racism protests across the world in recent weeks.\n\"We live in a time in which many countries of the world are reflecting on memorials,\" said mayor Frank Baranowski in one of a series of YouTube videos posted by the city council against the statue.\n\"It's hard to put up with the fact that a dictator from the 21st Century is being placed on a pedestal and a memorial is being made out of it. Unfortunately the courts have decided otherwise, we must accept that, but not without comment.\"\nHowever, MLPD's chair, Gabi Fechtner, described the communist leader as \"an ahead-of-his-time thinker of world-historical importance, an early fighter for freedom and democracy\", according to the AFP news agency.",

        "description": "US President Donald Trump has fired a top federal prosecutor who refused to leave office, Attorney General William Barr has said.\nGeoffrey Berman, the US Attorney for the Southern District of New York, said on Friday that he had learned he was \"stepping down\" in a press release.\nMr Berman insisted he would stay in post and continue his investigations.\nOn Saturday, Mr Barr told him that he had asked the president to remove him immediately, and that he had done so.\nTop US Democrat Nancy Pelosi said she believed there were \"base and improper motives\" in the sacking of Mr Berman and that the Attorney General \"must be held accountable for his actions\".\nMr Berman oversaw the prosecution of a number of Mr Trump's associates.\nThey included the president's former lawyer Michael Cohen, who has served a prison sentence for lying to Congress and election campaign finance fraud. \nMr Berman's department has also been investigating the conduct of Rudy Giuliani, Mr Trump's current personal lawyer.\nThe row between the attorney general and the top federal prosecutor in Manhattan began on Friday night, when Mr Barr issued a press release announcing that Mr Berman was \"stepping down\" after two-and-a-half years in the post.      \nMr Berman had \"done an excellent job\", achieving \"many successes on consequential civil and criminal matters\", Mr Barr said.\nHe added that the president intended to nominate Securities and Exchange Commission chairman Jay Clayton, who has never served as a federal prosecutor, as Mr Berman's successor.\nNot long afterwards, Mr Berman issued his own a statement, saying he had learned he was \"stepping down\" from the press release.\n\"I have not resigned, and have no intention of resigning, my position,\" he added. \"I will step down when a presidentially appointed nominee is confirmed by the Senate.\" \nMr Barr's announcement appeared to surprise the Republican chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Lindsey Graham.  \nHe who said that Mr Clayton's nomination would still have to be approved by New York's two Senators, Chuck Schumer and Kirsten Gillibrand, who are both Democrats.\nSenator Schumer tweeted: \"This late Friday night dismissal reeks of potential corruption of the legal process. What is angering President Trump? A previous action by this US Attorney or one that is ongoing?\" \nIn a letter to Mr Berman released by the justice department on Saturday, Mr Barr wrote that they had discussed his intention to appoint Mr Clayton as US attorney and that he had hoped for co-operation \"to facilitate a smooth transition\".\n\"Unfortunately, with your statement of last night, you have chosen public spectacle over public service. Because you have declared that you have no intention of resigning, I have asked the president to remove you as of today, and he has done so,\" he added.\nThis is unbelievable. The handling has been woeful. Just read this statement from the US Attorney General. #Berman #WilliamBarr pic.twitter.com/g5R4U3euLq\nEnd of Twitter post  by @BBCJonSopel\nMr Barr said Mr Berman's deputy, Audrey Strauss, would become the acting US attorney and that he anticipated she would serve in that capacity until a permanent successor was in place.\nLater, Mr Berman said that \"in light of Attorney General Barr's decision to respect the normal operation of law\" and to have Ms Strauss become acting US attorney, he would be leaving office, \"effective immediately\".\n\"It has been the honour of a lifetime to serve as this District's US attorney and a custodian of its proud legacy, but I could leave the district in no better hands than Audrey's.\"\n\"I know that under her leadership, this office's unparalleled AUSAs [Assistant United States Attorneys], investigators, paralegals, and staff will continue to safeguard the Southern District's enduring tradition of integrity and independence,\" he added.\nBefore leaving the White House for a campaign rally in Tulsa, President Trump told reporters that the decision to fire Mr Berman was a matter for the attorney general.\n\"That's his department, not my department. But we have a very capable attorney general, so that's really up to him. I'm not involved.\"",

This should never to happen again!!!\" the president added. \nLater, the president called the ruling a \"BIG COURT WIN against Bolton\". \nA lawyer for Mr Bolton, Charles Cooper, welcomed the judge's decision to deny the injunction request.\nHowever, he took issue with the conclusion that his client did not comply fully with his contractual pre-publication obligation to the government.\n\"The full story of these events has yet to be told - but it will be,\" he added.\nMr Bolton's publisher, Simon & Schuster, said: \"We are grateful that the Court has vindicated the strong First Amendment protections against censorship and prior restraint of publication.\"\nMr Bolton became Mr Trump's national security adviser in April 2018.\nHe left his post in September 2019, after disagreeing strongly with the president over how to handle major challenges like Iran, North Korea and Afghanistan.\nIn The Room Where It Happened, Mr Bolton portrays Mr Trump as an \"erratic\", \"impulsive\" and \"stunningly uninformed\" leader. \nAmong the allegations, which are based on private conversations and are impossible to verify, are that:",

        "title": "Trump addresses Tulsa rally amid virus fears",
        "description": "US President Donald Trump has begun addressing supporters at his first campaign rally since March, when the US coronavirus lockdown began.\nEarlier, organisers cancelled an \"overflow\" event at Tulsa's 19,000-seat Bank of Oklahoma Center when the expected crowds failed to materialise.\nThere are concerns the event could increase the spread of Covid-19. \nThose attending must sign a waiver protecting the Trump campaign from responsibility for any illness.\nHours before the rally, the campaign said six staff members involved in organising it had tested positive.\nOn Friday, Oklahoma's supreme court rejected a lawsuit asking that social distancing guidelines be followed.\nThe Trump campaign said attendees would have to pass temperature checks before being allowed into the venue - and that they would be offered face masks. \nMore than 2.2 million cases of Covid-19 and 119,000 associated deaths have been reported in the US, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.\nMr Trump's re-election campaign rally is one of the biggest indoor gatherings in the US since the country's Covid-19 outbreak began.\nThe Trump campaign said it had received more than a million ticket requests, and that the president would speak inside the BOK Center and at an outdoor stage set up nearby for overflow crowds. When the numbers failed to appear, campaign officials cancelled the outdoor appearance, blaming \"radical protesters\" and the media for attempting to \"frighten off\" supporters.\nIn his opening remarks, Mr Trump said there had been \"very bad people outside, they were doing bad things\", but did not elaborate.\nSupporters began queuing earlier this week for a chance to get into the arena, and 100,000 people or more were expected to gather in central Tulsa.\nThis week the number of new cases of Covid-19 in Oklahoma has been rising and local health officials fear the rally could become a \"super spreader\" event. \nIn a Facebook post, Tulsa Mayor GT Bynum acknowledged that Tulsa's residents were divided over it being the first city to host such an event.\n\"We do this as our positive Covid-19 cases are rising, but while our hospital capacity remains strong. Some think it is great, some think it is reckless. Regardless of where each of us falls on that spectrum, we will go through it as a community,\" he wrote.\nPolitical rallies are a source of inspiration as well as invigoration for Donald Trump. He draws energy from arenas filled with enthusiastic supporters, and uses their responses to the various riffs in his sometimes long, free-form speeches to sense what issues resonate with his loyal base.\nFor more than three months, as Covid-19 has spread across the US, the president has had to do without these emotional and strategic sounding boards. Now, the rallies are coming back, even though cases of the virus are reaching new record peaks in many states and public health officials continue to warn of the dangers of large gatherings.\nWith less than five months until election day, the president is billing this as the beginning of his re-election bid. Given that he held his official campaign kick-off in Orlando almost exactly a year ago, it perhaps is better seen as a re-boot of a campaign that has struggled to gain its footing as the nation has been beset by the pandemic and mass demonstrations against institutional racism and excessive force by police. \nThe president is now billing his campaign around the slogan \"the Great American Comeback\". Given the recent turmoil, and Mr Trump's sagging poll numbers, he is clearly hoping the Tulsa rally is the beginning of his own political revival.\nThere were also concerns among officials in Tulsa that there would be clashes between supporters and opponents of the president, but no serious trouble was reported. \nEmotions are still running high following the killing of an unarmed black man, George Floyd, by police in Minneapolis last month, which sparked widespread anti-racism protests.\nMayor Bynum declared on Thursday a curfew covering the area around the BOK Center, citing the risk of \"civil unrest\". But on Friday, Mr Trump announced that the curfew had been lifted for \"our many supporters\". \nHe also warned: \"Any protesters, anarchists, agitators, looters or lowlifes who are going to Oklahoma please understand, you will not be treated like you have been in New York, Seattle, or Minneapolis. It will be a much different scene!\"\nMr Trump had initially planned to hold the rally on Friday. But he changed the date last week after learning it fell on 19 June, known as Juneteenth, which marks the end of slavery in the US.\nThe choice of location is also controversial. In 1921, Tulsa was the scene of a race riot in which white mobs attacked black people and businesses. \nAt a peaceful Juneteenth rally in Tulsa on Friday, the civil rights activist Al Sharpton said campaigners could \"Make America Great\" for everybody for the first time.

        "title": "Beijing to set up new security office in Hong Kong",
        "description": "China's new security law for Hong Kong envisages setting up an office in the territory to gather intelligence and handle crimes against national security, state media say.\nThe new security law will also override any local laws that conflict with it, Xinhua news agency reported.\nThe planned law has sparked protests and drawn international condemnation.\nCritics say it will destroy the freedoms Hong Kong enjoys but which are not available in mainland China.\nOn Friday the European Parliament voted to take China to the International Court of Justice in The Hague if the law was imposed.\nBut China says the law is needed to tackle separatist activity, subversion, terrorism and collusion with foreign elements and rejects criticism a interference in its affairs.\nHong Kong was handed back to China from British control in 1997 under an agreement centring on a \"one country, two systems\" principle that guaranteed certain freedoms for Hong Kong and that do not apply in the mainland.\nDetails were published after a three-day meeting of the main decision-making body in China's parliament, the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress.\nA new national security office in Hong Kong would deal with national security cases, but would also have other powers such as overseeing education about national security in Hong Kong schools.\nXinhua also said that Hong Kong's leader Carrie Lam would be able to appoint specific judges to hear national security cases.\nMs Lam has backed the proposed law and has denied that Hong Kong's freedoms under the \"one country, two systems\" will be affected.\nThe Hong Kong government will be required to carry out most enforcement under the new law, but Beijing will be able to overrule the Hong Kong authorities in some cases.\n\"If the local laws... are inconsistent with this Law, the provisions of this Law shall apply. The power to interpret this law belongs to the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress,\" Xinhua said.\nThe process of creating and finalising legislation in China usually takes some years, BBC Reality Check's Wanyuan Song says, with one law for Taiwan taking five years to pass from when it was first proposed.\nBut state media says the new security law planned for Hong Kong could be published this summer, although it was proposed just a few months ago, she adds.\nBy Celia Hatton, Asia-Pacific editor, BBC News \nIn one short but powerful document, Beijing initiated the most dramatic changes to Hong Kong's power structure since the territory was handed back from Britain in 1997. \nThe new law says unequivocally that it will override any divergent legislation in Hong Kong, effectively wiping out the Chinese territory's own body of laws and regulations.\nChinese leaders contend the law will target only a handful of terrorists and separatists, but key details have yet to be released: namely, what falls under the umbrella of national security and what constitutes a crime. \nThe legislation won't be imposed without a fight: many in Hong Kong are fiercely opposed to the law, fearing it will erase their existing freedoms. And if the national security law does become a reality, Beijing faces international ramifications. \nThe US says the law means Hong Kong is no longer sufficiently autonomous to merit special treatment under US law.\nThis potentially paves the way for Hong Kong to be stripped of trading privileges, such as lower tariffs, meaning that the US would treat it the same as any other mainland Chinese city for trading purposes.\nMeanwhile the UK says it will change its immigration rules and offer millions of people in Hong Kong \"a route to citizenship\" if China imposes the new law.\nThe 1997 handover agreement between the UK and China - a mini-constitution called the Basic Law and a so-called \"one country, two systems\" principle - envisages Hong Kong rights that include freedom of assembly and speech, an independent judiciary and some democratic rights which no other part of mainland China has.\nUnder the same agreement, Hong Kong is expected to enact its own national security law - this was set out in Article 23 of the Basic Law.\nBut its unpopularity means it has never been done - the government tried in 2003 but had to back down after protests.\nThen, last year, protests over an extradition law turned violent and evolved into a broader anti-China and pro-democracy movement.\nChina doesn't want to see that happen again.",

        "title": "Zimbabwe minister charged with virus corruption",
        "description": "Zimbabwe's health minister has been granted bail after appearing in court.\nObadiah Moyo was arrested on Friday after the government came under pressure from the opposition and on social media over a scandal surrounding the procurement of coronavirus tests and equipment.\nHe faces corruption charges related to a $20m (£16m) contract awarded to a Hungary-registered firm, allegedly without going through proper processes.\nThe government has not commented. \nMy Moyo is the second minister in Emmerson Mnangagwa's cabinet to face corruption charges.\nHe arrived in court in a state-issued luxury car accompanied by aides, the BBC's Harare correspondent Shingai Nyoka says.\nDuring the hearing, he was charged with several counts of criminal abuse of office and ordered to surrender his passport. He is expected to appear in court again by the end of July.\nAccording to local media, prosecutors had initially opposed Mr Moyo's release but later agreed that he be granted bail.\nThe deal with two-month old firm Drax Consult is alleged to have been completed without the legal consent of Zimbabwe's procurement registration authority.\nThe opposition has also expressed concern about a $2m payment to Drax Consult. The payment was flagged as suspicious by Hungarian authorities in March.\nLast week businessman Delish Nguwaya, who is believed to be Drax's representative in Zimbabwe, was arrested in connection with the case. \nTwo others have also been arrested.\nShingai Nyoka, BBC\nIt is rare for cabinet ministers to be arrested here. A government spokesperson described this arrest as a reflection of government's commitment to fighting corruption, adding that no one is immune from prosecution. \nBut it is too early to celebrate victory.\nSince Emmerson Mnangagwa came to power, Zimbabwe has seen a large number of high profile corruption cases, but many have ended in acquittals. \nPeople started raising questions about how a controversial businessman, who had failed a vetting process months earlier, had managed to set up a new company and secure millions of dollars' worth of contracts to supply medicines and equipment - some at hugely inflated prices.\nThe government has since cancelled all contracts with Drax, the state-run Herald newspaper reported.\nZimbabwe says it has confirmed nearly 500 virus cases, including four deaths, but the actual number of cases is thought to be higher.\nThe country is also facing its worst economic crisis in more than a decade and there is mounting public anger over poor services and corruption.",

        "title": "Mariana Trench: Son repeats historic ocean dive",
        "description": "It used to be said that more people had walked on the surface of the Moon than had dived to the deepest part of Earth's oceans. Not anymore.\nKelly Walsh, the son of the great ocean explorer Don Walsh, has just descended to the bottom of the Mariana Trench, almost 11km down in the Pacific. \nHe made the dive 60 years after his father created history in doing so.\nIt means Kelly is the 12th person to visit the trench floor - the same as the number of Apollo moonwalkers.\nThe 12-hour dive on Saturday saw him reach a depth of approximately 10,925m.\nKelly described it as \"a hugely emotional journey\" after returning to the surface.\nThe descent was piloted by the financier and adventurer Victor Vescovo. The Texan is conducting a series of dives into the lowest point of the Mariana Trench known as the Challenger Deep. \nMr Vescovo has acquired a support ship and human-rated submersible that he is using to survey several of the most extreme places on the ocean floor.\nRecent passengers who've gone down with him to the Challenger Deep include the first women to make the journey - the former Nasa astronaut Kathy Sullivan and the British-American mountaineer Vanessa O'Brien.\nBut Kelly Walsh's descent is particularly noteworthy because of his father, Don. On 23 January, 1960, the then US Navy officer, accompanied by Swiss national Jacques Piccard, made the first crewed dive to the floor of Earth's deepest ocean trench using the bathyscaphe Trieste.\nIt was an astonishing achievement given the precarious nature of the expedition. The trench is so deep, it would be possible to fit Mount Everest (8,848m) inside it and still have more than 2km of water above the peak. The pressure at the trench floor is crushing - some 100 million pascals, almost 16,000 pounds per square inch.\nSixty years on, modern technology means Victor Vescovo can reliably make very safe, repeat dives, so much so that he himself has now been down seven times in his submersible, the 12-tonne Deep Sea Vehicle (DSV) Limiting Factor.\nOn Saturday, Vescovo and Walsh spent fours hours at the bottom of what's called the \"western pool\" - one of three distinct zones in the Challenger Deep. It's the same pool that Don Walsh and Piccard visited, and the latest dive marked the first time anyone had been back since.\nThe Scottish marine biologist Alan Jamieson is one of the 12 who've made the dive to the bottom of the Mariana Trench. He went with Mr Vescovo to a slightly shallower (10,700m) location just to the east of Challenger Deep known as the Sirena Deep.\nOf Kelly Walsh's dive, he said: \"It's a commemoration of what his father did. It's also a kind of demonstration that we haven't lost that capability. People often ask why we don't seem able at the moment to go to the Moon having done it in the 60s and 70s. Likewise, with the deep ocean, Don Walsh went to the bottom of the Mariana Trench and then for several decades we didn't go anymore. But now we're showing we can do it again, and we're doing it loads.\"\nDr Jamieson is in the process of joining up with Mr Vescovo's expedition. There's a plan to take the DSV Limiting Factor shortly to the Philippine Trench, which in terms of depth at 10,500m is third only to the Mariana and Tonga trenches. \nBut it's a highly significant location in the history of ocean exploration, explained Dr Jon Copley from the University of Southampton.\nIt's where the Danish Galathea expedition in 1951 trawled animals from more than 10km down. It was the first proof that higher animals could live deeper than 10,000m, he told BBC News. \nVictor Vescovo's exploits can be followed on the website of Caladan Oceanic, which has organised the venture with Triton Submarines, who developed the Limiting Factor, and EYOS Expeditions.\nDr Copley keeps a history of ocean exploration on his blog.\nSource: Dr Jon Copley @expeditionlog\nJonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter: @BBCAmos",

        "title": "'Cashpoint aid' and Africa: Who benefits?",
        "description": "Across Africa the news that a former colonial power, the UK, is to take a more strategic, political, hard-nosed approach to the way it spends its overseas aid budget, has been greeted with a mixture of frustration and cynicism.\nIn announcing a merger between the Foreign Office (FCO) and the Department of International Development (DfID), Prime Minister Boris Johnson argued that the UK should be directing more attention and money towards countering Russian influence in nearby eastern Europe, and, by implication, spending less money in distant former colonies like Zambia and Tanzania where \"for too long British overseas aid has been treated as some giant cashpoint in the sky\".\nIn Ghana, the head of the West African Civil Society Institute, Nana Afadzinu, criticised the British move as part of a broader trend of Western countries becoming \"more myopic and inward-looking.\" \nShe said Covid-19 had exacerbated the trend, as had Brexit.\n\"Building international solidarity, supporting issues like human rights and an international development system - these are not going to be important [for foreign donors] any more,\" she said.\n\"The challenge for us, for African leaders, is to unite, to stand as one.\"\nThe link with Brexit, and Britain's search for a new global role outside the European Union, appears clear. \nSupporting the merger of the FCO and DfID, the UK's former Foreign Secretary, Jeremy Hunt, spoke of the need for London to have a stronger voice on the African continent in order to counter Chinese influence.\n\"In Africa today, there is competition - intense competition - between countries such as China that do not promote democracy and human rights as part of their aid agenda, and countries such as Britain that do,\" he said.\n\"And if we are going to support those British values, we need to speak with one voice.\"\nBut the notion of Africa as battleground for competing outside influences has a long and troubled history on the continent  - from the 19th Century colonial \"scramble for Africa\", through the Cold War's proxy conflicts, to the US and China's growing rivalry, and even today's struggle to access Covid-19 medicine. \nMany involved in the aid and development world argue that the UK, like other former colonial powers, still owes the continent a huge debt for the wealth it extracted - and continues to extract in the form of African doctors and nurses, for instance, who are encouraged to emigrate to the West.\nIndeed, one insider angrily complained that it was Africa which was still treated like a \"cashpoint\" by the West, rather than the other way round.\nIn Kenya, Degan Ali, who runs the non-governmental organisation Adeso, said Britain's announcement simply revealed what had always been the case - that foreign aid has always been part of a Western-run global system that perpetuates patterns of inequality and poverty.\n\"I think in many ways aid policies have always been dictated by foreign policy, especially in former colonies,\" she said.\n\"I think the whole [British] merger is just a confirmation - making official what has been unofficial. This is all part of the same humanitarian and development architecture that perpetuates structures of inequality.\"\nBut in recent years, DfID has earned a strong reputation across much of Africa as one of the best - if not the best - development agencies of its kind, and a loud and important voice in steering aid money away from corrupt or ineffectual governments and deals.\n\"Why would you take away a Rolls Royce and replace it with a Vauxhall Astra?\" asked another regional expert with close knowledge of DfID, who asked not to be identified, but who shared the widespread concern that the changes might damage, rather than strengthen, the UK's global influence and reputation.\n\"By weakening [DfID's] voice in strategic discussions you'll see quicker decisions, but of poorer quality,\" the expert warned.\n\"It's a significant loss of [British] soft power and DfID will lose a lot of technical competence and transparency.\"\nA departmental reshuffle in far-away Britain in the middle of a global pandemic might seem like a relatively trivial event - and indeed there are plenty of people who argue that the merger may prove successful, and point to other Western nations like Canada which have already done something similar.\nOthers say that decades of Western development aid have proved spectacularly ineffective in addressing poverty and that what Africa really needs - and many point to tiny Rwanda as a leading example - is a determination to wean itself off all-too-addictive Western aid altogether.\n\"There's always been a scramble for Africa, an attempt to partition Africa, and now we have China playing a huge role too,\" says Ms Afadzinu in Ghana.\n\"And I don't think Africans are blind to it. We need to be bold enough to take a stance against Western power and influence. \n\"But unfortunately there's always a divide between francophone and anglophone Africa. \n\"There's always this insidious work being done to make sure those fault lines are deepened. We are pawns in the hands of these different global powers and our leaders have not risen up to the challenge.\"",

        "title": "Five reasons why coronavirus is so bad in Yemen",
        "description": "Coronavirus could spread faster, wider and with deadlier consequences in Yemen than many other countries in the world, the UN says. Here's five reasons why.\nSince 2015, Yemen has been devastated by conflict, leaving millions of people without access to proper health care, clean water or sanitation - crucial for preventing the virus from spreading.\nVital food, medical and humanitarian supplies have been restricted by a partial land, sea and air blockade put in place by a Saudi-led coalition of countries fighting Houthi rebels - while the rebels themselves have obstructed the distribution of aid.\nNot having a central government in charge (rebels drove the government out of the capital and into the south of the country) makes coronavirus harder to contain.\nConditions in Yemen put the population at particular risk to a highly contagious disease.\nAlmost three years before the advent of Covid-19, the UN declared Yemen the most needy place on Earth. Some 24 million people there - that's about 80% of the population - depend on aid to survive, and millions are on the brink of starvation. \nAn estimated 2 million children are acutely malnourished, and the country was already struggling to cope with diseases such as dengue fever, malaria and cholera before the first cases of coronavirus were reported. \nWeakened immune systems mean those suffering from chronic illnesses could contract Covid-19 more easily, and find it harder to survive.\nFive years of war has shattered the country's health system, leaving it incapable of coping with a pandemic. \nMany of Yemen's 3,500 medical facilities have been damaged or destroyed in air strikes, and only half are thought to be fully functioning. \nClinics are reported to be crowded, and basic medicines and equipment are lacking - in a country of 27.5 million people there are only a few hundred ventilator machines, which are used to help patients breathe in cases where coronavirus leads to lung failure. \nWithout knowing more accurately who has got coronavirus, it is more difficult to prevent its spread or plan for numbers of patients putting additional strain on the already fragile health system.\nSince the first coronavirus patient was reported in government-held areas in April, the true scale of the outbreak has been impossible to determine. \nThe government has declared just over 900 cases, while rebels who control the capital and other densely populated areas say they have detected only four cases in their territory. \nThe UN says that with testing kits in short supply and a lack of transparency in data from the rebels and the government, the actual number of cases are almost certainly much higher across the board. \nAlongside a lack of medicine to treat cases, medics in Yemen lack personal protection equipment (PPE), such as masks and gowns, to shield them from the disease. \n An unconfirmed report on privately owned Al-Masdar news website said dozens of medics had died as a result of Covid-19 in both rebel- and government-held areas. \nOne of the most prominent infectious disease experts in Yemen, Yassin Abdul Wareth, died from Covid-19 earlier this month, in what was described as a major blow to Yemen's health sector.",

        "description": "Singer Alexandra Burke has spoken out about her experiences of racism in the music industry, revealing she was asked to bleach her skin \"to look whiter\".\nAfter winning X Factor, Burke said she was told she would \"have to work 10 times harder than a white artist, because of the colour of your skin\".\nIn a 15-minute Instagram video, she recalls being told: \"You can't have braids, you can't have an afro.\n\"You have to have hair... that appeals to white people.\"\nThe 31-year-old star, who won the TV talent show in 2008 at the age of 19, described the experiences as \"heartbreaking\".\nBurke, who refused to bleach her skin, said she was inspired to tell her story by fellow X Factor contestant Misha B, who recently spoke out about \"being devalued\" at the hands of the music industry.\nMisha B claimed the X Factor projected \"this angry black girl narrative\", using words such as \"feisty\" and \"bully\" to describe her after one a live performance on the show. The 2011 contestant said it left her feeling suicidal.\n\"I could have spoken up much earlier, but was too scared to,\" said Burke, whose Instagram post has attracted a lot of attention, and sympathy, on social media.\nThe music star revealed the micro-aggressions she experienced at the hands of record labels, being told regularly that she \"comes across aggressive\".\nShe said she was told: \"You can't release this kind of music, because white people don't understand that\", and added: \"I am so upset with myself that I allowed that.\" \nBurke, whose hit singles Hallelujah, Bad Boys and All Night Long were all nominated for Brit Awards, also played the lead in the critically acclaimed West End musical The Bodyguard.\nThe singer said was told: \"Because you're a black girl, you won't make it that far in the industry... if you were white, you would be bigger than what you are now, you could sell more records, you'd be a Brit Award-winner\".\n\"It's hurtful,\" she added.\nShe was raised in north London by her mother, Soul II Soul singer Melissa Bell, who died in August 2017 - just before Burke was due to take part in Strictly Come Dancing.\nShe recalled how one journalist accused her of \"being a diva\" when she asked not to do any publicity on the show's red carpet, which happened to be taking place on the same day as her mother died.\n\"That was the image they had of me, because of the papers.\" she said. \"I was so scared on that show. So many trolls, telling me all kinds of stuff. \n\"I have no idea how I got through it. I don't even like thinking about that experience. It's simply because of me being a black, strong woman. \n\"I can speak up for myself because that's how I've been taught. But I would never do it in a way that offends people or hurts anyone.\"\nShe said the Black Lives Matter movement had persuaded her to share her experiences because \"the truth is all we've got\".\n\"I just feel like people need to not see colour,\" said Burke. \"My mum always raised me to never see colour. I will continue that way because that's what makes me happy. \n\"People are people. We are all human, we all have feelings. So be kind.\"",

Please stay safe and save lives.\"\nAt the end of each working week, Nisra releases data on the number of deaths in Northern Ireland where Covid-19 was mentioned on the death certificate.\nNisra's most recent statistics show that by Friday 12 June, there had been 802 deaths where coronavirus was mentioned on the death certificate.\nThe Department of Health's death toll refers to patients who have died with 28 days of testing positive for Covid-19, whether or no the infection was the cause of their death.

        "description": "The number of people using canal tow-paths has increased by almost 200% in urban areas since lockdown began.\nOn a narrow tow-path, social distancing is difficult to achieve but for those with limited access to green spaces it is often one of their few options.  \nSome canal visitors in Birmingham said they were once an \"escape\" but edging past others filled them with anxiety.\nThe Canal and River Trust has urged people to limit their use of the waterways which remain open for all.\n\"Living in the city centre, canals have always been my escape,\" Ruth Millington, who lives in a studio flat in Birmingham's Jewellery Quarter, said.\nShe has no garden and relies on the city's extensive canal network for exercise and stress-relief. \"It's so important for my mental health,\" she said.\nWith famously more canals than Venice, it is no surprise the waterways are significant to the people of Birmingham.\nThe Canal and River Trust reported that, since lockdown came into force on 23 March, the number of people using the canals in inner-city Birmingham had increased by 171% - from a daily average of 463 to 1,254.\nFor Ms Millington, the increase has meant her outdoor activity has had an adverse effect on her mental health instead of a positive one.\n\"I've found my usual walk along the canal stressful because the paths are so busy and this has added to my anxiety,\" she said.\n\"The narrow paths can't accommodate all of the cyclists, runners, dog walkers and groups of people walking together.\"\nThe Canal and River Trust charity reported a \"shift in usage\" from busy tourist hotspots in favour of less-used tow-paths in residential areas, \"often amongst less affluent communities where green space is often at a premium\".\nBurnley, Sandwell and Blackburn have seen the greatest increase in visitors to the canal network, while the number of visitors to canals in tourist hotspots such as Camden, Paddington and Birmingham's Brindley Place has dropped by more than half.\nA growing body of research links parks and green spaces to wellbeing, although millions of people in the UK do not have access to parks or green spaces nearby.\n\"My mental health is really suffering from being inside,\" Ms Millington said, adding she was now having to balance the risk of not being able to social distance against the impact on her wellbeing.\nIt is a balance the Canal and River Trust is deeply conscious of.\nThe charity put up signage across its network encouraging people to limit their use of tow-paths but said it was working to manage social distancing without cutting off access to green space from those least likely to have gardens or live near parks.\n\"Our canals provide, for many people, a vital green or blue route on-their-doorstep, but people must limit their use and act considerately at this time,\" the trust's chief executive Richard Parry said.\n\"Canals can be a lifeline for people, but only if we use them responsibly.\"\nRaj Sanghera has just bought a house which backs on to the Birmingham New Main Line canal.\nHe said the canal had become his main access route into town and, since lockdown, a place he took trips out.\n\"We've really embraced canal life.\"\nHe said he had noticed \"a massive increase in people\" using the tow-paths and so has had to change his habits to better maintain social distancing.\n\"It puts me off going at 'peak times',\" the keen runner said. \"I'm getting up earlier to go out to avoid people.\"\nThe number of visitors is exacerbated by the fact only one side of the canal is paved, he said, forcing the majority of people on to one side of the tow-path where they are further restricted by overgrown shrubbery.\nFor boater Tim Morley, the increase in people using tow-paths has been noticeable - on some days they have been akin to \"a motorway\", he said.\nHe lives with his partner on a boat in Hockley Port, a section of canal off Birmingham's Soho Loop near the Jewellery Quarter.\n\"We've been trying to exercise every day and the tow-path is the natural place to do it,\" he said.\nBut the network was \"never designed for that volume of people,\" he said, and he has instead taken to walking around local industrial estates to avoid people using the tow-paths.\n\"My partner thinks I'm mad but I think they're fascinating,\" he said. \n\"We don't want to be near people but we also want to offer space to people who live in flats and only have access to the canals for a couple of hours a day.\"\nMr Morley, who works all over the world as an academic facilitator, has been living on a boat for three years.\nPart of the advice issued by the Canal and River Trust was for pedestrians and cyclists to avoid areas where boats are moored to protect boaters.\n\"When you're moored, you're inches from the tow-path,\" Mr Morley said, but added Hockley Port was closed to members of the public, \"so we don't really get people walking past us\".\nThe Canal and River Trust said it wanted people to continue using the network, \"to enjoy the benefits of spending time by water\".\n\"We're just asking that they be responsible and considerate when doing so.\"\nFollow BBC West Midlands on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

        "description": "The coronavirus lockdown forced many people in Northern Ireland to work from home - but with schools closed, a lot of parents have also had to look after their children at the same time.\nWith some sectors of the economy now reopening, what childcare is available for parents who are expected to return to their place of work?\nHere's a guide to the latest guidance in Northern Ireland, and what it means for parents and providers.\nAt the start of the pandemic, some schools and other childcare settings stayed open on a limited basis, for parents classed as key workers, and vulnerable children.\nThose restrictions have not changed, but earlier this month the definition of a key worker was widened by the Departments of Health and Education.\nThis was to pre-empt more parents returning to jobs in retail, with the sector allowed to fully reopen from 12 June.\nThe full list of key workers can be seen here.\nHowever from 1 July, that list is set to be scrapped to allow more parents to access childcare, ahead of the hospitality and hair/beauty sectors opening on 3 and 6 July respectively.\nNot all of them can open yet.\nThere are 344 day nurseries in Northern Ireland, about 80% of which are private businesses, according to the Early Years Organisation.\nIt is estimated more than nine in 10 nurseries and day-care providers closed in late March, because of the reduction in numbers of children attending.\nTo reopen, centres must have demand for at least 25% of the overall number of registered places or 15 vulnerable children or those of key workers. However, that will change at the start of July.\nThere are also currently restrictions on group sizes to minimise the spread of the virus.\nThe Departments of Health and Education, which both have responsibility for childcare, have advised day-care centres to organise children in \"play pods\".\nFirst Minister Arlene Foster said there were \"no plans\" to limit the numbers of children that day-care centres can admit from 1 July.\nHowever the departments say play pods of children should be as small as possible, limited to 12 children and with the same members of staff assigned each day.\nLynda Courtney runs a day-care centre in Moygashel, County Tyrone, which is preparing to reopen in the next fortnight.\nShe said she feels very positive about resuming business, but advised parents that the centres will look different.\n\"We've had to remove soft furnishings and some toys, and there are now more entrances and exits,\" said Mrs Courtney.\n\"A lot of parents are anxious that their child can't be lifted up or even touched, but the play pods will make it feel like they've their own little family in day care.\n\"We've had to think outside the box and look at ways of changing, but we've adapted.\"\nYes, but they can also only accept vulnerable children and those of key workers, although this will change from 1 July.\nThere are about 2,700 self-employed, registered childminders in Northern Ireland. Just over 1,100 continued to work during the lockdown.\nCurrently, they can look after the children of three families at one time, according to government guidance.\nThis can increase to four families at the one time from 29 June and to five families in August - subject to medical and scientific advice.\nPatricia Lewsley-Mooney of the Northern Ireland Childminding Association welcomed that decision, but said more still needs to be done.\n\"We need to be talking to the Department for the Economy with regard to employers being a bit more understanding when it comes to employees' access to childcare,\" she said.\n\"We're hearing anecdotally that some parents are being told if they do not go back to work by Monday, there could be disciplinary processes in place.\n\"It's not that they don't want to go back to work, but it may be too short notice, or they're not on a childminder's list or their childminder can't take more kids.\"\nFrom 12 June, places of worship and community centres have been allowed to open to provide childcare, following a decision taken by the executive.\nBut questions remain about staffing of the facilities, and how many hours they will open per day.\nThe Executive Office says a specific childcare recovery plan will be published to restore the sector to pre-Covid-19 levels \"as quickly and safely as possible to enable working parents to return to their places of employment\".\nPlans are also being made to open summer schemes on a limited basis, children with educational needs and the children of key workers will be prioritised.\nPre-lockdown, many parents would have relied on grandparents for help with childcare.\nFamilies are still not permitted to visit each other indoors, so many people will not be able to go down this route.\nHowever, adults who live alone can join a support bubble.\nA grandparent who lives alone could potentially form a bubble with one of their children, which means they could go to see them and interact with their grandchildren.\nAbout 350,000 workers in Northern Ireland have dependent children, according to the Nevin Economic Research Institute (NERI).\nIts research suggests 70% of them are likely to have \"intensive childcare requirements\". \nChildcare was not specifically mentioned in the executive's five-step Pathway to Recovery plan, but Ms Lewsley-Mooney said she recognised the executive is now focusing on the issue.\n\"Childcare is a lynchpin for the whole economy,\" she added.\nThe Departments of Health and Education say parents seeking childcare should consult the Family Support NI website to find out what is available in their area.\nA helpline is also available on 0808 8020 400, where an early years team within the local health trust can provide advice on childcare solutions in a parent's area.",

        "title": "'Why I want to go to lockdown raves'",
        "description": "Police forces across England are gearing up to tackle illegal lockdown raves after receiving tip offs about weekend events. But why do people want to go to raves during a pandemic?\nThe risk of serious illness from the spread of coronavirus was not enough to stop 6,000 people gathering at two raves in Manchester last weekend.\nAt these events one man died, three people were stabbed and a woman was raped. \nPolice forces across England have warned they will be using dogs and drones to find raves and anyone taking part risks being arrested.\nGatherings of more than six people outdoors are illegal under new coronavirus laws but Jay, 22, has been going to warehouse parties.\n\"I live in a warehouse with five other people,\" he said. \"We are part of a warehouse collective of creatives who are fashion designers, set designers, performance artists, dancers, photographers. There are about 50 people in our WhatsApp group who live in warehouses within our area.\n\"In the beginning everyone was being very regimented and sticking with the rules. But as time went on every couple of weeks we would meet in one of the warehouses or studio spaces where we could set up the DJ decks. Sometimes it could go up to 30 people.\n\"We're not staying 2m apart so it's kind of like breaking the rules because we know we are taking a risk. But we would go away and spend two weeks quarantining with only the people we live with. We wouldn't see everyone again for another two weeks and everyone was doing the same.\n\"We won't let random people in. We would know if someone had been to another party because we are all part of the same network. No-one has had any symptoms or become unwell.  None of us have been able to be in contact with any of our family members so we can't spread it to them.\n\"[It's] escapism from being trapped in this whole time which has been getting really daunting.\n\"The rave community is such a community of misfits and people who don't fit into society, who may suffer from anxiety or other mental health issues. So there's this urge for them to want to be together, for them to have contact with other people so when we come out of this we aren't going to be socially inept. That's the excuse. \n\"If people can go to the park and sit close together then why can't we do this? We know it's breaking the rules, that's why we keep it so secret but there's no stopping us from doing it. People are having people over to their houses for drinks so it's hypocritical to say we can't do this.\n\"We've not been to any big organised raves but that's because we don't know of any. If I did then I would go.\"\nThe father of an 18-year-old who was stabbed at one of the illegal raves in Daisy Nook and Carrington in Greater Manchester said his son will regret attending \"for the rest of his life\".\nThe parent, who has asked not to be named, told BBC Radio Manchester his son was \"dying in a field\" as officers tried to find him.\n\"These events aren't safe, there's no cameras, no security because of where it was and the inaccessibility. They had to do amazing things just to get to him to save him.\"\nOllie, 21, was at the rave in Daisy Nook and said: \"I would say to anyone thinking of going to a lockdown rave '100% don't go'.\"\nHe and his friends followed crowds to the rave out of curiosity but left after witnessing \"horrific\" violence and drug taking.\n\"We went for a walk around the student area and everybody was saying about this illegal rave going on,\" he said.\n\"You could hear the music booming so we followed the sound about 10 minutes out of the built up area through woods and land.\n\"I'm not even kidding there were thousands of people, it was unbelievable to see. It was really, really terrible. I go to normal raves all the time and this was like nothing else.\n\"Everyone was going absolutely crazy. Everyone was on drugs, there was no security or authority there. There was this tension in the air and so many really bad fights. I witnessed this man get absolutely beaten.\n\"You would hear screams all the time. People were sniffing coke, doing balloons, dropping pills. The people there were so rough and off their face they wouldn't be allowed into a normal festival or club. But here there's no-one to protect you.\n\"It seems all fun but it takes one little thing to start and it gets very nasty, very quickly. There's no social distancing, people were having sex and all sorts. It will have spread the virus definitely.\n\"We spent about half an hour watching from the sidelines and we thought 'let's go'. But getting out was a nightmare because people there were passed out everywhere or being sick, there was a guy having a fit on the floor.\"\nAnyone attending an illegal rave this weekend risks being arrested and prosecuted, police forces have warned.\nWest Midlands Police said it had received a tip off that a music event was planned for a remote part of the Black Country on Saturday.\nSupt Nick Rowe, from the force, said: \"Events like this are illegal. They are unacceptable at any time but even more so during a pandemic in which large gatherings are banned to help stop the spread of a killer virus.\"\nIt is a crime to hold gatherings of two or more people indoors or more than six people outdoors, under England's coronavirus legislation.\nGatherings of as many as six people from different households can take place outdoors - such as in parks or gardens - in England, so long as people remain 2m (6ft 6in) apart.\nSocial distancing is important because the nearer you are to someone who is infected, the greater the risk of catching the virus.",

        "title": "'Having my identity stolen cost me £10,000'",
        "description": "\"It just seemed to go on and on, it's just been really upsetting.\" Gemma Combellack, 30, is talking about her six month fight to reclaim her identity after it was stolen by criminals last year.\nShe discovered she'd become a victim of ID theft when she was refused a mortgage over a payday loan in her name that she knew nothing about.\nA bank account had also been opened by fraudsters using her identity.\n\"I've been in tears at my desk at work in terms of the impact it's had on me and my stress levels.\n\"At the time it made me so angry, the fact that we were having to go through all this trauma and stress and no one could give me answer.\n\"It's just that it was so out of our control and that's the most frustrating thing about it.\"\nGemma's not alone. Last year ID theft happened more than 223,000 times, up 18% on the year before, according to Cifas, the counter fraud organisation which runs the National Fraud Database and works with police and financial institutions to try to tackle fraud.\n'Lucrative business'\nIts chief executive, Mike Haley, says there are a number of factors fuelling that rise.\n\"Criminals are using more sophisticated methods, more of us are doing more things online and we're all using cash less which is something fraudsters are able to exploit.\n\"Criminals are targeting ID fraud as a lucrative business model and they're getting sophisticated in their use of social engineering [on the phone, text messages or on social media] which involves persuading people to give up personal information,\" Mr Haley said.\nCombined with large scale data breaches and data theft from companies and organisations, \"and you have the raw ingredients [for ID theft],\" he added.\nVery often criminals carrying out these attacks on people in the UK aren't even based here. \"This can all be done at a distance,\" he said. \"Now you can sit behind a computer anywhere in the world and commit crime on a vast scale.\"\nAlso, there is very little risk of getting caught as \"criminals are able to use the anonymity of the internet,\" he said.\n2015: 169,592\n2016: 172,918\n2017: 174,523\n2018: 189,108\n2019: 223,163\nCifas\nFor Gemma, the personal cost of having her identity stolen ran into thousands of pounds. \"In terms of the financial implications we weren't able to get a mortgage and therefore had to continue to pay rent on our property for six months.\n\"We'd also instructed a solicitor and had the flat valued so, overall, the costs are looking at the £10,000 mark.\n\"It just feels like I haven't progressed in nine months. It feels like we've just been really financially hit by something that was completely out of our hands, and it just seems really unfair.\"\nGemma's also worried about her financial future.\n\"If it can happen once it can happen again,\" she said. \"It's made me really, really nervous about it happening again because there are no signs, you don't know it's happening to you.\"\nMike Haley says he expects the number of ID thefts to be even higher this year and next as criminals look to exploit people's vulnerabilities during the coronavirus pandemic.\nHe said: \"During this period criminals haven't taken a holiday, they've been using this time to harvest information.\n\"They've been upping their activity to capitalise on the crisis, we all have our guard down because, understandably, we're all worried about other things.\nThe advice from experts is always avoid clicking on links or replying to text messages and phone calls that come out of the blue.\nThere is also a national campaign trying to raise awareness of fraud and advice for people on how they can try to help themselves to avoid becoming a victim.\nYou can hear more on BBC Radio 4's Money Box programme by listening again here.\nFollow Money Box and Dan on Twitter.",

        "title": "Will Santa have to social distance this year?",
        "description": "The coronavirus pandemic has already seen off Easter parties and summer festivals - will Christmas outings suffer the same fate? \nIt may be June but lots of parents of young children will tell you Christmas planning starts early if you want to get tickets booked to your favourite Santa experience or pantomime.\nBut while many events have started taking bookings, the question remains whether or not they will go ahead if social distancing remains in place or the virus has a second peak.\nA visit to a grotto, Christmas show or winter fair is an annual tradition for many families but the magic may feel somewhat lost if Santa has to wear a mask.\nSome venues have already cancelled their festive events such as the Telford Steam Railway. The heritage line organises a Polar Express train service each year where families board a train decorated like the one in the animated film.\nThe trips attract hundreds of people, many of whom travel from faraway for the event. It is also a major fundraiser for the line which saw turnover go from £100,000 a year to more than £1m.\nA statement from the board of directors said it would be \"irresponsible to put any lives at risk\".\n\"This is one of the hardest decisions we have had to make as this event has a massive impact to our railway business, but the health of you and your family is more important to us especially around the festive period.\"\nOther cancelled events include the Christmas light switch on in Ely and the Whitby Christmas festival. However other venues are taking bookings for Christmas events such as Legoland in Windsor and the Snowdome in Tamworth, which hosts Santa's Winter Wonderland every year. \nOrganisers are yet to make a decision on festive markets such as the Frankfurt Christmas market held in Birmingham. \nIt's not that surprising that events like Christmas fairs which attract large groups of people in close proximity might be off the table but what about the annual visit to Santa. Will we see elves in PPE and will St Nick, as an older gentleman, have to shield in the North Pole?\nNot according to Matthew Wise, managing director of Great Grottos, which runs more than 200 grottos in shopping and garden centres across the UK.\nHe said: \"Great Grottos expects the Christmas grotto to move away from enclosed structures towards more expansive open staged settings with decorative backdrops.\"\nHe said this will allow staff and guests to social distance safely.\n\"If the downward trend in Covid-19 cases continues, garden centre grottos may prove to be the likely winners. They are able to delay their decision making on Christmas until the latest point and react more immediately.\"\nHe added grotto managers will be watching the retail sector for the next month now that non-essential shops have reopened to see how consumers and retailers behave post lockdown.\nIn the meantime the recruitment of 500 Santas and elves has been pushed back to later in the year and some Father Christmases may audition via video call or using sanitised interviewing conditions.\nCould the drive-in cinema finally take off in the UK?\nWhat to expect when hairdressers reopen\nWhat will a post-lockdown high street look like?\nAt theatres, crowds, artists and stagehands may find the annual pantomime is a very different experience going forward. \nIn Chesham, the Bucks Free Press reported that the local panto has been changed from Snow White to Sleeping Beauty to reduce the number of performers backstage.\nMartin Dodd, producer and managing director of UK Productions, said the usual business of auditions, set building and costume making is on hold for his 10 scheduled shows.\n\"We work on pantomimes all year round in our workshops and warehouses as well as casting, marketing, writing scripts and designing new productions,\" he said. \n\"But with all of our premises closed and most of our staff furloughed this has obviously not been possible.\"\nAuditions for ensemble members and juveniles are usually held from Easter with principal performers cast in July but while first round auditions can be done via video it is more difficult to put teams of dancers together while maintaining social distancing rules. \nMr Dodd added: \"However the biggest question mark over Christmas is whether theatres will be able to open and whether we will be able to guarantee that we can keep the show on. \n\"Social distancing rules, even if it were to come down to one metre, means the theatres and producers will be losing money, but equally worrying is the risk of having to quarantine a whole company or theatre, which could mean cancellations of two weeks for every case. \n\"Such a scenario would simply be unsustainable financially for us as producers and also for the theatre.\"\nIn May the Department for Culture, Media and Sport announced the appointment of a Commissioner for Cultural Recovery and Renewal to support the sector's recovery from the pandemic.\nMr Dodd said the industry needed financial support \"both in terms of reduced audience numbers and as insurance against quarantine/isolation losses and/or a return to lockdown\", as well as guidelines on how to rehearse safely. \nThere is also the cultural impact to consider, often pantomime is an introduction to the theatre for new and young audiences, adds Mr Dodd. \n\"Pantomimes are also so special in that they provide a way of bringing young and old together in a way not seen in any other country and given the isolation and separation felt by so many families this year wouldn't it be great if the family trip to the pantomime could still happen?\"",

        "title": "How does the UK's death toll compare with other countries?",
        "description": "The UK currently has the third highest number of recorded coronavirus deaths in the world. Only the United States and Brazil have had more, and both countries have far bigger populations.\nBut while the UK has been hit hard, how does it really rank alongside other countries?\nJust comparing Covid-19 deaths doesn't give the full picture as countries have different ways of recording deaths. Scientists and ministers say it's better to look at total deaths, even the ones that aren't caused by coronavirus.\nSo what can we learn about the UK's toll if we look at it this way? \nPeru has registered very few coronavirus deaths so far compared with the UK.  But the total number of deaths tells a different story. \nBoth countries have seen a huge spike in deaths, with the weekly number peaking at more than double what would be expected had there not been a pandemic. That expected number of deaths is shown by the dashed line. \nThere is a similar pattern in Chile and Ecuador - a large rise in the total number of deaths that is missed if you look only at \"Covid deaths\". \nSince the total number of deaths registered in a week normally follows a predictable pattern, scientists use the extra deaths seen during the pandemic to estimate mortalities caused by the pandemic.\nThis captures the misdiagnosed deaths, but it also includes the deaths caused by the strain the virus puts on a society.\n\"These deaths likely would not have happened if the pandemic had not happened and they should be counted in the death toll,\" says Stéphane Helleringer, a demographer at Johns Hopkins University. \nWhile Peru's death rates have not started to fall, in some countries they have reverted to normal or near-normal levels. This allows us to start to assess who has been worst hit in the first wave of the epidemic. \nCountries such as Denmark, Norway or Germany have had a very different first wave of the epidemic to the UK. \nThe pattern of deaths in those countries doesn't have the same spike as in the UK. Comparisons based on total death figures are \"not definitive\", says Dr Veena Raleigh, of the King's Fund health think tank. \"But the caveats are unlikely to alter radically the relative standing of countries like the UK compared to those who have seen far fewer deaths.\"\nNorway and Denmark are smaller countries. And population density, or how crowded and global a country's cities are, will affect the spread of a virus. Also, the age and health of those infected will make a difference to how many people die. \nBut the actions taken make a difference too. \n\"The speed and strength of each country's response to control initial spreading events and develop the testing capacity needed for operational surveillance seem to have played an important role,\" says Royal Statistical Society president-elect Sylvia Richardson.\nBut, she adds: \"It will not be easy to disentangle the effect of a specific measure.\" \nThe UK is not alone in being hit hard. Italy, Spain and Belgium have also seen at least a third more deaths than they would have expected.\nAnd that means many tens of thousands of deaths for each of the UK, Italy and Spain. \nIt is easy to change the rankings of these countries by using slightly different methods.\nIn the first four weeks, for example:\nBut by any measure, the UK consistently appears in this unhappy club of countries hardest hit so far. Even before the pandemic, the UK's life expectancy was lower than in many other western European countries and showed the least improvement from 2011 to 2018. \nAnd the UK \"risks a further slide down life-expectancy tables\", according to Dr Raleigh, underlining the need to make comparisons with other countries, even with imperfect data. \n\"You work with what you've got, provided you know the cautions that come with it,\" she says.",

        "description": "There have been calls for political unity following a series of sectarian incidents in a council-owned park in north Belfast.\nPoliticians have said a group of men at Grove Playing Fields on Thursday night told people wearing Gaelic games jerseys and football tops to leave. \nA banner saying \"Anti British GAA not welcome\" was placed at the park last weekend.\nThe same message was spray-painted in the grounds. \nThey were removed by council and are being treated as a hate crime by police.\nThe GAA (Gaelic Athletic Association) is an organisation that oversees Gaelic games, including Gaelic football and hurling, across the island of Ireland. \nA north Belfast GAA member, who did not want to be identified, told BBC News NI the experience has been \"intimidating\". \n\"The fact that people have been chased off with their children, some as young as seven years of age, I mean no seven-year-old child, whether they're wearing a GAA top or a Northern Ireland top, they're no threat to anyone. \n\"This isn't even a club, it's parents and their kids getting fresh air and exercise. \n\"It's very damaging to the whole community, because in recent years there has been so much goodwill built up from all sides of the community. \n\"I don't think this is representative of the community.\"\nSinn Féin MLA Gerry Kelly said: \"To say it's just anti-GAA is actually not correct. Unfortunately, this is sectarian and it's anti-Catholic. \n\"We've reached out to politicians across north Belfast, we need to work together to de-escalate this.\"\nBelfast Deputy Lord Mayor Paul McCusker said: \"As a council, we need to make sure that all our parks are shared spaces. \n\"People are using parks across the city to train and come together gradually after Covid.\"\nThe SDLP councillor added: \"It's very concerning that this possibly could have been orchestrated. \n\"All political parties need to come together to say we cannot tolerate this and it must not continue.\"\nIn a statement, DUP councillor Dean McCullough said there had been a series of sectarian incidents in the area over the past eight weeks. \nHe said residents have been \"verbally abused and felt intimidated\". \n\"Anti-unionist writing and contentious flags have also been placed in Grove Park. \n\"Grove Park is a public park and is open to all. All forms of intimidation are wrong and we condemn them outright. No one should feel targeted or harassed because of their religion.\"\nIn a statement, Belfast City Council said it was aware of \"an incident\" that took place at Grove Playing Fields on Thursday evening. \nThe council said its parks \"are shared spaces for everyone to enjoy\" and encouraged anyone who witnesses such incidents to report them to police. \nPSNI Insp Paul Noble said: \"Due to a number of reports of incidents at the Grove Playing Fields over the last week, police have been maintaining a presence in the area and carrying out regular patrols through the playing fields.\n\"Police will continue to pay particular attention to the area with regular patrols in the days ahead and will continue to liaise with partner agencies and local representatives.\"",

        "title": "Fears some pupils will miss out over school changes",
        "description": "There are fears some of Wales' most vulnerable children will not be seen by teachers after a row means some schools will only reopen for three weeks.\nOn Monday, June 29, children will start heading back to the classroom for a \"check in\" before the summer break.\nBut some councils will not extend the summer term by a week, after contract talks with unions, local authorities and the Welsh Government stalled.\nOne headteacher said it would leave children vulnerable over the holidays.\nKerina Hanson, vice-president of the National Association of Head Teachers, said many teachers would be \"feeling they made a promise to parents and now we are breaking that promise\".\nMeanwhile the Welsh Conservatives criticised the Welsh Government saying the decision on whether to extend term-time had been \"pushed on councils, forcing them to take the heat\".\nSchools have been open throughout the coronavirus lockdown, but only for pupils classed as vulnerable and for children of key workers.\nOn 29 June, a phased return to the classroom will start, but with smaller classes, staggered starts, and breaks, it is thought it will take some time for all pupils to go back.\nEducation Minister Kirsty Williams had said that all children would have the opportunity to \"check in, catch up, prepare for summer and September\", and had hoped to extend the summer term by a week to give schools time.\nBut there has been an ongoing negotiations between some unions, the Welsh Government and education authorities over the plans.\nConcerns had been raised that contract issues meant there would not be enough support staff available - including cleaners and teaching assistants - to enable schools to remain open for the extra week.\nA number of local authorities, who are in charge of schools, have now said they will not extend term, including Cardiff, Newport, Monmouthshire, Caerphilly, Wrexham and Blaenau Gwent, where schools will finish on the original end of term 17 July date.\nSo far, only Conwy has confirmed its schools will return for four weeks. While Rhondda Cynon Taf council has emailed head teachers stating it is minded to open for the fourth week and asking which staff would like to volunteer to work.\nMeanwhile in Anglesey, schools will not reopen on 29 June, after a coronavirus outbreak at a food factory.\nKerina Hanson, head teacher of a school in Swansea, said teachers were very concerned about children who may have become vulnerable during lockdown.\nShe said keeping schools open for an extra week would give time for all pupils - whose parents choose to send them in - to get into the classroom.\n\"We have seen the most vulnerable, we have been able to keep in touch with those, but we are just very concerned about those children that may have become vulnerable over the last few months,\" she said.\n\"We really feel this would have been a fantastic time for us ensure we could have caught up with all children, this was a wellbeing catch up and a chance for all children to return to school to see what it would look like when they come back in September.\n\"I think many of us will be feeling that we have made a promise to parents, and now schools are going back, and now we are going to be breaking that promise, because those last few days will not be there for all children.\"\nCardiff parent Chris Lawrence said the latest developments had been \"frustrating\".\nThe father of three boys said \"it was a surprise\" to receive a text message on Friday evening telling him his children would not be going to school for the fourth week.\n\"The challenge is we were building up for the four weeks,\" he said.\n\"As a parent you try to plan as far ahead as possible with your children, at a time of uncertainty such as this.\n\"We were gearing up for a long summer holiday - obviously it's a now going to be a week longer.\"\nThe Welsh Conservatives criticised ministers saying the decision had been \"pushed on councils, forcing them to take the heat\".\nThe Tories' education spokesperson Suzy Davies MS accused the Welsh Government of \"dither and delay\" over the plans.\n\"Either it is important for our children to get four weeks access to schools or it's not,\" she said.\n\"That's the Welsh Government's call and families' choice.\"\nShe added: \"Instead of making the tough decisions and giving some leadership to schools, parents and students the Welsh Government has pushed this decision onto councils, forcing them to take the heat.\"\nThe Welsh Government said: \"As the Conservatives know, local authorities employ staff and we acknowledge it is ultimately for them to decide on whether schools will reopen for three weeks, rather than four. \n\"While we continue to recommend four weeks of 'check in, catch up and prepare', we acknowledge that ultimately this is a decision for local authorities, who are the employers of school staff.\"",

        "description": "Police are searching for an attacker who punched and kicked a 75-year-old man in the head on a riverside path.\nDerek Brailsford was walking alongside the River Leen in Bulwell, Nottingham, when he was set upon on 13 June.\nHe was kicked five times, leaving him with severe facial bruising and difficulty seeing out of one eye.\nMr Brailsford believes his assailant, who was on a scooter, was angry that he did not have enough space to ride past.\nHe said: \"I was walking along and I saw someone coming, at quite a pace on one of those electric scooters.\n\"I don't remember exactly what he said - something about getting out of the way - but I got punched to the floor and kicked.\n\"It came out of nowhere. I had tried to make room on the path but if I had stepped away any more I would have been down the bank and into the river.\n\"Just before this I had overtaken two people - who stepped aside for me - and they saw the whole thing.\n\"I even said to the man 'Look there are witnesses' and he said 'but they don't have cameras.'\"\nHe said the attack had left him scared.\n\"I am usually very active and independent. However I am frightened of walking alone on a pathway now as I feel that this could happen to me again,\" he said.\n\"I am scared that this person may find me and hurt me again.\"\nNottinghamshire Police described the assault as \"a completely unprovoked attack with an unknown offender\".\nThe attacker is described as a black or mixed race male in his teens or early 20s with a gold tooth and star tattoo on his neck.\nFollow BBC East Midlands on Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram.

It called on governments to respond by increasing efforts to extend social protections to those people, like maids and nannies, whose work often occurs beyond the reach of government rules.\nBut the response so far doesn't bode well for those efforts.

        "title": "UK set to relax quarantine rule for some countries",
        "description": "The government is planning to relax its travel quarantine rules in early July for some countries.\nUK officials are talking to their counterparts in Portugal, France, Italy, Greece and Spain. \nHowever, the UK hopes to make an announcement on 29 June that it has secured a number of \"travel corridors\". \nThe government had previously said that the quarantine would be reviewed every three weeks and 29 June marks the end of the first three-week period. \nA travel corridor would mean that two people travelling in both directions between two countries would not have to self-isolate after they travel.\nThe first travel corridors could come into force on 4 July, although that date is by no means confirmed. \nEven if certain routes are exempt, the  travel quarantine for people arriving from other destinations will remain in place. \nA senior aviation source has told the BBC that the quarantine could remain throughout the summer for anyone arriving from countries which do not have a travel corridor with the UK.  \nPortugal's foreign minister previously said that anyone in the UK thinking of going to Portugal this summer would be \"most welcome\" despite the coronavirus pandemic. \nAugusto Santos Silva said he hoped an \"air bridge\" between the UK and Portugal could be secured by the end of June.\nHowever, the broader travel quarantine is expected to remain in place. \nFor more on the rules click here.\nAnyone arriving from the Republic of Ireland, the Channel Islands or the Isle of Man does not have to complete a form or enter quarantine upon arrival in the UK.\nThere are also exemptions for workers in some industries such as road haulage and medical professionals who are providing essential care.\nThe travel industry has been vocal in its criticism of the government's quarantine rules, warning that the isolation period will deter visitors and put jobs at risk. Some airlines were in the early stages of legal action.\nThe manufacturing industry has also highlighted that fewer flights will restrict imports and exports, which will have a knock-on effect for the freight industry, as well as hampering the recovery of some businesses.\nDespite criticism from businesses, Home Secretary Priti Patel said that the measures were \"proportionate\" and being implemented \"at the right time\" when they came into effect on 8 June.",

        "title": "UK debt now larger than size of whole economy",
        "description": "The UK's debt is now worth more than its economy after the government borrowed a record amount in May. \nThe £55.2bn figure was nine times higher than in May last year and the highest since records began in 1993.\nThe borrowing splurge sent total government debt surging to £1.95trn, exceeding the size of the economy for the first time in more than 50 years.\nChancellor Rishi Sunak said the figures confirmed the severe impact the virus was having on public finances.\n\"The best way to restore our public finances to a more sustainable footing is to safely reopen our economy so people can return to work. \n\"We've set out our plan to do this in a gradual and safe fashion, including reopening high streets across the country this week, as we kickstart our economic recovery,\" he added.\nIncome from tax, National Insurance and VAT all dived in May amid the coronavirus lockdown as spending on support measures soared.\nThis is the first time debt has been larger than the size of the economy since 1963, but it is not as high as the post-war peak of 258% in 1946-47.\nThe deficit - the difference between spending and tax income - for the first two months of the financial year (April and May) is now estimated to have been £103.7bn, £87bn more than in the same period last year, another record. \nBut the ONS estimates borrowing for the 2020-21 financial year will dwarf that at £298bn. That would be the largest deficit since World War Two. \nIt cautioned that due to the coronavirus, its official estimates were subject to greater than usual uncertainty.\nThe Office for National Statistics had previously said that April's borrowing figure was the highest since records began in 1993, but it subsequently revised the figure down to £48.5bn from £62bn.\nThe revision was due to higher than expected income from taxes and national insurance, as well as the spending on the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme being lower than originally estimated.\nAlex Tuckett, senior economist at consultants PwC, pointed to the 46% fall in the amount of VAT collected in the month, although it said the biggest issue for the government's finances was the £29bn it spent on the various support schemes for the economy.\n\"In the near term, there are signs the economy is recovering as the country re-opens, and this should boost tax receipts. \n\"However, these figures remind us that Chancellor Rishi Sunak faces a difficult backdrop to any summer fiscal event.\"\nSamuel Tombs at Pantheon Economics said the emergency support measures had placed a \"colossal burden\" on the public finances. \nIn a release packed with striking figures, he singled out the fact the government had needed to raise more cash in the first two months of this fiscal year than in total in any prior 10 fiscal years. \nBusting the overdraft, with a borrowing figure nine times as high as a year ago is not an easy thing for any government to swallow. In his first full year as Chancellor, Rishi Sunak is on track for the biggest public sector deficit since World War Two, \nBut it is, he reckons, a price worth paying to prevent a bigger cost to the economy, in terms of lost jobs and output. Billions have been pumped into supporting millions of jobs, and many businesses, while, on the other side, tax receipts have plunged. Those lifelines will be wound down in the coming months, and the government can borrow cheaply on financial markets to fund them.  \nBut what happens next? As lockdown is eased, the Treasury is watching closely, knowing the recovery may need extra support - perhaps tax cuts or more spending. That will present the government with more bills - but failing to provide more help risks an even higher cost. \nThe chancellor is to present some sort of statement before Parliament ceases for the summer in July - that won't be a full Budget but may contain some measures to boost the recovery.  The tough choices aren't over yet. ",

        "title": "UK plans to keep post-Brexit trade with EU flowing",
        "description": "The way British businesses trade with the European Union is set to change fundamentally at the end of the year. \nThe UK left the EU on 31 January but remains in the single market and customs union until 31 December, while the two sides try to hammer out a trade agreement.\nThe end of the so-called transition period in December will mean EU rules will no longer directly apply in Great Britain and the goods trade between them will be governed by new rules. \nBut these will only be introduced gradually.\nLast week, the government announced that relaxed controls will apply for goods coming into the UK from the EU for a period of six months. \nThese will apply whether the UK and the EU conclude a free trade agreement before the end of the year or not. \nUnlike last year, when the difference between a deal and \"no deal\" was the difference between continuing the same arrangements and a sudden reset of the two sides' trading relationship, the gap between the two outcomes is smaller.\nBut many of the challenges are the same.\nSo what are the new rules that will apply at the end of the transition and why are they being implemented?\nThe temporary regime announced by the government applies to goods arriving into the UK via ports like Dover.\nAnd they apply only to trade directly between the EU and Great Britain, not Northern Ireland.\nTrade across the land border between Republic and Northern Ireland, and Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK is covered by the special arrangements under the withdrawal agreement.\nThe Northern Ireland protocol, as it is known, applies until the UK and the EU agree to replace it or the devolved assembly at Stormont votes to end it.\nUnless special procedures apply, traders normally have to submit customs documentation that lists information about their goods they are importing and pay any tariffs or duties that are due up front at the border. \nBut under the government's plan, the requirement to do this would be put on hold for up to six months after import. \nBusinesses would keep a record of what goods they had imported in their books and pay the tariffs due subsequently. \nThe government says this is designed to help businesses, with special consideration given to the impact of coronavirus on their ability to prepare. \nBut Dr Anna Jerzewska, an associate fellow at the UK Trade Policy Observatory and an international customs consultant, told the BBC \"the main benefit is to help manage borders\".\nAt \"roll-on roll-off\" ports like Dover, which in normal times manages the movement of approximately 2.5 million lorries moving in both directions, \"speed is crucial,\" she added. \n\"Any delay in terms of the traffic moving on and off the ferry will cause traffic delays. \n\"One thing this announcement does is help to manage that so that everything can be done quickly at the border.\"\nA deal could help ease the demands made on traders and would likely mean that trade between the UK and EU would be completely tariff-free. \nBut goods would still have to prove that they qualify for the tariff exemption and most checks would still apply. \nExtra controls typically apply to plants or animals and the things we make out of them because they pose a larger risk to health.\nThe UK plans to implement these checks for goods coming into the UK from the EU but, much like customs, only after a delay of six months. \nImmediately after the end of transition period, the UK will not be checking most plant and animal products that enter through ports. \nOnly high risk products will be required to submit a notification that they are going to be imported at the start and from April this will apply to all products of animal origin - like meats and honey - as well as plants. \nFor products coming from the EU, this will be the first time that these checks have applied. That comes with its challenges. \nIn a similar way to \"no deal\" Brexit preparations at the end of last year, the concern centres on potential delays created by new checks and disruptions in supply. \n\"For a lot of sensitive products, like poultry, fish and pet food, border control agents will open up the lorry, open up products and undertake inspections and that takes time to come back from the laboratory,\" said Domonic Goudie, the head of international trade at the Food and Drink Federation, an industry body.  \n\"That threatens 'just in time' supply chains but also it starts the clock ticking on product shelf life.\"\nDifficulties are also related to where these checks take place. \nIn the EU, plants and products of animal origin have to enter via border control post where the checks take place and the UK plans to have a similar system.\nMany of the UK's ports lack the correct facilities - or the space - to carry out these checks. \nThe government has committed to building the necessary infrastructure but this will take time. \nSites need to be identified, planning permission granted and facilities built to the right specification.\nAnd where there isn't space for these facilities, such as at Dover, where the town and the port are hemmed in by cliffs, the posts will need to be built inland. \nThe checks necessary to move goods from the UK to the EU are down to European law and the EU's customs code.\nTraders hoping to export their goods to the European Union will have to fill out and submit customs documentation and complete further checks for sensitive goods. \nIn France, customs authorities have devised a pre-notification system for trucks coming from the UK.\nOnly lorries that have the right customs paperwork are allowed to board the ferry in Dover or other ports along the south coast of England. \nWhile on board, goods are matched to the lorries they are on and a colour-coded system tells drivers whether they require further checks: Green for \"no\", orange for \"yes\".\nSome ports are concerned that increases in the time that it takes to check lorries could lead to tailbacks and traffic jams. \nThe possibility that companies not used to completing customs paperwork might turn up at the port without the proper documentation is a further cause for concern.\nIn Portsmouth, port authorities are working to revive plans to triage trucks arriving at the port that were developed for a \"no deal\" Brexit.\nPortsmouth's port director Mike Sellers. said the lack of space - there are just 13 lorry-lengths between the port entry and the motorway slipway - means \"there will still be a need for pre gate checks\".\n\"Triage reduces the risk of a lack of trader awareness and freight turning up at our gate without the right documentation and causing delays.\" \nThe size of the logistical challenge depends to an extent on the volume of traffic, he added. \n\"Predominantly the crossings are booked. As one ferry leaves we don't have one arriving. Were in a good position in terms of resilience.\n\"We don't have the same challenges as Dover or the channel tunnel. They're on a turn-up-and-go basis.\"\nAlongside details of the checks that will apply after the end of the transition period, the government announced that it was pumping a further £50m into preparing the customs intermediaries sector.\nIntermediaries and freight forwarders are the professionals who help guide consignments through customs. \nIt has been estimated that the UK will need another 50,000 customs agents to deal with the potential increase in declarations for imports and exports.\nBut the UK government has said it is not able to estimate how many new customs agents have been hired and it is unclear how close the UK is to matching that target. \nA lack of agents would \"slow everything down\" says Robert Keen, director general of the British International Freight Association, an industry body which represents customs intermediaries. \n\"If the freight volumes were the same this year as they were last year we would certainly need a lot more intermediaries.\n\"But given the coronavirus crisis it is unclear what volume of trade will be moving.\" ",

We are currently working with our partner to review and further evolve all aspects of the brand, including the brand name,\" a Colgate spokesman told the BBC. \nColgate paid $50m (£40m) in 1985 for 50% of Hong Kong-based Hawley & Hazel, the maker of Darlie. The brand controls 17% of the toothpaste market in China, 21% in Singapore, 28% in Malaysia and 25% in Taiwan, according to data firm Euromonitor International.\nOn Wednesday, PepsiCo said it was changing its Aunt Jemima branding, while other food brands featuring African-American characters are reviewing their logos. Mars said it was considering possible changes to the branding of its Uncle Ben's rice, which entered the market in the 1940s.\nRacial injustice is under the spotlight following the death of African-American George Floyd while being detained by police. This sparked demonstrations around the world and gave further impetus to the Black Lives Matter movement. Corporate America has been forced to tackle the issue.\nMany British firms have also been under pressure, including brewer Greene King, Lloyd's of London and banks RBS and Lloyds Banking Group admitting former links to slave trading.",

        "title": "DIY spending splurge helps May sales recover",
        "description": "UK retail sales partly recovered in May, driven by DIY stores and garden centres reopening amid the lockdown.\nThe amount of goods sold last month increased by 12%, in comparison with record falls seen in April, according to the Office for National Statistics.\nSales were boosted by a 42% rise at household goods stores, such as hardware, furniture and paint shops.\nDespite the rebound seen in May, retail sales still remain well below pre-lockdown levels.\nNon-essential retailers in England and Northern Ireland have, however, since been allowed to reopen.\nMost shops in Scotland are to reopen from 29 June. Non-essential retailers in Wales will be told they can reopen from Monday, the first minister is expected to announce on Friday.\nNon-food stores saw the biggest increase in sales last month, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said, with DIY sales providing a bright spot.\n\"According to retailers in this sector, consumers appeared to be carrying out home improvements while spending more time than usual in their homes,\" the ONS said.\nHowever, despite the May boost, sales overall were still down by 13.1% compared with February, before the coronavirus lockdown measures were introduced. \nIn the three months to May, sales fell by 12.8% compared with the previous three months, the fastest quarterly decline since records began in 1996.\nSamuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, cautioned that the \"overall consumer picture remains bleak\".\n\"May's recovery in retail sales should not be interpreted as a sign that the economy is embarking on a healthy V-shaped recovery from Covid-19,\" he said.\n\"Naturally, spending on goods will recover faster than on services, which usually require human contact and remain largely unavailable.\"\nMay's retail sales were always going to be better than the off-the-charts collapse in April, when the full force of the lockdown was underway.\nThe decline is now reversing. But it's far from clear when retail sales will return to pre-Covid-19 levels. \nWhen non-essential shops re-opened in England on Monday, with lots of queues for some of the most popular stores, footfall was still far lower than normal. And with social distancing in place, retailers will have to limit customer numbers where necessary. \nFewer customers will mean fewer sales. With unemployment set to rise and the various government support schemes starting to ebb away, many people's finances will start to come under real pressure. \nOnline sales rose to their highest proportion on record in May while consumers stayed at home. They accounted for 33.4% of total spending, compared with 30.8% in April, the ONS added. \nLynda Petherick, head of retail for Accenture UK and Ireland, said: \"Given the wholesale shifts in consumer behaviour these last few months, it would be optimistic to assume shopping habits will return to normal in the immediate future. \n\"As the proportion of shoppers buying online continues to soar, the individual retailers who best recover in this new environment will be those who can quickly adapt to accelerating trends, such as the shift to ecommerce,\" she added.\nPeter Cowgill, executive chairman of JD Sports, told the BBC's Today programme that the chain's online sales had \"gained a lot of momentum\" in April and May.\nHe added that he hoped to see the same \"kickback\" in stores after non-essential retailers in England were allowed to reopen on 15 June.\n\"I think that as consumer confidence continues to grow though, that the level of footfall will grow with it,\" Mr Cowgill added.\nOn Monday, stores across England selling non-essential goods opened their doors for the first time since the lockdown began. \nShoppers arrived early to centre:mk in Milton Keynes. Some were picking up goods they had been waiting months to buy, such as baby clothes and home furnishings. Others were there for the sales. These shoppers told us what they bought - and why.\nRead more here.\nAction Fraud warned on Friday that customers should take additional care when shopping online during lockdown.\nSince shops were forced to close due on 23 March, the UK's reporting centre for fraud has received reports of online shopping fraud totalling £16.6m in losses.\nHowever, separate research suggests that shoppers might be feeling anxious about their return to the High Street.\nMore than half of UK customers expect they will now go shopping less often over the next one or two years, according to a survey of more than 1,000 people by accountancy giant EY.\nSilvia Rindone, partner in consumer product and retail at EY, said that retailers \"must do all they can to help alleviate customers' concerns\".\n\"People need to know the shopping environment and communal space is safe and that the brand is taking health and safety as seriously as they are.\"",

        "title": "'I'm having to survive on a third of what I had'",
        "description": "Kenya Williams doesn't know what to do. For 22 years, she's worked as a nanny in New York. But when coronavirus swept through the city in March, her employers asked her to stay home.\nAt the start, they covered the majority of her salary. In June, they cut her wages to just $200 (£159) a week - less than a third of her usual rate.\nMs Williams is paid off the books, so she can't file for unemployment without risking an audit of her employers. She's not sure where to turn.\n\"It's really hard,\" she says. \"Do I leave them and find new work? Do I find something temporary?\"\n\"I'm still smiling because that's all I can do.\" \nAs lockdowns lift across the US, people are starting to go back to work. But millions more remain at home, unsure when - or if - they will return.\nFor America's 2.2 million domestic workers, the majority of them women of colour, the crisis is particularly acute.\nMore than 70% saw their incomes cut or jobs eliminated at the start of the pandemic, according to a survey by the National Domestic Workers Alliance, an organisation that advocates for nannies, housecleaners and home health aides.\nWith wages that average about $12 (£9.50) an hour, few have robust financial cushions. And because of informal work arrangements or immigration status, many are not eligible for the relief offered by the government.\n\"We're talking about hundreds of thousands of women who have absolutely no access to protection or support,\" says Tatiana Bejar, a New York City-based organiser at Hand-in-Hand, a non-profit that advocates for domestic workers.\nMs Williams prefers to receive her wages under the table because it allows her to qualify for public health insurance rather than face the prohibitively expensive private market. She still pays taxes on income at the end of the year.\nThe pandemic hasn't changed changed her mind, she says, but it has reminded her of the risks.\n\"Our profession, I found out during this time, we just don't matter. We have to fight so hard for things that other people get easily,\" she says. \"I would just like to be able to be like, 'Ok, I know I'll be ok to some extent.\"\nThe hardship faced by Ms Williams matches global patterns, which show women, minorities and people working in the informal economy have been hit particularly hard by the lockdowns. In the US, the unemployment rates among Hispanic and black women approached 20% last month - nearly double that of white men.\nThe uneven economic impact is likely to add \"significantly to existing vulnerabilities and inequalities\", the International Labor Organization warned this spring. It called on governments to respond by increasing efforts to extend social protections to those people, like maids and nannies, whose work often occurs beyond the reach of government rules.\nBut the response so far doesn't bode well for those efforts. In the US, many shutdown orders didn't think to address in-home help at all. Official guidance on how to handle return has also been sparse.\nHand-in-Hand, which aims its actions at employers, has urged families to keep nannies at home at full pay, but the official ambiguity means figuring out what to do has often been a fraught family-by-family decision.\n\"Just because domestic work continues to be invisible, therefore employers of them were also invisible,\" Ms Bejar says.\nSandra, an undocumented immigrant who has worked as a nanny in New York for 20 years, asked to continue working, after her partner, a construction worker, lost his job.  Her family in Guatemala - her 87-year-old father, daughter and granddaughter - depend on her too.\nAt first, she commuted by subway, but she grew so worried about infection she started to get physically ill. Eventually, she raised the issue with her employer, who agreed to pick her up and cover the cost of a taxi for the return trip.\n\"Even if I wanted to stay home, I couldn't do it,\" she says. \"I have to keep going.\"\nSuch trade-offs speak to the need for bigger changes, says Haeyoung Yoon, policy director at the National Domestic Workers Alliance. \nThe group has proposed a national bill, which would grant domestic workers labour protections, such as a right to paid sick days. But the bill faces long odds.\nCurrently, the US has no national law requiring paid sick leave - even for workers in the formal sector. While Congress introduced some emergency leave due to the pandemic, those requirements were temporary.\n\"The coronavirus pandemic has really put a spotlight on the structural inequities that workers were already living through,\" Ms Yoon says. \"We need to really address these issues at a structural level so that workers are able to have access to good wages and good working conditions.\"\n\"But just because working people are reminded, doesn't mean that our policymakers are going to legislate and change policies to meet the needs,\" she adds.\nMs Williams says she hopes pressure for change is growing. \nTwo years ago, she joined the Carroll Garden Nanny Association, an activist group, drawn primarily by the offer of CPR training. \nBut her interest in wider employment matters has blossomed and she says an uptick in participation in the group's chats and Zoom calls since the start of the pandemic suggests she's not alone.\nMs Williams knows much of the new interest reflects the current crisis, and people at home with time on their hands.\n\"I only hope that when things get back to some type of normalcy that they stay focused,\" she says.",

        "title": "UK set to relax quarantine rule for some countries",
        "description": "The government is planning to relax its travel quarantine rules in early July for some countries.\nUK officials are talking to their counterparts in Portugal, France, Italy, Greece and Spain. \nHowever, the UK hopes to make an announcement on 29 June that it has secured a number of \"travel corridors\". \nThe government had previously said that the quarantine would be reviewed every three weeks and 29 June marks the end of the first three-week period. \nA travel corridor would mean that two people travelling in both directions between two countries would not have to self-isolate after they travel.\nThe first travel corridors could come into force on 4 July, although that date is by no means confirmed. \nEven if certain routes are exempt, the  travel quarantine for people arriving from other destinations will remain in place. \nA senior aviation source has told the BBC that the quarantine could remain throughout the summer for anyone arriving from countries which do not have a travel corridor with the UK.  \nPortugal's foreign minister previously said that anyone in the UK thinking of going to Portugal this summer would be \"most welcome\" despite the coronavirus pandemic. \nAugusto Santos Silva said he hoped an \"air bridge\" between the UK and Portugal could be secured by the end of June.\nHowever, the broader travel quarantine is expected to remain in place. \nFor more on the rules click here.\nAnyone arriving from the Republic of Ireland, the Channel Islands or the Isle of Man does not have to complete a form or enter quarantine upon arrival in the UK.\nThere are also exemptions for workers in some industries such as road haulage and medical professionals who are providing essential care.\nThe travel industry has been vocal in its criticism of the government's quarantine rules, warning that the isolation period will deter visitors and put jobs at risk. Some airlines were in the early stages of legal action.\nThe manufacturing industry has also highlighted that fewer flights will restrict imports and exports, which will have a knock-on effect for the freight industry, as well as hampering the recovery of some businesses.\nDespite criticism from businesses, Home Secretary Priti Patel said that the measures were \"proportionate\" and being implemented \"at the right time\" when they came into effect on 8 June.",

        "title": "UK debt now larger than size of whole economy",
        "description": "The UK's debt is now worth more than its economy after the government borrowed a record amount in May. \nThe £55.2bn figure was nine times higher than in May last year and the highest since records began in 1993.\nThe borrowing splurge sent total government debt surging to £1.95trn, exceeding the size of the economy for the first time in more than 50 years.\nChancellor Rishi Sunak said the figures confirmed the severe impact the virus was having on public finances.\n\"The best way to restore our public finances to a more sustainable footing is to safely reopen our economy so people can return to work. \n\"We've set out our plan to do this in a gradual and safe fashion, including reopening high streets across the country this week, as we kickstart our economic recovery,\" he added.\nIncome from tax, National Insurance and VAT all dived in May amid the coronavirus lockdown as spending on support measures soared.\nThis is the first time debt has been larger than the size of the economy since 1963, but it is not as high as the post-war peak of 258% in 1946-47.\nThe deficit - the difference between spending and tax income - for the first two months of the financial year (April and May) is now estimated to have been £103.7bn, £87bn more than in the same period last year, another record. \nBut the ONS estimates borrowing for the 2020-21 financial year will dwarf that at £298bn. That would be the largest deficit since World War Two. \nIt cautioned that due to the coronavirus, its official estimates were subject to greater than usual uncertainty.\nThe Office for National Statistics had previously said that April's borrowing figure was the highest since records began in 1993, but it subsequently revised the figure down to £48.5bn from £62bn.\nThe revision was due to higher than expected income from taxes and national insurance, as well as the spending on the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme being lower than originally estimated.\nAlex Tuckett, senior economist at consultants PwC, pointed to the 46% fall in the amount of VAT collected in the month, although it said the biggest issue for the government's finances was the £29bn it spent on the various support schemes for the economy.\n\"In the near term, there are signs the economy is recovering as the country re-opens, and this should boost tax receipts. \n\"However, these figures remind us that Chancellor Rishi Sunak faces a difficult backdrop to any summer fiscal event.\"\nSamuel Tombs at Pantheon Economics said the emergency support measures had placed a \"colossal burden\" on the public finances. \nIn a release packed with striking figures, he singled out the fact the government had needed to raise more cash in the first two months of this fiscal year than in total in any prior 10 fiscal years. \nBusting the overdraft, with a borrowing figure nine times as high as a year ago is not an easy thing for any government to swallow. In his first full year as Chancellor, Rishi Sunak is on track for the biggest public sector deficit since World War Two, \nBut it is, he reckons, a price worth paying to prevent a bigger cost to the economy, in terms of lost jobs and output. Billions have been pumped into supporting millions of jobs, and many businesses, while, on the other side, tax receipts have plunged. Those lifelines will be wound down in the coming months, and the government can borrow cheaply on financial markets to fund them.  \nBut what happens next? As lockdown is eased, the Treasury is watching closely, knowing the recovery may need extra support - perhaps tax cuts or more spending. That will present the government with more bills - but failing to provide more help risks an even higher cost. \nThe chancellor is to present some sort of statement before Parliament ceases for the summer in July - that won't be a full Budget but may contain some measures to boost the recovery.  The tough choices aren't over yet. ",

        "title": "UK plans to keep post-Brexit trade with EU flowing",
        "description": "The way British businesses trade with the European Union is set to change fundamentally at the end of the year. \nThe UK left the EU on 31 January but remains in the single market and customs union until 31 December, while the two sides try to hammer out a trade agreement.\nThe end of the so-called transition period in December will mean EU rules will no longer directly apply in Great Britain and the goods trade between them will be governed by new rules. \nBut these will only be introduced gradually.\nLast week, the government announced that relaxed controls will apply for goods coming into the UK from the EU for a period of six months. \nThese will apply whether the UK and the EU conclude a free trade agreement before the end of the year or not. \nUnlike last year, when the difference between a deal and \"no deal\" was the difference between continuing the same arrangements and a sudden reset of the two sides' trading relationship, the gap between the two outcomes is smaller.\nBut many of the challenges are the same.\nSo what are the new rules that will apply at the end of the transition and why are they being implemented?\nThe temporary regime announced by the government applies to goods arriving into the UK via ports like Dover.\nAnd they apply only to trade directly between the EU and Great Britain, not Northern Ireland.\nTrade across the land border between Republic and Northern Ireland, and Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK is covered by the special arrangements under the withdrawal agreement.\nThe Northern Ireland protocol, as it is known, applies until the UK and the EU agree to replace it or the devolved assembly at Stormont votes to end it.\nUnless special procedures apply, traders normally have to submit customs documentation that lists information about their goods they are importing and pay any tariffs or duties that are due up front at the border. \nBut under the government's plan, the requirement to do this would be put on hold for up to six months after import. \nBusinesses would keep a record of what goods they had imported in their books and pay the tariffs due subsequently. \nThe government says this is designed to help businesses, with special consideration given to the impact of coronavirus on their ability to prepare. \nBut Dr Anna Jerzewska, an associate fellow at the UK Trade Policy Observatory and an international customs consultant, told the BBC \"the main benefit is to help manage borders\".\nAt \"roll-on roll-off\" ports like Dover, which in normal times manages the movement of approximately 2.5 million lorries moving in both directions, \"speed is crucial,\" she added. \n\"Any delay in terms of the traffic moving on and off the ferry will cause traffic delays. \n\"One thing this announcement does is help to manage that so that everything can be done quickly at the border.\"\nA deal could help ease the demands made on traders and would likely mean that trade between the UK and EU would be completely tariff-free. \nBut goods would still have to prove that they qualify for the tariff exemption and most checks would still apply. \nExtra controls typically apply to plants or animals and the things we make out of them because they pose a larger risk to health.\nThe UK plans to implement these checks for goods coming into the UK from the EU but, much like customs, only after a delay of six months. \nImmediately after the end of transition period, the UK will not be checking most plant and animal products that enter through ports. \nOnly high risk products will be required to submit a notification that they are going to be imported at the start and from April this will apply to all products of animal origin - like meats and honey - as well as plants. \nFor products coming from the EU, this will be the first time that these checks have applied. That comes with its challenges. \nIn a similar way to \"no deal\" Brexit preparations at the end of last year, the concern centres on potential delays created by new checks and disruptions in supply. \n\"For a lot of sensitive products, like poultry, fish and pet food, border control agents will open up the lorry, open up products and undertake inspections and that takes time to come back from the laboratory,\" said Domonic Goudie, the head of international trade at the Food and Drink Federation, an industry body.  \n\"That threatens 'just in time' supply chains but also it starts the clock ticking on product shelf life.\"\nDifficulties are also related to where these checks take place. \nIn the EU, plants and products of animal origin have to enter via border control post where the checks take place and the UK plans to have a similar system.\nMany of the UK's ports lack the correct facilities - or the space - to carry out these checks. \nThe government has committed to building the necessary infrastructure but this will take time. \nSites need to be identified, planning permission granted and facilities built to the right specification.\nAnd where there isn't space for these facilities, such as at Dover, where the town and the port are hemmed in by cliffs, the posts will need to be built inland. \nThe checks necessary to move goods from the UK to the EU are down to European law and the EU's customs code.\nTraders hoping to export their goods to the European Union will have to fill out and submit customs documentation and complete further checks for sensitive goods. \nIn France, customs authorities have devised a pre-notification system for trucks coming from the UK.\nOnly lorries that have the right customs paperwork are allowed to board the ferry in Dover or other ports along the south coast of England. \nWhile on board, goods are matched to the lorries they are on and a colour-coded system tells drivers whether they require further checks: Green for \"no\", orange for \"yes\".\nSome ports are concerned that increases in the time that it takes to check lorries could lead to tailbacks and traffic jams. \nThe possibility that companies not used to completing customs paperwork might turn up at the port without the proper documentation is a further cause for concern.\nIn Portsmouth, port authorities are working to revive plans to triage trucks arriving at the port that were developed for a \"no deal\" Brexit.\nPortsmouth's port director Mike Sellers. said the lack of space - there are just 13 lorry-lengths between the port entry and the motorway slipway - means \"there will still be a need for pre gate checks\".\n\"Triage reduces the risk of a lack of trader awareness and freight turning up at our gate without the right documentation and causing delays.\" \nThe size of the logistical challenge depends to an extent on the volume of traffic, he added. \n\"Predominantly the crossings are booked. As one ferry leaves we don't have one arriving. Were in a good position in terms of resilience.\n\"We don't have the same challenges as Dover or the channel tunnel. They're on a turn-up-and-go basis.\"\nAlongside details of the checks that will apply after the end of the transition period, the government announced that it was pumping a further £50m into preparing the customs intermediaries sector.\nIntermediaries and freight forwarders are the professionals who help guide consignments through customs. \nIt has been estimated that the UK will need another 50,000 customs agents to deal with the potential increase in declarations for imports and exports.\nBut the UK government has said it is not able to estimate how many new customs agents have been hired and it is unclear how close the UK is to matching that target. \nA lack of agents would \"slow everything down\" says Robert Keen, director general of the British International Freight Association, an industry body which represents customs intermediaries. \n\"If the freight volumes were the same this year as they were last year we would certainly need a lot more intermediaries.\n\"But given the coronavirus crisis it is unclear what volume of trade will be moving.\" ",

        "description": "Colgate-Palmolive is reviewing Chinese toothpaste brand Darlie as firms reassess race stereotypes in products.\nThe name of the popular Chinese brand translates as \"black person toothpaste\".\nIt is owned by Colgate and its joint venture partner Hawley & Hazel and sold widely across Asia.\nA string of high-profile brands are also reviewing names and logos in light of the racism demonstrations and debate in the US.\nThe toothpaste brand was originally called Darkie before it was changed to Darlie in 1989, following pressure from shareholders and other groups.\n\"For more than 35 years, we have been working together to evolve the brand, including substantial changes to the name, logo and packaging.  We are currently working with our partner to review and further evolve all aspects of the brand, including the brand name,\" a Colgate spokesman told the BBC. \nColgate paid $50m (£40m) in 1985 for 50% of Hong Kong-based Hawley & Hazel, the maker of Darlie. The brand controls 17% of the toothpaste market in China, 21% in Singapore, 28% in Malaysia and 25% in Taiwan, according to data firm Euromonitor International.\nOn Wednesday, PepsiCo said it was changing its Aunt Jemima branding, while other food brands featuring African-American characters are reviewing their logos. Mars said it was considering possible changes to the branding of its Uncle Ben's rice, which entered the market in the 1940s.\nRacial injustice is under the spotlight following the death of African-American George Floyd while being detained by police. This sparked demonstrations around the world and gave further impetus to the Black Lives Matter movement. Corporate America has been forced to tackle the issue.\nMany British firms have also been under pressure, including brewer Greene King, Lloyd's of London and banks RBS and Lloyds Banking Group admitting former links to slave trading.",

        "title": "DIY spending splurge helps May sales recover",
        "description": "UK retail sales partly recovered in May, driven by DIY stores and garden centres reopening amid the lockdown.\nThe amount of goods sold last month increased by 12%, in comparison with record falls seen in April, according to the Office for National Statistics.\nSales were boosted by a 42% rise at household goods stores, such as hardware, furniture and paint shops.\nDespite the rebound seen in May, retail sales still remain well below pre-lockdown levels.\nNon-essential retailers in England and Northern Ireland have, however, since been allowed to reopen.\nMost shops in Scotland are to reopen from 29 June. Non-essential retailers in Wales will be told they can reopen from Monday, the first minister is expected to announce on Friday.\nNon-food stores saw the biggest increase in sales last month, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said, with DIY sales providing a bright spot.\n\"According to retailers in this sector, consumers appeared to be carrying out home improvements while spending more time than usual in their homes,\" the ONS said.\nHowever, despite the May boost, sales overall were still down by 13.1% compared with February, before the coronavirus lockdown measures were introduced. \nIn the three months to May, sales fell by 12.8% compared with the previous three months, the fastest quarterly decline since records began in 1996.\nSamuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, cautioned that the \"overall consumer picture remains bleak\".\n\"May's recovery in retail sales should not be interpreted as a sign that the economy is embarking on a healthy V-shaped recovery from Covid-19,\" he said.\n\"Naturally, spending on goods will recover faster than on services, which usually require human contact and remain largely unavailable.\"\nMay's retail sales were always going to be better than the off-the-charts collapse in April, when the full force of the lockdown was underway.\nThe decline is now reversing. But it's far from clear when retail sales will return to pre-Covid-19 levels. \nWhen non-essential shops re-opened in England on Monday, with lots of queues for some of the most popular stores, footfall was still far lower than normal. And with social distancing in place, retailers will have to limit customer numbers where necessary. \nFewer customers will mean fewer sales. With unemployment set to rise and the various government support schemes starting to ebb away, many people's finances will start to come under real pressure. \nOnline sales rose to their highest proportion on record in May while consumers stayed at home. They accounted for 33.4% of total spending, compared with 30.8% in April, the ONS added. \nLynda Petherick, head of retail for Accenture UK and Ireland, said: \"Given the wholesale shifts in consumer behaviour these last few months, it would be optimistic to assume shopping habits will return to normal in the immediate future. \n\"As the proportion of shoppers buying online continues to soar, the individual retailers who best recover in this new environment will be those who can quickly adapt to accelerating trends, such as the shift to ecommerce,\" she added.\nPeter Cowgill, executive chairman of JD Sports, told the BBC's Today programme that the chain's online sales had \"gained a lot of momentum\" in April and May.\nHe added that he hoped to see the same \"kickback\" in stores after non-essential retailers in England were allowed to reopen on 15 June.\n\"I think that as consumer confidence continues to grow though, that the level of footfall will grow with it,\" Mr Cowgill added.\nOn Monday, stores across England selling non-essential goods opened their doors for the first time since the lockdown began. \nShoppers arrived early to centre:mk in Milton Keynes. Some were picking up goods they had been waiting months to buy, such as baby clothes and home furnishings. Others were there for the sales. These shoppers told us what they bought - and why.\nRead more here.\nAction Fraud warned on Friday that customers should take additional care when shopping online during lockdown.\nSince shops were forced to close due on 23 March, the UK's reporting centre for fraud has received reports of online shopping fraud totalling £16.6m in losses.\nHowever, separate research suggests that shoppers might be feeling anxious about their return to the High Street.\nMore than half of UK customers expect they will now go shopping less often over the next one or two years, according to a survey of more than 1,000 people by accountancy giant EY.\nSilvia Rindone, partner in consumer product and retail at EY, said that retailers \"must do all they can to help alleviate customers' concerns\".\n\"People need to know the shopping environment and communal space is safe and that the brand is taking health and safety as seriously as they are.\"",

        "title": "UK set to relax quarantine rule for some countries",
        "description": "The government is planning to relax its travel quarantine rules in early July for some countries.\nUK officials are talking to their counterparts in Portugal, France, Italy, Greece and Spain. \nHowever, the UK hopes to make an announcement on 29 June that it has secured a number of \"travel corridors\". \nThe government had previously said that the quarantine would be reviewed every three weeks and 29 June marks the end of the first three-week period. \nA travel corridor would mean that two people travelling in both directions between two countries would not have to self-isolate after they travel.\nThe first travel corridors could come into force on 4 July, although that date is by no means confirmed. \nEven if certain routes are exempt, the  travel quarantine for people arriving from other destinations will remain in place. \nA senior aviation source has told the BBC that the quarantine could remain throughout the summer for anyone arriving from countries which do not have a travel corridor with the UK.  \nPortugal's foreign minister previously said that anyone in the UK thinking of going to Portugal this summer would be \"most welcome\" despite the coronavirus pandemic. \nAugusto Santos Silva said he hoped an \"air bridge\" between the UK and Portugal could be secured by the end of June.\nHowever, the broader travel quarantine is expected to remain in place. \nFor more on the rules click here.\nAnyone arriving from the Republic of Ireland, the Channel Islands or the Isle of Man does not have to complete a form or enter quarantine upon arrival in the UK.\nThere are also exemptions for workers in some industries such as road haulage and medical professionals who are providing essential care.\nThe travel industry has been vocal in its criticism of the government's quarantine rules, warning that the isolation period will deter visitors and put jobs at risk. Some airlines were in the early stages of legal action.\nThe manufacturing industry has also highlighted that fewer flights will restrict imports and exports, which will have a knock-on effect for the freight industry, as well as hampering the recovery of some businesses.\nDespite criticism from businesses, Home Secretary Priti Patel said that the measures were \"proportionate\" and being implemented \"at the right time\" when they came into effect on 8 June.",

        "title": "UK debt now larger than size of whole economy",
        "description": "The UK's debt is now worth more than its economy after the government borrowed a record amount in May. \nThe £55.2bn figure was nine times higher than in May last year and the highest since records began in 1993.\nThe borrowing splurge sent total government debt surging to £1.95trn, exceeding the size of the economy for the first time in more than 50 years.\nChancellor Rishi Sunak said the figures confirmed the severe impact the virus was having on public finances.\n\"The best way to restore our public finances to a more sustainable footing is to safely reopen our economy so people can return to work. \n\"We've set out our plan to do this in a gradual and safe fashion, including reopening high streets across the country this week, as we kickstart our economic recovery,\" he added.\nIncome from tax, National Insurance and VAT all dived in May amid the coronavirus lockdown as spending on support measures soared.\nThis is the first time debt has been larger than the size of the economy since 1963, but it is not as high as the post-war peak of 258% in 1946-47.\nThe deficit - the difference between spending and tax income - for the first two months of the financial year (April and May) is now estimated to have been £103.7bn, £87bn more than in the same period last year, another record. \nBut the ONS estimates borrowing for the 2020-21 financial year will dwarf that at £298bn. That would be the largest deficit since World War Two. \nIt cautioned that due to the coronavirus, its official estimates were subject to greater than usual uncertainty.\nThe Office for National Statistics had previously said that April's borrowing figure was the highest since records began in 1993, but it subsequently revised the figure down to £48.5bn from £62bn.\nThe revision was due to higher than expected income from taxes and national insurance, as well as the spending on the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme being lower than originally estimated.\nAlex Tuckett, senior economist at consultants PwC, pointed to the 46% fall in the amount of VAT collected in the month, although it said the biggest issue for the government's finances was the £29bn it spent on the various support schemes for the economy.\n\"In the near term, there are signs the economy is recovering as the country re-opens, and this should boost tax receipts. \n\"However, these figures remind us that Chancellor Rishi Sunak faces a difficult backdrop to any summer fiscal event.\"\nSamuel Tombs at Pantheon Economics said the emergency support measures had placed a \"colossal burden\" on the public finances. \nIn a release packed with striking figures, he singled out the fact the government had needed to raise more cash in the first two months of this fiscal year than in total in any prior 10 fiscal years. \nBusting the overdraft, with a borrowing figure nine times as high as a year ago is not an easy thing for any government to swallow. In his first full year as Chancellor, Rishi Sunak is on track for the biggest public sector deficit since World War Two, \nBut it is, he reckons, a price worth paying to prevent a bigger cost to the economy, in terms of lost jobs and output. Billions have been pumped into supporting millions of jobs, and many businesses, while, on the other side, tax receipts have plunged. Those lifelines will be wound down in the coming months, and the government can borrow cheaply on financial markets to fund them.  \nBut what happens next? As lockdown is eased, the Treasury is watching closely, knowing the recovery may need extra support - perhaps tax cuts or more spending. That will present the government with more bills - but failing to provide more help risks an even higher cost. \nThe chancellor is to present some sort of statement before Parliament ceases for the summer in July - that won't be a full Budget but may contain some measures to boost the recovery.  The tough choices aren't over yet. ",

They're on a turn-up-and-go basis.\"\nAlongside details of the checks that will apply after the end of the transition period, the government announced that it was pumping a further £50m into preparing the customs intermediaries sector.\nIntermediaries and freight forwarders are the professionals who help guide consignments through customs. \nIt has been estimated that the UK will need another 50,000 customs agents to deal with the potential increase in declarations for imports and exports.\nBut the UK government has said it is not able to estimate how many new customs agents have been hired and it is unclear how close the UK is to matching that target. \nA lack of agents would \"slow everything down\" says Robert Keen, director general of the British International Freight Association, an industry body which represents customs intermediaries. \n\"If the freight volumes were the same this year as they were last year we would certainly need a lot more intermediaries.\n\"But given the coronavirus crisis it is unclear what volume of trade will be moving.\" ",

        "description": "Colgate-Palmolive is reviewing Chinese toothpaste brand Darlie as firms reassess race stereotypes in products.\nThe name of the popular Chinese brand translates as \"black person toothpaste\".\nIt is owned by Colgate and its joint venture partner Hawley & Hazel and sold widely across Asia.\nA string of high-profile brands are also reviewing names and logos in light of the racism demonstrations and debate in the US.\nThe toothpaste brand was originally called Darkie before it was changed to Darlie in 1989, following pressure from shareholders and other groups.\n\"For more than 35 years, we have been working together to evolve the brand, including substantial changes to the name, logo and packaging.  We are currently working with our partner to review and further evolve all aspects of the brand, including the brand name,\" a Colgate spokesman told the BBC. \nColgate paid $50m (£40m) in 1985 for 50% of Hong Kong-based Hawley & Hazel, the maker of Darlie. The brand controls 17% of the toothpaste market in China, 21% in Singapore, 28% in Malaysia and 25% in Taiwan, according to data firm Euromonitor International.\nOn Wednesday, PepsiCo said it was changing its Aunt Jemima branding, while other food brands featuring African-American characters are reviewing their logos. Mars said it was considering possible changes to the branding of its Uncle Ben's rice, which entered the market in the 1940s.\nRacial injustice is under the spotlight following the death of African-American George Floyd while being detained by police. This sparked demonstrations around the world and gave further impetus to the Black Lives Matter movement. Corporate America has been forced to tackle the issue.\nMany British firms have also been under pressure, including brewer Greene King, Lloyd's of London and banks RBS and Lloyds Banking Group admitting former links to slave trading.",

        "title": "DIY spending splurge helps May sales recover",
        "description": "UK retail sales partly recovered in May, driven by DIY stores and garden centres reopening amid the lockdown.\nThe amount of goods sold last month increased by 12%, in comparison with record falls seen in April, according to the Office for National Statistics.\nSales were boosted by a 42% rise at household goods stores, such as hardware, furniture and paint shops.\nDespite the rebound seen in May, retail sales still remain well below pre-lockdown levels.\nNon-essential retailers in England and Northern Ireland have, however, since been allowed to reopen.\nMost shops in Scotland are to reopen from 29 June. Non-essential retailers in Wales will be told they can reopen from Monday, the first minister is expected to announce on Friday.\nNon-food stores saw the biggest increase in sales last month, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said, with DIY sales providing a bright spot.\n\"According to retailers in this sector, consumers appeared to be carrying out home improvements while spending more time than usual in their homes,\" the ONS said.\nHowever, despite the May boost, sales overall were still down by 13.1% compared with February, before the coronavirus lockdown measures were introduced. \nIn the three months to May, sales fell by 12.8% compared with the previous three months, the fastest quarterly decline since records began in 1996.\nSamuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, cautioned that the \"overall consumer picture remains bleak\".\n\"May's recovery in retail sales should not be interpreted as a sign that the economy is embarking on a healthy V-shaped recovery from Covid-19,\" he said.\n\"Naturally, spending on goods will recover faster than on services, which usually require human contact and remain largely unavailable.\"\nMay's retail sales were always going to be better than the off-the-charts collapse in April, when the full force of the lockdown was underway.\nThe decline is now reversing. But it's far from clear when retail sales will return to pre-Covid-19 levels. \nWhen non-essential shops re-opened in England on Monday, with lots of queues for some of the most popular stores, footfall was still far lower than normal. And with social distancing in place, retailers will have to limit customer numbers where necessary. \nFewer customers will mean fewer sales. With unemployment set to rise and the various government support schemes starting to ebb away, many people's finances will start to come under real pressure. \nOnline sales rose to their highest proportion on record in May while consumers stayed at home. They accounted for 33.4% of total spending, compared with 30.8% in April, the ONS added. \nLynda Petherick, head of retail for Accenture UK and Ireland, said: \"Given the wholesale shifts in consumer behaviour these last few months, it would be optimistic to assume shopping habits will return to normal in the immediate future. \n\"As the proportion of shoppers buying online continues to soar, the individual retailers who best recover in this new environment will be those who can quickly adapt to accelerating trends, such as the shift to ecommerce,\" she added.\nPeter Cowgill, executive chairman of JD Sports, told the BBC's Today programme that the chain's online sales had \"gained a lot of momentum\" in April and May.\nHe added that he hoped to see the same \"kickback\" in stores after non-essential retailers in England were allowed to reopen on 15 June.\n\"I think that as consumer confidence continues to grow though, that the level of footfall will grow with it,\" Mr Cowgill added.\nOn Monday, stores across England selling non-essential goods opened their doors for the first time since the lockdown began. \nShoppers arrived early to centre:mk in Milton Keynes. Some were picking up goods they had been waiting months to buy, such as baby clothes and home furnishings. Others were there for the sales. These shoppers told us what they bought - and why.\nRead more here.\nAction Fraud warned on Friday that customers should take additional care when shopping online during lockdown.\nSince shops were forced to close due on 23 March, the UK's reporting centre for fraud has received reports of online shopping fraud totalling £16.6m in losses.\nHowever, separate research suggests that shoppers might be feeling anxious about their return to the High Street.\nMore than half of UK customers expect they will now go shopping less often over the next one or two years, according to a survey of more than 1,000 people by accountancy giant EY.\nSilvia Rindone, partner in consumer product and retail at EY, said that retailers \"must do all they can to help alleviate customers' concerns\".\n\"People need to know the shopping environment and communal space is safe and that the brand is taking health and safety as seriously as they are.\"",

It is fair and legitimate to expect that they pay their fair share of tax within countries where they create value and profit.\"\nThe finance ministers' letter says a solution is still possible this year. \nWithout it, and with promises from the European finance ministers to push ahead with their taxes, a tit-for-tat trade war could be in the offing, in the middle of a severe global recession, caused by the pandemic.",

        "title": "Bank pumps £100bn into UK economy to aid recovery",
        "description": "The Bank of England will pump an extra £100bn into the UK economy to help fight the \"unprecedented\" coronavirus-induced downturn.\nBank policymakers voted 8-1 to increase the size of its bond-buying programme.\nHowever, they said there was growing evidence that the hit to the economy would be \"less severe\" than initially feared.\nThe Bank's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) also kept interest rates at a record low of 0.1%.\nThe move comes just days after Bank governor Andrew Bailey said policymakers were ready to take action after the economy suffered its biggest monthly contraction on record.\nThe UK economy shrank by 20.4% in April, while official jobs data showed the number of workers on UK payrolls fell by more than 600,000 between March and May.\nThe Bank said more recent indicators suggested the economy was starting to bounce back.\nMinutes from the MPC's June meeting said: \"Payments data are consistent with a recovery in consumer spending in May and June, and housing activity has started to pick up recently.\"\nHowever, Mr Bailey warned that the outlook for the economy remained uncertain. He said: \"We don't want to get too carried away by this. Let's be clear, we're still living in very unusual times.\"\nThe minutes added: \"While recent demand and output data had not been quite as negative as expected, other indicators suggested greater risks around the potential for longer-lasting damage to the economy from the pandemic.\"\nBack in May, policymakers warned the economy was heading for its sharpest recession on record.\nScenarios drawn up by the Bank suggested the economy could shrink by 25% in the three months to June.\nHowever, the MPC said more recent evidence suggested the contraction would be less severe.\nThe extra monetary stimulus - known as quantitative easing (QE) - will raise the total size of the Bank's asset purchase programme to £745bn.\nPolicymakers said the injection would help to support financial markets and underpin the recovery.\nHowever, Andy Haldane, the Bank's chief economist, voted against the increase.\nHe said the recovery was happening \"sooner and materially faster\" than the Bank expected in May.\nPolicymakers said the jobs market was likely to remain weak for some time, with a risk of \"higher and more persistent unemployment\".\nMillions of workers have already seen their pay packets shrink as a result of lower pay for furloughed employees. A survey by the Bank said other companies had postponed or cancelled pay rises this year. \nMr Bailey said: \"Even with the relaxation of some Covid-related restrictions on economic activity, a degree of precautionary behaviour by households and businesses is likely to persist. The economy, and especially the labour market, will therefore take some time to recover towards its previous path.\"\nMr Bailey also addressed the recent fall in UK inflation in an open letter to Chancellor Rishi Sunak.\nInflation, as measured by the consumer prices index (CPI), fell to 0.5% in May, from 0.8% in April - well below the Bank of England's 2% target.\nMr Bailey said weak inflation had been by driven by falling oil and energy prices, as well as a global drop in economic activity.\nThe Bank expects inflation to return to target within two years.\nSamuel Tombs of Pantheon Macroeconomics expects the Bank to increase QE again later this year.\n\"Unemployment looks set to rise sharply in the second half of this year and to fall back slowly thereafter,\" he said.\n\"The resulting prolonged weakness in domestically generated inflation likely will necessitate the MPC doing more to stimulate the economy in the winter.\"\nThe Bank of England has increased its support for the economy, despite it assessing that the outlook is not quite as awful as its scenario last month. The economy is on course for a hit in the second quarter of about 20% compared with the final three months of 2019. That's still historic, and off the scale, but not quite as extreme as the 27% it predicted in May. \nThe extra £100bn of purchases of government bonds also has the air of an insurance policy.\nMost of the MPC were concerned about a couple of factors, A less awful outlook does not mean the recovery will be quick. This is for two reasons stretching beyond economics. \nThere is a fear that the \"prevalence of the virus\" in the UK will mean that Britons will continue to socially distance, voluntarily, holding back the recovery more than other nations (Germany would be an example). \nRelated to that was the idea that more QE now could mitigate the economic impact of \"higher rates of Covid-19 infection going forward\" - a second wave. \nSo the news is still bad, but less awful. But risks beyond the purely economic led to more billions being injected into the economy.",

        "title": "Have we become too reliant on Big Tech firms?",
        "description": "\"We wouldn't have survived without Amazon,\" says Keith Ingram, owner of vinyl records shop Assai Records.\nWhen lockdown hit on 23 March in the UK, Mr Ingram had to shut his shops in Edinburgh and Dundee, and sell his stock through Amazon Marketplace. Now, his sales are 40% higher than last year. \n\"Without Amazon, we would have had to furlough all employees for all of lockdown. Instead, we furloughed them for four weeks until we adjusted ourselves to the new normal, and then we could retrain staff to help us fulfil our online orders,\" he says.\nIt's not just Amazon that has been used more during the pandemic. Apple and Android smartphones and tablets, Facebook's apps and Microsoft tools have provided crucial links with friends, family and colleagues.\nAnd that's certainly been great for investors and the billionaires behind these firms. Shares in Facebook, Apple, Amazon and Microsoft all hit all-time highs on the stock market in June.\nBetween 18 March and 19 May, Amazon's Jeff Bezos saw his wealth swell by $34.6bn (£27.6bn) and Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg's wealth rose by $25bn (£19.9bn), according to a recent report.\nBut is this reliance on Big Tech getting out of control? \n\"Amazon have gone from being the dominant gatekeepers for online commerce to being the dominant gatekeeper for much of retail because of the lockdowns,\" says Stacy Mitchell, co-director of the Institute for Local Self-Reliance, the US organisation that challenges concentrated economic and political power.\nMeanwhile, this week the UK government announced that it would be using a coronavirus-tracing app based on technology from Apple and Google.\nGermany, Italy and Denmark are among other countries also using that system.\nBig Tech firms have been getting even bigger during the pandemic and their success means they have plenty of funds to snap up other businesses.\nFor example, in May Facebook announced its second biggest deal - a plan to buy a 10% stake in India's Jio, a telecoms and digital services business.\n\"All of them will be in the M&A [mergers and acquisitions] game if they're not already. Start-ups are more likely to sell out during the pandemic when they might struggle to meet their obligations and the buyout looks especially attractive - the pandemic is speeding up the buyout date in some cases,\" says Sandeep Vaheesan, legal director at the Open Markets Institute, a think-tank that studies corporate concentration.\nBefore the pandemic, there had been scrutiny on Big Tech. The US House Judiciary antitrust subcommittee sent requests for information to Amazon, Apple, Google owner Alphabet and Facebook in September 2019, with the government concerned that only a small number of companies hold such a big share of the digital market.\nCoronavirus may have delayed these investigations, but they will still be carried out.\n\"Those focused on antitrust will renew their attention on big tech companies because we're in an election year [in the US] and both parties are going to want the attention on their efforts to regulate business,\" says Jonathan Osborne, a lawyer from Globalaw's law firm Gunster. \nMr Vaheesan warns that in the US, the Department of Justice (DoJ) and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) have not taken company acquisitions seriously enough - clearing the acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp by Facebook, and YouTube and Android by Google.\nHe is not optimistic that the DoJ and the FTC will change their approach in the future.\nIn the UK, Amazon's multi-million pound investment in Deliveroo was provisionally cleared by competition chiefs because the takeaway courier said it would collapse if it was blocked. A final ruling is due on 6 August. \n\"That was a one-off, the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) looked at the market circumstances and saw them changing because of the pandemic, but the pandemic is not a reason for Big Tech companies to get away with scrutiny - absolutely not,\" says Jonathan Branton, head of competition at law firm DWF.\nThe CMA has since announced it is investigating Facebook's acquisition of Giphy, the popular owner of a library of short animations and stickers used in social media.\nMore Technology of Business\nBut is the current level of scrutiny enough, and will it change because of the pandemic?\n\"It's hard to look into a crystal ball. I think Microsoft has taken a strong stance on trust, security and ethical use of AI, and while we've been focusing more on the crisis response in the short term, we still maintain and apply these principles and they will apply in the future. It's then about how public, industry and government look at that across the usage of Big Tech in the market,\" says Microsoft's Azure business lead Michael Wignall.\nMr Vaheesan suggests that these major investigations into tech companies may not be what they seem.\n\"It's too soon to say whether these are serious inquiries or whether they're merely a window dressing responding to the public and political concerns about the power of the big five tech companies.\"\nIn the US the picture is further complicated by President Trump's fraught relationship with Twitter.\nIn May, for the first time, the company attached fact-check links to the President's tweets.\nThat prompted a furious response from the White House with the President threatening to \"strongly regulate\" or even \"close down\" social media firms.\nFacebook has also been under pressure to remove comments made by the President, but has so far kept his posts up.\nRepublicans feel that Social Media Platforms totally silence conservatives voices. We will strongly regulate, or close them down, before we can ever allow this to happen. We saw what they attempted to do, and failed, in 2016. We can’t let a more sophisticated version of that....\nEnd of Twitter post  by @realDonaldTrump\nTo help protect their interests, the Big Tech firms have hundreds of lobbyists working in Washington.\n\"When I meet with elected representatives in Washington DC, they're almost a bit bereft that there are more lobbyists than they have staffers to write this legislation,\" says Scott Galloway, professor of marketing at NYU Stern.\n\"The budgets at DoJ and the FTC have been cut every year, so although there's more likely to be anti-trust action with a change in the White House, the question is whether the US government even has the resources anymore,\" says Mr Galloway. \nMr Galloway believes that Europe is more likely to take the lead on tougher sanctions against Big Tech than the US. \n\"Europe gets all of the downside of big tech... but they get very little of the upside. In the US, these are tremendous economic engines, providing a lot of jobs and a source of pride - they create that ecosystem of other successful companies around them,\" he says.\nThe European Commission announced two new antitrust investigations into Apple this week, while a recent Wall Street Journal report suggested that Amazon could be next on the EU's agenda, over its treatment of third party sellers.\n\"It raises the question: why are we so dependent on a handful of large companies? Would we actually lose anything as a society if we had multiple online marketplaces? There's really nothing that compels us to accept the present structure of these markets,\" says Mr Vaheesan. \nBig tech may be getting stronger during the pandemic, but it may actually make things harder for them in the long term.\nAmazon, Facebook, Apple and Alphabet were asked for a response but declined to comment.

        "title": "Why a recession can be a good time to start a business",
        "description": "What do General Motors, Burger King, CNN, Uber and Airbnb all have in common?\nThey were all founded during economic downturns.\nGM launched in 1908, when the US economy was in turmoil after \"the Panic of 1907\" financial crisis. Meanwhile, Burger King flipped its first patty in 1953, when the US was again in recession, and CNN started its news broadcasts in 1980, when US inflation hit almost 15%.\nBoth Uber and Airbnb set up business during the global financial crisis of 2007-09.\nThese examples show that many of the best, and longest-lasting, companies are set up during downturns, according to Dane Strangler, a fellow at the Bipartisan Policy Centre, in Washington DC. He says that the difficult economic backdrop makes them both tougher and more nimble for years to come.\n\"There's this trial by fire idea,\" he says. \"If you get started in a recession, you really have to scrape and scrimp to make that company successful.\n\"You are trying to make it when you can't get financing, and trying to get customers when there isn't any demand.\"\nWe are certainly in a downturn again now, as a result of coronavirus and the subsequent lockdowns around the world.\nThe World Bank predicts that the global economy will shrink by 5.2% in 2020, its worst performance since 1946 and the aftermath of World War Two. \nThe US economy is already in recession, and the Bank of England predicts that the UK is about to see its sharpest downturn since 1706 . That's 314 years ago.\nBut as history shows, successful companies can be born in tough times. Could there be promising start-ups from the entrepreneurial class of 2020 that will go on to become household names?\nMore new businesses are certainly being set up despite - and as a result of - coronavirus. In the US, 67,160 applications were filed to set up new companies in the last week of May, official figures show.\nThat was a 21% rise on the same seven days in 2019. Whereas from 2018 to 2019, the figure for that week declined by 3.3%.\nRobert Fairlie, an economics professor at the University of California Santa Cruz, says the latest increase is party because more people start businesses when jobs are scarce. He calls this \"necessity entrepreneurship\".\n\"If someone doesn't have opportunities in a salaried job, that's part of the motivation [behind setting up their own company],\" he says.\nBut some entrepreneurs may have had ideas for businesses stewing for a while.\n\"With the shutdown people have had more time to think, and take time back from busy work schedules,\" says Prof Fairlie. \"So if there's a business idea they've had, they might think, let's try this out.\"\nMore from the BBC's series taking an international perspective on trade:\nOther new start-ups have recognised that bleak as coronavirus is, it has presented business opportunities that also allow them to do their bit to help defeat the pandemic.\nThis is especially true when it comes to PPE, or personal protective equipment, and the number of new firms set up in the past few months to fill a shortfall in supply.\nMatthew Campbell-Hill and his wife Lydia launched their business Aerosol Shield in April. The firm's eponymous product is a small, pop-up medical isolation shield or \"tent\". Transparent plastic sheeting attached to a plastic frame, it can be placed around a patient's head and shoulders, thereby reducing medical staff's exposure to the person's coughs.\n\"We didn't set out to start a business, [but] we went from knowing about the issue to launching the company in six days, and taking bulk orders before we'd finished the seventh day,\" says Mr Campbell-Hill, who is a senior fellow at the University of Birmingham's Institute of Clinical Sciences.\nTo make the shields, he and Lydia - who is a GP - worked with Airquee, a Welsh business that makes tents for armies and humanitarian organisations, and is also Europe's largest manufacturer of bouncy castles.\nAnother UK business launched as a result of coronavirus is Hidden Smile, a facemask supplier set up earlier this month by Oxfordshire-based entrepreneur Neill Cotton.\nIts masks are made from two layers of cotton, with a folded paper filter inside.\n\"You don't need to replace the filter as often, as it isn't exposed to the outside world, nor, crucially, to the moisture of the mouth,\" says Mr Cotton. \"You also look like an extra from [medical TV drama] Holby City.\"\nOther industries that have seen a big rise in business as a result of coronavirus, and therefore offer opportunities to new start-ups, include home improvement and the delivery sector.\nNicole Gibbons, who founded US paint firm Clare in 2018, says that sales have soared as a result of the lockdown. \"Normally people would rather have brunch on weekends, and not paint their homes.\" she says. \"But now they have cabin fever, and want to do something.\"\nMeanwhile, London-based courier business Gophr says it has just seen its busiest ever two months as more people have got a taste for online shopping.\nFor anyone thinking of now setting up their own business, Markus Berger de Leon, a partner at management consultancy McKinsey, says think long and hard before you make the plunge. But if you do jump, then move quickly.\n\"You really need to think, 'should I spend my next pound or euro on this, or something else?',\" he says.\n\"And that makes you need to embrace and scale one skill that is core to your company. And think about doing that with as little money, as fast as possible. The start-ups that survive a recession are the ones that learn the fastest.\"",

        "title": "What Trump wants from trade",
        "description": "President Donald Trump's approach to international trade is driven to a large extent by his belief that the United States is being unfairly treated by other countries.\nHis main supporting evidence is the trade deficit - the US buys more than it sells internationally. \nHe has referred to the deficit as losing money. In one tweet he wrote about losing $500bn (£388bn) a year as a result of crazy trade with China. No more, he promised.  \nOne of his central economic objectives has been to reduce it. In November 2017, his first year in office, he referred to the total deficit with all trade partners of almost $800bn a year as unacceptable. He said: \"We are going to start whittling that down, and as fast as possible\". \nRivals is a season of in-depth coverage on BBC News about the contest for supremacy between the US and China across trade, tech, defence and soft power.\nRead more here.\nBut it hasn't come down. The figure that President Trump referred to was for trade in goods alone. It has increased in both of the full years since he took office. \nIt was $750bn in the final year under President Barack Obama, $887bn in 2018, and the increase has continued. We have figures for the first nine months of this year, showing the deficit was larger, though only slightly, than in the same period of 2018. \nMr Trump focuses on bilateral deficits, often suggesting they are evidence of the unfair actions of the other country concerned.\nThe deficit with China is by far the largest. It rose in Mr Trump's first two years, but for the first nine months of 2019 it is lower. Both imports and exports have fallen, imports by more. \nThat is hardly surprising as the two countries have applied increased tariffs to large swathes of one another's goods. \nSo a success for President Trump?  Only if you think bilateral trade balances really matter. And most economists think they don't. \nGetting one bilateral deficit down does not guarantee you reduce the overall deficit. The deficit with China may be down, but others have increased - Vietnam, Mexico and Taiwan for example. \nMore from the BBC's series taking an international perspective on trade:\nPart of the underlying story is the fact that the trade balance with the rest of the world is mainly driven not by barriers that countries put in the way of one another's goods.\nInstead, it's about whether countries buy more goods and services than they produce. Prof Greg Mankiw of Harvard University (who used to be a supporter of the Republican Party) puts it like this: \"If you really want to reduce a trade deficit, the way to do it is to bring down spending relative to production, not to demonise trading partners around the world.\"\nPresident Trump has, if anything, done just the opposite. His tax cuts have given a boost to the US economy, though that may now be fading. But it's not really surprising that the trade deficit should rise as Americans - families and businesses - have had more to spend, and some of that money goes on imported goods. \nThere is an idea in economics known as the \"twin deficits hypothesis\", that there is a link between a government budget deficit and a trade deficit - or strictly speaking, a current account deficit that includes some financial transactions in addition to trade in goods and services. \nIt is by no means a settled debate, but the idea that tax cuts can in some circumstances lead to a larger trade deficit is entirely credible.  \nSo there is a coherent story here that President Trump has taken steps - tax cuts - that make it harder to achieve something else he wants - a reduction in the trade deficit.  \nThat's not to say that President Trump isn't on to something, in the sense that his views on trade may reflect real economic damage in some communities. The Nobel Prize winner Esther Duflo says there is among economists an \"instinctive view on trade, that it should be good for everyone\". But it's not true she says.\nAlthough trade boosts growth overall, it does produce concentrated pockets of job losses, she says. That's not a new view, and it doesn't mean you can turn the clock back or reverse the losses by putting up new trade barriers. ",

        "title": "Huawei: Boom time in China",
        "description": "Jun Yu can't resist gadgets.\nMore than 20 smartphones, old tablets and other devices lurk in a corner of his Beijing home - an ever-growing tech junkyard.\nHis apartment also boasts a Google Home smart assistant and an Amazon Echo.\n\"I take three phones out with me every day. I use a phone for Chinese apps, I use my iPhone for Gmail and western apps, and I use my Google Pixel phone for work,\" says the 34-year-old tech entrepreneur.  \nHis obsession has paid off though. In 2009, he bought the first phone to use Android, the software that now runs more than 80% of smartphones.\nA year later, the physics graduate, founded his own company creating content for Chinese Android users. By 2016 he had sold the company for an undisclosed amount to Alibaba, the Chinese e-commerce giant.\nNow he is excited about the next generation of technology, known as 5G. It promises lightning fast internet connections for your mobile phone - fast enough to download movies in a matter of seconds, or to stream high definition TV.\nIn October, Jun Yu pre-ordered a 5G-ready smartphone, made by China's Xiaomi.\n\"4G has enabled many things like mobile video, more immersive gaming. I know 5G will too. But I don't exactly know how yet,\" he says.\nBut in the US and UK the rollout of 5G networks has been hampered by an international row over one of the most important suppliers of 5G equipment, China's Huawei.\nRivals is a season of in-depth coverage on BBC News about the contest for supremacy between the US and China across trade, tech, defence and soft power.\nRead more here.\nThe US has banned the use of Huawei equipment in 5G networks over security fears, and has encouraged its allies to do the same. It also maintains a tight control over what US companies can sell to Huawei, which has disrupted sales of Huawei phones overseas.\nIndustry analysts like Edison Lee, an analyst from financial services group Jefferies, see the US pressure on Huawei as an attempt to break China's potential dominance of the global 5G market. \n\"The tech war is based on America's argument that China's technological advances have been built upon stolen intellectual property rights, and heavy government subsidies, and their belief that Chinese telecom equipment is not safe, and is a national security threat to the US and its allies,\" he says. \n\"As Huawei and [fellow Chinese firm] ZTE increasingly dominate the global telecom equipment market, the western world will be more vulnerable to Chinese spying,\" Lee adds.\nHuawei has always strongly denied that its technology can be used for spying.\nWhile western nations worry about one of the key suppliers of 5G technology, China is racing ahead with its 5G rollout.\nOn 31 October Chinese telecom companies launched 5G services in more than 50 Chinese cities, creating one of the world's largest 5G networks.\nHuawei has built an estimated 50% of the network.\nThe Chinese Ministry of Information claims that in just 20 days the country registered more than 800,000 subscribers. Analysts predict China will have as many as 110 million 5G users by 2020.\nAnd China's tech sector is busy coming up with uses for the new tech.\nOn a large plot of land in northern Hong Kong, researchers are developing 5G powered autonomous vehicles.\nResearchers at Hong Kong Applied Science and Technology Research Institution are working in partnership with China Mobile, the largest telecom company in China. \nThey see 5G as being particularly useful for self-driving cars, allowing the cars to build an accurate picture of what's going on around them, by communicating with other vehicles, traffic signals and sensors in the road.\n\"For consumers, 5G will possibly transform how we interact with other. For the government, 5G will transform roads and road infrastructure to enable new applications like enhanced assisted-driving and eventually autonomous driving,\" says Alex Mui, a researcher on the project. \nChina is not the first country to roll out 5G. But it is building one of the world's biggest 5G markets very quickly.\nWhile Huawei and ZTE are doing well from that expansion, they would still like to break into lucrative overseas markets like the US. \nSpeaking at a 5G convention in Beijing in November, China's minister for industry and information accused America of using cybersecurity as an excuse for protectionism. \n\"No country should ban a company in its 5G network rollout by using the unproved allegations of cybersecurity risks,\" said Miao Wei.\nMore Technology of Business\nIndustry analysts are not confident that the row between China and the US will be sorted out anytime soon.\n\"We see the current tensions as a technological Cold War, as tech nationalism intensifies,\" says Ben Wood, chief of research, at CCS Insight.\n\"With the Chinese government firmly committed to establishing China as a world-leading 5G nation, the opportunity for Huawei in its home market is immense.\n\"However, the rest of the world can't afford to get left behind, and without access to Huawei infrastructure US mobile network operators in particular will need to rely on alternative suppliers who may be more expensive and less advanced with 5G.\"",

        "title": "How China plans to lead in computer chips",
        "description": "On a university campus on the outskirts of Hong Kong a group of engineers are designing computer chips they hope will be used in the next generation of Chinese made smart phones.\nPatrick Yue leans back in his chair in a coffee shop on the campus, sporting a Stanford University t-shirt. He is the lead engineer and professor overseeing the project.\nHis research team designs optical communication chips, which use light rather than electrical signals to transfer information, and are needed in 5G mobile phones and other internet-connected devices.\nHe tells me about the challenges China faces in developing a world-beating computer chip industry.\n\"I actually think the actual designers will be as big a bottle neck as the manufacturing. We don't have nearly as many research institutes and industry bases to train the designers,\" he says.\nHis department is part-funded by Huawei, the Chinese communications and telecom giant at the centre of an international political storm. \nIn May the US added Huawei to a list of companies that US firms cannot trade with unless they have a licence, blaming security concerns.\nRivals is a season of in-depth coverage on BBC News about the contest for supremacy between the US and China across trade, tech, defence and soft power.\nRead more here.\nMany industry observers fear that the US-Chinese trade war, risks unravelling the global technology supply chain.\nIn particular, China relies on overseas companies for computer chips (or semiconductors), the tiny devices used in everything from consumer electronics to military hardware. \n\"Politically everything can be used as a bargaining power,\" says Mr Yue.\n\"If these companies and countries start to hold back on technology then everyone will get hurt. It's not good from a technological point of view,\" Mr Yue says.\nChina has made no secret of its desire to become self-sufficient in technology. The nation is both the world's largest importer and consumer of semiconductors.\nIt currently produces just 16% of the semiconductors fuelling its tech boom. \nBut it has plans to produce 40% of all semiconductors it uses by 2020, and 70% by 2025, an ambitious plan spurred by the trade war with the US.\nIn May 2018 China's President Xi Jinping met with the country's leading scientists and engineers, calling for specialists to work towards self-reliance in the production of core technologies.\nThat meeting was just a month after the US government banned US firms from selling components to ZTE, China's second-largest maker of telecom network equipment.\nThe ban highlighted to China's leaders that the nation's tech boom was dependent on foreign technology. \nIn October this year, in its latest bid to help wean the nation's tech sector away from US technology, the Chinese government created a $29bn (£22bn) fund to support the semiconductor industry.\n\"There is no question that China has the engineers to make chips. The question is whether they can make competitive ones,\" questions Piero Scaruffi, a Silicon Valley historian, and artificial intelligence researcher who works in Silicon Valley.\nMore Technology of Business\n\"Certainly, Huawei can develop its own chips and operating systems, and the government can make sure that they will be successful in China. But Huawei and other Chinese phone makers are successful also in foreign markets, and that's a totally different question: Will Huawei's chips and operating systems be as competitive as Qualcomm's and Android? Most likely not. At best, it will take years before they are,\" Mr Scaruffi adds.\nMr Scaruffi estimates that China could be as many as 10 years behind the leading producers of high-end computer chips. The majority of chips made for high-end electronics are manufactured by specialist foundries like the Taiwanese Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC). It produces more than 70% of chips designed by third party companies. \nJust securing the best machinery needed to make high-end chips is difficult.\n\"To start out with equipment, its very high precision equipment. You need to print very fine features.  The equipment that is needed to have this kind of technology is controlled by a few companies in the world,\" says Mr Yue. \nHe believes that Chinese technology is three to four generations behind companies like TSMC. China lacks the industry experience to manufacture high end chips, he says. But he believes that companies like Huawei are already competitive when it comes to designing chips.\nWhere does this leave the tech giant Huawei?\nMr Yue argues that Huawei is trying to replicate the successful business models of firms like Samsung, which produces its own computer chips - rather than trying to fall into line with Beijing's industrial ambitions.\n\"You can almost view them as an integrated company with the expertise of what Apple or Qualcomm has,\" says Mr Yue.\nLi Changzhu is a lifelong employee of Huawei and president of the company's handset business. He joined the company 23 years ago as a fresh graduate and has watched it grow into the international tech giant. He claims that the goal of companies like Huawei is simply to satisfy consumer needs. \n\"We are open to use other vendors chipsets. Every year we purchase a lot of chips from Qualcomm. We are open to that. We use the best chipsets to satisfy our customers,\" he says sitting on the side of a tech conference in Macau, a semi- autonomous southern Chinese city.\nGrowth in the semiconductor industry is typically driven by disruptive new technologies. In the late 2000s the introduction of smartphones boosted demand for the tiny integrated circuits that control everything from memory to Bluetooth and wifi.\nBut today China's ambition to dominate sectors such as artificial intelligence and 5G is expected to further ramp up demand for high-end chips.\nIndustry analysts like Mr Scaruffi question China's ability to truly innovate. \"Every Chinese city wants to build its own Silicon Valley. It tends to be more driven from the top. Silicon Valley had a big advantage, that it was very far away from the political power,\" says Mr Scaruffi. \nHe believes that China's technological success lies in the implementation of technology rather than its creation.\n\"If your metric is how many people use smart phones to go shopping then China wins big time. But if your metric is Nobel Prize winners, then China is losing badly. China of course has been very successful in implementing technology in a way that dramatically alters society,\" he says. ",

        "title": "Is China gaining an edge in AI?",
        "description": "\"China is betting on AI and investing in AI and deploying AI on a scale no other country is doing,\" says Abishur Prakash, a futurist and author of books about the effect of artificial intelligence (AI) on geopolitics.\nAs developments in AI accelerate, some in the US fear that the ability of China's powerful central government to marshal data and pour resources into the field will push it ahead. \nThe country has announced billions in funding for start-ups, launched programmes to woo researchers from overseas and streamlined its data policies. \nIt has announced news-reading robots and AI-powered strategy for foreign relations. Perhaps most alarming to the US are its efforts to incorporate it into its military.\nIn the last few years, Washington has toughened oversight of Chinese investments, banned US firms from doing business with certain Chinese companies and increased criminal prosecution of alleged technology theft.\n\"What the Trump administration is doing is a sign... the US knows that its geopolitical power will be redefined and reconfigured by this era,\" said Mr Prakash, who works at the Toronto-based Center for Innovating the Future.\nThese developments come amid political tension between the two nations. Yet, some analysts worry the US response is counterproductive, arguing that cutting off access to US microchips, for example, could simply accelerate Chinese efforts to develop their own alternatives.\nThe Trump administration has imposed tariffs on billions of dollars worth of Chinese goods - retaliation for \"unfair\" practices it says are aimed at giving China an advantage in the field.\nThe White House has also pressed universities to review their relationships with Chinese partners and threatened to restrict student visas. It is even said to be looking at rules against certain US investments in China - once nearly unthinkable in free-market America.\nRivals is a season of in-depth coverage on BBC News about the contest for supremacy between the US and China across trade, tech, defence and soft power.\nRead more here.\nThe actions are aimed at preserving US leadership in technologies expected to determine economic and military power for generations to come.\n\"That China will grow to be an economy as large as ours may be inevitable; that we aid their mercantilist strategy through free trade and open investment in our technology sector is a choice,\" US Department of Defense officials wrote in a widely cited 2018 report.\nAs the US and China race to capitalise on advances in machine learning, facial recognition and other forms of artificial intelligence, Tom Mitchell has a front row seat.\nThe professor of computer science founded the world's first research centre for artificial intelligence at Carnegie Mellon in the US. Since 2018, he has also served as chief scientist at Squirrel, a leading tutoring company in China. \nHe says the US has more experience building tech companies, but China may have the advantage when it comes to AI applications relying on big data sets - and points to the medical field as an example.\n\"In the US we've had electronic medical records for over 20 years but we still have not put together all the records in the country to run machine-learning algorithms on those.\" \nHe says the US has been inhibited by privacy concerns, as well as a fractured, for-profit industry. \n\"In China, it's a different situation. If the government decides that it's going to have country-wide electronic medical records... then it's going to happen.\"\nProf Mitchell, who is working on using AI to improve education, says working in both the US and China puts him in the best position to invent and apply cutting-edge technology.\nBut that kind of cross-border collaboration is facing increasing scrutiny, given rising political tensions.\nLast year, Chinese investment in the US dropped to $4.8bn (£3.7bn) - its lowest level since 2011 - while US investment in China dipped from $14bn to $13bn, according to the Rhodium Group's annual report.\nHigh-profile Chinese firms, like insurance giant Anbang and Kai-Fu Lee's Sinovation Ventures, have reportedly sold or scaled back US operations, while China's Huawei and ZTE have suffered serious losses after being subject to US bans. \nIn US academic circles, universities are rethinking their ties to China, while US firms doing business in China have also grown more cautious.\nMr Prakash, who works with start-ups, tech firms and governments on questions of artificial intelligence, says while many western firms continue to pursue opportunities in China, current tensions have changed the discussions.\n\"Geopolitics is now front and centre for all of them,\" he says. \"They're forced to say, hey, we're based in Silicon Valley, we're selling to part of Asia and now as this tech war unfolds we need to understand what's possible, what can we do, what are our options.\"\nMore Technology of Business\nProf Mitchell says policymakers need to distinguish between AI applications that are win-win and those that are truly competitive, such as those for the military.\nIn the meantime, he says Washington's increasingly nationalist tone risks alienating America's foreign students and researchers - many of them Chinese - who have played a critical role in US tech leadership to date.\n\"To start thinking about putting up export control walls around the US could be as damaging to the US research enterprise as anything that a foreign adversary might try to do to us. I hope we will act rationally and not just out of fear.\"\nWhile US concerns about technology theft have merit, \"I feel like we're over-reacting,\" says Prof Mitchell.\n\"The fact that China or the UK or anybody decides they want to be a leader in AI - it would be surprising if they did not. It's not something to be reviled,\" he says.\nAmerican national plans have also called for boosting investment, reforming the immigration system and improving education, but those are much more difficult to achieve, says William Carter, deputy director of technology policy at Washington's Center for Strategic and International Studies.\n\"Being hard on China is an easy political sell,\" he says, but warns that, \"I think we're shooting ourselves in the foot in a lot of ways\".\nThe race between the US and China is now moving to other countries, which are being pushed to take sides as tech firms from the two compete for turf. \nThe US has pressed its allies to stop using equipment from China's Huawei, for example, citing concerns that Beijing could use the firm's equipment for hacking. It has also raised human rights concerns.\nAt a recent conference, a US official argued that Chinese tech companies are \"de facto tools\" of the state's Communist Party, saying they \"have become deeply enmeshed in Beijing's system of oppression at home and its increasingly assertive strategic ambitions globally.\"\nAs artificial intelligence technologies drive debates over values like surveillance and privacy, free speech and censorship, conflicts between the two countries are likely to increase, says Nicholas Wright, a fellow at the New America think tank in Washington, who has worked with the US and UK governments.\n\"To some extent, this is just a generic challenge, where you have a new set of technologies and whomever manages to implement them first and best will gain an advantage... but then there's also another set of issues which is to do with the specifics of these new digital technologies,\" he says.\nFor now, it may take artificial intelligence to know how the race will end.

        "title": "What went wrong with the coronavirus app?",
        "description": "After months of work, the UK has ditched the way its coronavirus-tracing app works, prompting a blame game between the government and two of the world's biggest tech firms. So what went wrong?\nAt the end of March, I got a text from a senior figure in the UK's technology industry. This person said they were helping the NHS \"on a very substantial project that will launch in days and potentially save hundreds of thousands of British lives.\"\nThat was the first I knew of the plan to build a contact tracing app, a project that soon appeared to be at the very centre of the government's strategy to beat coronavirus and help us all emerge from lockdown. \nThe tech luminary had somehow assumed that I could be an adviser to the project - I made it clear that could not be my role but I was very interested in following its progress.\nNow, nearly three months on, after missing deadline after deadline, there has been a radical change in direction. The app that has been developed so far is being scrapped, and a new approach will be tried based on a system created by Apple and Google. \nBut there is no guarantee when, if ever, this will be rolled out. So what went wrong?\nWhen the team from the NHSX digital division was assembled they were told they were engaged on a vital mission. According to a presentation the team was shown the Covid-19 app would have four aims:\nOnce installed on a user's phone, the app would use Bluetooth to keep a record of other people with whom they came into close contact - as long as they too had installed the app. Then when someone tested positive for the virus, alerts would be sent to their close contacts of recent days telling them to go into quarantine.\nThe epidemiological expertise was provided by a team of Oxford scientists who had argued that there was an urgent need to  identify people who were spreading the virus without knowing. \"Very fast contact tracing was likely to be essential,\" says one of the Oxford team, Dr David Bonsall. \"And smartphones have the technological capability to speed up that process.\"\nBut using the Bluetooth connection on smartphones to detect contacts was untested technology. Still, the team was inspired by Singapore, which had released its Trace Together app using that system.\n\n12 April\n\nHeath Secretary Matt Hancock announces the development of \"a new NHS app for contact tracing\".\n\n5 May\n\nThe app is launched on the Isle of Wight. It is downloaded by 60&comma000 people&comma under half the population of the island&comma over the following 10 days.  Mr Hancock tells BBC Breakfast that if the trial on the Isle of Wight is successful&comma the app will be rolled out nationwide by the middle of May. He also says the public would have a \"duty\" to download the app and that 60% of people in the country would have to do so for the system to function.\n\n20 May\n\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson tells Parliament: \"We will have a test&comma track and trace operation that will be world-beating and yes it will be in place by 1 June.\" He also says there will be 25&comma000 trackers who \"will be able to cope with 10&comma000 new cases a day\".\n\n27 May\n\nContact-tracing system is launched without a nationwide app. Anybody who has been in close contact with someone who has tested positive will have to self-isolate for 14 days. According to government figures&comma in the first week tracers contact 5&comma407 people with the virus.\n\n5 June\n\nBusiness Minister Nadhim Zahawi says the app tested on the Isle of Wight will \"be running as soon as we think it is robust\". Speaking on BBC Question Time&comma the minister says: \"I can't give you an exact date&comma it would be wrong for me to do so.\" Asked to confirm it would be rolled out nationwide this month&comma he says: \"I'd like to think we'd be able to manage by this month&comma yes.\"\n\n17 June\n\nLord Bethell&comma the Minister for Innovation at the Department of Health and Social Care&comma says the app \"isn’t the priority\". Answering a question about the app from the Science and Technology Committee&comma the minister says: \"We are seeking to get something going for the winter&comma but it isn't the priority for us at the moment.\" He declines to offer a launch date for the app.\n\n18 June\n\nIn a major U-turn&comma the UK ditches its version and shifts to a model based on technology provided by Apple and Google. The Apple-Google design is promoted as being more privacy-focused. However&comma it means epidemiologists will have access to less data.\nBut it soon became clear that using Bluetooth was tricky. Reports from Singapore suggested people were reluctant to download the app because it had to be kept open on the phone all the time, draining the battery.\nThen on 10 April came a surprising announcement from Google and Apple. The two tech giants - on whose software virtually all the world's smartphones depend - said they were going to develop a system that would help Bluetooth contact-tracing apps work smoothly. But there was a catch - only privacy-focused apps would be allowed to use the platform.\nApple and Google favoured decentralised apps, where the matching between infected people and their list of contacts happened between their phones. The alternative was for the matching to be done on a central computer, owned by a health authority, which would end up storing lots of very sensitive information.\nThe app the NHS was developing was based on a centralised model, which the Oxford scientists felt was vital if the health service was to be able to monitor virus outbreaks properly.\nTwo days later, with quite a fanfare, Health Secretary Matt Hancock unveiled the plans for the Covid-19 app, promising \"all data will be handled according to the highest ethical and security standards, and would only be used for NHS care and research\". \nBut immediately privacy campaigners, politicians and technology experts raised concerns. \"I recognise the overwhelming force of the public health arguments for a centralised system, but I also have 25 years' experience of the NHS being incompetent at developing systems and repeatedly breaking their privacy promises,\" said Cambridge University's Prof Ross Anderson.\nYet the project was still gathering pace with the first trial of the app at RAF Leeming, in Yorkshire. The trial was held under artificial conditions, with servicemen and women placing phones adjacent to each other on tables to see what happened.\nMeanwhile, privacy-conscious Germany became the latest country to switch its app to the decentralised model, using the Apple and Google system. It seemed that Apple had made it clear that it would not cooperate with a centralised app.\nMichael Veale, a British academic working with a consortium developing decentralised apps, warned that the NHS app was on the wrong path, asking on Twitter \"will the UK push ahead with an app that will not work on iPhones - which has devastated adoption in Singapore?\"\nBut the UK pushed ahead with a trial in the Isle of Wight. As it got underway Mr Hancock told the public they had a \"duty\" to download the app when it became available and that it would be crucial in getting \"our liberty back\" as the lockdown was eased.\nFirst sight of the app showed it was very simple, asking users whether they had a fever or a continuous cough. But any symptom alerts sent out to contacts merely echoed the standard \"stay alert\" advice - test results couldn't be entered into the app at this stage. It left many residents confused.\nStill, the fact that the app was quickly downloaded by more than half of the island's smartphone users saw the government branding the trial a success.\nMeanwhile, the Financial Times revealed that the government had hired a Swiss software developer to build a second app, using the Apple and Google technology. NHS insiders were quick to downplay the significance of this move - although one admitted \"Downing Street is getting nervous\".\nWork continued on a second, more sophisticated version of the original app, which was again going to be tested in the Isle of Wight before a national rollout - though the original deadline of mid-May had been missed.\nOn 20 May, however, it became clear that the government's focus was switching to manual-contact tracing. The prime minister announced that a \"world beating\" tracing system would be in place by the beginning of June, though Number 10 stressed that the app's contribution to the system would come a bit later.\nAs May drew to a close the boss of the wider test and trace programme, Baroness Dido Harding, said the app would be the \"cherry on the cake\" of the project. It was no longer the cake itself.\nBy early June, more deadlines for the national release of the app had come and gone. Three weeks into the Isle of Wight trial residents were getting restless, with very little information on how it was going or when an updated version of the app was coming.\nFrance launched its centralised Stop-Covid app, which had drawn heavy criticism from privacy campaigners, and digital minister Cedric O said 600,000 downloads in the first few hours was \"a good start\".\nOn 4 June, Business Minister Nadhim Zadhawi was coaxed into saying the app should be ready by the end of the month, but that was the last firm deadline that would be promised.\nSingapore, which had continued to struggle to make its contact tracing app work, announced plans to give all citizens a wearable device in the hope that this would do a better job than a smartphone.\nOn 14 June, Germany became the biggest country to launch a decentralised app on the Apple/Google platform. It quickly outstripped France in terms of downloads with something approaching 10% of the population installing it. \nBy now the silence from the UK government about the NHS app was deafening. What was going on?\nAround lunchtime on 18 June all became clear. The BBC broke the story that the government was abandoning the centralised app and moving to something based on Google and Apple's technology. Despite all the spin, the Isle of Wight trial had highlighted a disastrous flaw in the app - it failed to detect 96% of contacts with Apple iPhones.\nThe blame game has already begun. Mr Hancock and some of the scientists working with the NHS believe Apple should have been more cooperative. Technology experts and privacy campaigners say they warned months ago how this story would end.\nApple says it did not know the UK was working on a \"hybrid\" version of the NHS coronavirus contact-tracing app using tech it developed with Google.\nMeanwhile, there is scant proof from anywhere around the world that smartphone apps using Bluetooth are an effective method of contact tracing. Back in March, it seemed that the hugely powerful devices most of us carry with us might help us emerge from this health crisis. Now it looks as though a human being on the end of a phone is a far better option.",

They haven't spoken to us about it.\"\nIt told the BBC it had nothing further to add.\nOn Friday, the Department of Health said the NHS's digital innovation unit had indeed discussed its ambitions with Apple.\n\"NHSX has been working with Google and Apple extensively since their API [application programming interface ] was made available,\" it told the BBC.\n\"Over the last few weeks, senior representatives from NHSX and Apple have had productive meetings to discuss both products and future direction.\n\"There is a commitment between the teams to work together to improve the distance measurement technology, which is integral to have a fully functioning contract-tracing app.\"\nGoogle said yesterday that it welcomed the government's announcement.\nA Downing Street spokesman said the government continued to work closely with both Apple and Google on the app, and had done so since development began.\n\"We've agreed with them to take forward our work on estimating distance through the app that we've developed and work to incorporate that into their app,\" he said.\nApple and Google have not created an app. \nWhat they have built is a software tool which enables contact-tracing apps to work more smoothly with both iPhones and Android devices, but which does not store any data centrally.\nThe UK wanted to store the data as it argued it would be useful for scientists tracking the spread of Covid-19.\nDr David Bonsall from Oxford University, who is an adviser to the NHS app developers, told the BBC the tech giant had made a choice not to support the UK's original model.\n\"Ultimately, a decision was taken by Apple to not support the centralised system that had been in development by the UK from March, and six weeks before they announced their own system under a decentralised model,\" he said.\n\"And that has got to be considered in our reflection on the situation that the UK now faces.\"\nThe now-abandoned NHS app was tested on the Isle of Wight where it was downloaded more than 50,000 times. \nHowever, it registered only about 4% of the iPhones that were nearby.\nIslanders have now been asked to delete it.\nIt's not the first time the government has clashed with Apple over an app - in 2018 an app built to help EU citizens apply to remain in the UK after Brexit was also found to not work properly on iPhones.\nOn that occasion Apple did eventually agree to make the necessary changes to its system.",

        "title": "App row overshadows Apple's annual showcase",
        "description": "Apple is facing mounting pressure over how it runs its app store ahead of its major global developers' conference, which starts on Monday.\nThe firm has been accused of creating \"hostile\" policies within its fee structure, and is dealing with two EU competition probes announced this week.\nBut it is also embroiled in a row with some of its own developers.\nThat has now widened into a debate involving politicians and other major technology firms. \nApple's Worldwide Developers Conference often features new product announcements but is mainly an event for software developers working on Apple's platforms - some of whom are now voicing discontent about its pricing.\nThe argument was ignited in part by an email app called Hey, created by developer David Heinemeier Hansson. It had an update rejected by the Apple app store early this week because it does not allow in-app purchases - from which Apple takes a 30% cut.\nWow. I'm literally stunned. Apple just doubled down on their rejection of HEY's ability to provide bug fixes and new features, unless we submit to their outrageous demand of 15-30% of our revenue. Even worse: We're told that unless we comply, they'll REMOVE THE APP.\nEnd of Twitter post  by @dhh\nMany developers do not offer in-app subscriptions to avoid that levy - or raise the price of in-app subscriptions for the end user.\nBut not all apps are affected, Mr Hansson says. He pointed to email apps from Gmail and Microsoft's Outlook, which he says are treated differently, but which Apple would not discuss with him. \nHey's annual subscription of $99 (£80) is available only directly from the company online, and the app does not tell users where to buy it - so the firm believed it was following all the rules, similar to other email apps.\nBut Apple told him the app should never have been approved in the first place - and could be removed.\n\"If we don't like the deal Apple is offering us - which is to either pay them 30% or get kicked out - what are we going to do about that? Where are we going to go?\" he told the BBC.\n\"If you launch a new piece of software today, and you're not available on the iPhone, you're invisible.\"\nThe cry has now been taken up by others, including blogger John Gruber, whose blog, Daring Fireball, is widely read among Apple developers. He wrote that if Hey's issues were not a mistake, the decision was \"outrageous\".\nSuch issues are behind an anti-competition probe announced by the EU this week, prompted by a complaint from Spotify. The Swedish firm also takes issue with Apple's approach to charging subscriptions and the cut it takes.\nThe anti-competition probe, coinciding with the row over Hey's business model, has snowballed into a much bigger argument.\nMicrosoft President Brad Smith entered the debate, saying that regulators on both sides of the Atlantic should have a \"focused conversation\" about app stores and the rules in place - though he did not mention Apple by name.\nMicrosoft has itself been the subject of competition probes, hit with hefty fines over its dominant market position with Microsoft Windows and its web browser.\nBut he said the restrictions and demands placed on developers today are far higher than anything that existed 20 years ago, at the height of Microsoft's software dominance.\nFacebook, meanwhile, told the New York Times that its Gaming app had been rejected from Apple's app store five times.\nSources who spoke to the newspaper said it might be because the app offers simple games that do not have to be downloaded in the traditional way - through Apple's store.\nEven the chairman of the House antitrust committee - the group of politicians that deals with competition law in the United States - has voiced his concern.\n\"Because of the market power that Apple has, it is charging exorbitant rents - highway robbery, basically - bullying people to pay 30% or denying access to their market,\" David Cicilline told The Verge.\n\"It's crushing small developers who simply can't survive with those kinds of payments. If there were real competition in this marketplace, this wouldn't happen.\"\nThe committee has asked the heads of major tech companies - including Tim Cook at Apple - to attend a session about competition in the tech sector. Mr Cook, it is reported, has yet to agree to attend.\nBut despite the international attention on Apple's policies, its head of marketing, Phil Schiller, told Techcrunch the company was not considering any changes to its rules.",

        "title": "Trump 'racist baby' tweet labelled manipulated",
        "description": "Twitter has labelled a video tweeted by US President Donald Trump as having \"manipulated media\" for the first time.\nThe video shows a black child running away from a white child while playing, with a fake CNN caption.\nThe caption reads: \"Terrified toddler runs from racist baby\", before the video accuses CNN of \"fake news\".\nTwitter's decision to place a large warning label on the video is the latest escalation in a row between Twitter and the president.\nIn late May, Twitter added fact-checking verification notices to the president's tweets for the first time, following up two days later with hiding some tweets behind a warning.\nMr Trump responded by signing an executive order that seeks to curb the long-standing legal protections of social media firms.\nThis latest warning is the first time Twitter has used the \"manipulated media\" warning on one of the president's tweets - designed to indicate the photo or video has been significantly edited.\nIt also comes at a time of increased racial tension in the United States and the resurgence of the Black Lives Matter movement.\nAfter the initial shot of the children running, another caption appears: \"Racist baby probably a Trump voter.\" \npic.twitter.com/vnRpk0zl5y\nEnd of Twitter post  by @realDonaldTrump\nIt then cuts to text promising \"what actually happened\", showing the original context of the two children at play - as CNN did in its original report in September of last year.\n\"America is not the problem. Fake news is,\" the video declares before it ends.\nBut clicking on the prominent warning that Twitter attached to the tweet brings users to a page where Twitter warns: \"The president shared a version of the video which many journalists confirmed was edited and doctored with a fake CNN chyron.\"\nBy Marianna Spring, specialist disinformation reporter\nTwitter has doubled down on its efforts to fact-check misinformation amplified by President Trump in recent weeks. \nIt previously had a more hands-off approach - one that Facebook still favours, although Facebook did remove Trump campaign adverts that featured a Nazi symbol yesterday. \nOne problem for Twitter, however, is consistency. It remains unclear why some misinformation promoted by the US president is tagged, while misleading claims from him and other large Twitter accounts are left unchecked. \nIt's also worth pointing out that this is a clear attack on CNN. The media organisation has frequently found itself a target of Trump's cries of \"fake news\". But in recent weeks, its journalists - and those from other outlets - have also been the target of physical attacks during protests sparked by the death of George Floyd. \nHere, the issue of \"fake news\" quite obviously comes back to President Trump, though. He is plugging it to his millions of followers online. \n\"I think the president was making satirical point that was quite funny if you go and actually watch the video,\" White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany said on Friday.\n\"The point was it was a play on CNN reportedly taking the repeatedly taking him out of context.\"\nCNN's communications department also tweeted back at the president with a terse response.\n\"CNN did cover this story - exactly as it happened. Just as we reported your positions on race (and poll numbers),\" it wrote.\n\"We'll continue working with facts rather than tweeting fake videos that exploit innocent children. We invite you to do the same. Be better.\"\nA watermark on the video in the president's tweet indicates it was originally made by  a pro-Trump Twitter user who goes by the name Carpe Donktum.\n\"Thanks CNN, you gave my video three top 20 (two top five) trending spots,\" he wrote.  \"I haven't had this much fun since you freaked out about the Time Magazine cover!\"\nOn Friday, Facerbook removed the same video after a complaint from after one of the children's parents fielded a copyright claim, CNN reported.\nJukin Media, which owns the rights to the video, said in a statement: \"Neither the video owner nor Jukin Media gave the President permission to post the video, and after our review, we believe that his unauthorised usage of the content is a clear example of copyright infringement without valid fair use or other defense.\"\nAccording to CNN, the video had more than four million views before its removal.",

        "title": "What went wrong with the coronavirus app?",
        "description": "After months of work, the UK has ditched the way its coronavirus-tracing app works, prompting a blame game between the government and two of the world's biggest tech firms. So what went wrong?\nAt the end of March, I got a text from a senior figure in the UK's technology industry. This person said they were helping the NHS \"on a very substantial project that will launch in days and potentially save hundreds of thousands of British lives.\"\nThat was the first I knew of the plan to build a contact tracing app, a project that soon appeared to be at the very centre of the government's strategy to beat coronavirus and help us all emerge from lockdown. \nThe tech luminary had somehow assumed that I could be an adviser to the project - I made it clear that could not be my role but I was very interested in following its progress.\nNow, nearly three months on, after missing deadline after deadline, there has been a radical change in direction. The app that has been developed so far is being scrapped, and a new approach will be tried based on a system created by Apple and Google. \nBut there is no guarantee when, if ever, this will be rolled out. So what went wrong?\nWhen the team from the NHSX digital division was assembled they were told they were engaged on a vital mission. According to a presentation the team was shown the Covid-19 app would have four aims:\nOnce installed on a user's phone, the app would use Bluetooth to keep a record of other people with whom they came into close contact - as long as they too had installed the app. Then when someone tested positive for the virus, alerts would be sent to their close contacts of recent days telling them to go into quarantine.\nThe epidemiological expertise was provided by a team of Oxford scientists who had argued that there was an urgent need to  identify people who were spreading the virus without knowing. \"Very fast contact tracing was likely to be essential,\" says one of the Oxford team, Dr David Bonsall. \"And smartphones have the technological capability to speed up that process.\"\nBut using the Bluetooth connection on smartphones to detect contacts was untested technology. Still, the team was inspired by Singapore, which had released its Trace Together app using that system.\n\n12 April\n\nHeath Secretary Matt Hancock announces the development of \"a new NHS app for contact tracing\".\n\n5 May\n\nThe app is launched on the Isle of Wight. It is downloaded by 60&comma000 people&comma under half the population of the island&comma over the following 10 days.  Mr Hancock tells BBC Breakfast that if the trial on the Isle of Wight is successful&comma the app will be rolled out nationwide by the middle of May. He also says the public would have a \"duty\" to download the app and that 60% of people in the country would have to do so for the system to function.\n\n20 May\n\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson tells Parliament: \"We will have a test&comma track and trace operation that will be world-beating and yes it will be in place by 1 June.\" He also says there will be 25&comma000 trackers who \"will be able to cope with 10&comma000 new cases a day\".\n\n27 May\n\nContact-tracing system is launched without a nationwide app. Anybody who has been in close contact with someone who has tested positive will have to self-isolate for 14 days. According to government figures&comma in the first week tracers contact 5&comma407 people with the virus.\n\n5 June\n\nBusiness Minister Nadhim Zahawi says the app tested on the Isle of Wight will \"be running as soon as we think it is robust\". Speaking on BBC Question Time&comma the minister says: \"I can't give you an exact date&comma it would be wrong for me to do so.\" Asked to confirm it would be rolled out nationwide this month&comma he says: \"I'd like to think we'd be able to manage by this month&comma yes.\"\n\n17 June\n\nLord Bethell&comma the Minister for Innovation at the Department of Health and Social Care&comma says the app \"isn’t the priority\". Answering a question about the app from the Science and Technology Committee&comma the minister says: \"We are seeking to get something going for the winter&comma but it isn't the priority for us at the moment.\" He declines to offer a launch date for the app.\n\n18 June\n\nIn a major U-turn&comma the UK ditches its version and shifts to a model based on technology provided by Apple and Google. The Apple-Google design is promoted as being more privacy-focused. However&comma it means epidemiologists will have access to less data.\nBut it soon became clear that using Bluetooth was tricky. Reports from Singapore suggested people were reluctant to download the app because it had to be kept open on the phone all the time, draining the battery.\nThen on 10 April came a surprising announcement from Google and Apple. The two tech giants - on whose software virtually all the world's smartphones depend - said they were going to develop a system that would help Bluetooth contact-tracing apps work smoothly. But there was a catch - only privacy-focused apps would be allowed to use the platform.\nApple and Google favoured decentralised apps, where the matching between infected people and their list of contacts happened between their phones. The alternative was for the matching to be done on a central computer, owned by a health authority, which would end up storing lots of very sensitive information.\nThe app the NHS was developing was based on a centralised model, which the Oxford scientists felt was vital if the health service was to be able to monitor virus outbreaks properly.\nTwo days later, with quite a fanfare, Health Secretary Matt Hancock unveiled the plans for the Covid-19 app, promising \"all data will be handled according to the highest ethical and security standards, and would only be used for NHS care and research\". \nBut immediately privacy campaigners, politicians and technology experts raised concerns. \"I recognise the overwhelming force of the public health arguments for a centralised system, but I also have 25 years' experience of the NHS being incompetent at developing systems and repeatedly breaking their privacy promises,\" said Cambridge University's Prof Ross Anderson.\nYet the project was still gathering pace with the first trial of the app at RAF Leeming, in Yorkshire. The trial was held under artificial conditions, with servicemen and women placing phones adjacent to each other on tables to see what happened.\nMeanwhile, privacy-conscious Germany became the latest country to switch its app to the decentralised model, using the Apple and Google system. It seemed that Apple had made it clear that it would not cooperate with a centralised app.\nMichael Veale, a British academic working with a consortium developing decentralised apps, warned that the NHS app was on the wrong path, asking on Twitter \"will the UK push ahead with an app that will not work on iPhones - which has devastated adoption in Singapore?\"\nBut the UK pushed ahead with a trial in the Isle of Wight. As it got underway Mr Hancock told the public they had a \"duty\" to download the app when it became available and that it would be crucial in getting \"our liberty back\" as the lockdown was eased.\nFirst sight of the app showed it was very simple, asking users whether they had a fever or a continuous cough. But any symptom alerts sent out to contacts merely echoed the standard \"stay alert\" advice - test results couldn't be entered into the app at this stage. It left many residents confused.\nStill, the fact that the app was quickly downloaded by more than half of the island's smartphone users saw the government branding the trial a success.\nMeanwhile, the Financial Times revealed that the government had hired a Swiss software developer to build a second app, using the Apple and Google technology. NHS insiders were quick to downplay the significance of this move - although one admitted \"Downing Street is getting nervous\".\nWork continued on a second, more sophisticated version of the original app, which was again going to be tested in the Isle of Wight before a national rollout - though the original deadline of mid-May had been missed.\nOn 20 May, however, it became clear that the government's focus was switching to manual-contact tracing. The prime minister announced that a \"world beating\" tracing system would be in place by the beginning of June, though Number 10 stressed that the app's contribution to the system would come a bit later.\nAs May drew to a close the boss of the wider test and trace programme, Baroness Dido Harding, said the app would be the \"cherry on the cake\" of the project. It was no longer the cake itself.\nBy early June, more deadlines for the national release of the app had come and gone. Three weeks into the Isle of Wight trial residents were getting restless, with very little information on how it was going or when an updated version of the app was coming.\nFrance launched its centralised Stop-Covid app, which had drawn heavy criticism from privacy campaigners, and digital minister Cedric O said 600,000 downloads in the first few hours was \"a good start\".\nOn 4 June, Business Minister Nadhim Zadhawi was coaxed into saying the app should be ready by the end of the month, but that was the last firm deadline that would be promised.\nSingapore, which had continued to struggle to make its contact tracing app work, announced plans to give all citizens a wearable device in the hope that this would do a better job than a smartphone.\nOn 14 June, Germany became the biggest country to launch a decentralised app on the Apple/Google platform. It quickly outstripped France in terms of downloads with something approaching 10% of the population installing it. \nBy now the silence from the UK government about the NHS app was deafening. What was going on?\nAround lunchtime on 18 June all became clear. The BBC broke the story that the government was abandoning the centralised app and moving to something based on Google and Apple's technology. Despite all the spin, the Isle of Wight trial had highlighted a disastrous flaw in the app - it failed to detect 96% of contacts with Apple iPhones.\nThe blame game has already begun. Mr Hancock and some of the scientists working with the NHS believe Apple should have been more cooperative. Technology experts and privacy campaigners say they warned months ago how this story would end.\nApple says it did not know the UK was working on a \"hybrid\" version of the NHS coronavirus contact-tracing app using tech it developed with Google.\nMeanwhile, there is scant proof from anywhere around the world that smartphone apps using Bluetooth are an effective method of contact tracing. Back in March, it seemed that the hugely powerful devices most of us carry with us might help us emerge from this health crisis. Now it looks as though a human being on the end of a phone is a far better option.",

They haven't spoken to us about it.\"\nIt told the BBC it had nothing further to add.\nOn Friday, the Department of Health said the NHS's digital innovation unit had indeed discussed its ambitions with Apple.\n\"NHSX has been working with Google and Apple extensively since their API [application programming interface ] was made available,\" it told the BBC.\n\"Over the last few weeks, senior representatives from NHSX and Apple have had productive meetings to discuss both products and future direction.\n\"There is a commitment between the teams to work together to improve the distance measurement technology, which is integral to have a fully functioning contract-tracing app.\"\nGoogle said yesterday that it welcomed the government's announcement.\nA Downing Street spokesman said the government continued to work closely with both Apple and Google on the app, and had done so since development began.\n\"We've agreed with them to take forward our work on estimating distance through the app that we've developed and work to incorporate that into their app,\" he said.\nApple and Google have not created an app. \nWhat they have built is a software tool which enables contact-tracing apps to work more smoothly with both iPhones and Android devices, but which does not store any data centrally.\nThe UK wanted to store the data as it argued it would be useful for scientists tracking the spread of Covid-19.\nDr David Bonsall from Oxford University, who is an adviser to the NHS app developers, told the BBC the tech giant had made a choice not to support the UK's original model.\n\"Ultimately, a decision was taken by Apple to not support the centralised system that had been in development by the UK from March, and six weeks before they announced their own system under a decentralised model,\" he said.\n\"And that has got to be considered in our reflection on the situation that the UK now faces.\"\nThe now-abandoned NHS app was tested on the Isle of Wight where it was downloaded more than 50,000 times. \nHowever, it registered only about 4% of the iPhones that were nearby.\nIslanders have now been asked to delete it.\nIt's not the first time the government has clashed with Apple over an app - in 2018 an app built to help EU citizens apply to remain in the UK after Brexit was also found to not work properly on iPhones.\nOn that occasion Apple did eventually agree to make the necessary changes to its system.",

        "title": "App row overshadows Apple's annual showcase",
        "description": "Apple is facing mounting pressure over how it runs its app store ahead of its major global developers' conference, which starts on Monday.\nThe firm has been accused of creating \"hostile\" policies within its fee structure, and is dealing with two EU competition probes announced this week.\nBut it is also embroiled in a row with some of its own developers.\nThat has now widened into a debate involving politicians and other major technology firms. \nApple's Worldwide Developers Conference often features new product announcements but is mainly an event for software developers working on Apple's platforms - some of whom are now voicing discontent about its pricing.\nThe argument was ignited in part by an email app called Hey, created by developer David Heinemeier Hansson. It had an update rejected by the Apple app store early this week because it does not allow in-app purchases - from which Apple takes a 30% cut.\nMany developers do not offer in-app subscriptions to avoid that levy - or raise the price of in-app subscriptions for the end user.\nBut not all apps are affected, Mr Hansson says. He pointed to email apps from Gmail and Microsoft's Outlook, which he says are treated differently, but which Apple would not discuss with him. \nHey's annual subscription of $99 (£80) is available only directly from the company online, and the app does not tell users where to buy it - so the firm believed it was following all the rules, similar to other email apps.\nBut Apple told him the app should never have been approved in the first place - and could be removed.\n\"If we don't like the deal Apple is offering us - which is to either pay them 30% or get kicked out - what are we going to do about that? Where are we going to go?\" he told the BBC.\n\"If you launch a new piece of software today, and you're not available on the iPhone, you're invisible.\"\nThe cry has now been taken up by others, including blogger John Gruber, whose blog, Daring Fireball, is widely read among Apple developers. He wrote that if Hey's issues were not a mistake, the decision was \"outrageous\".\nSuch issues are behind an anti-competition probe announced by the EU this week, prompted by a complaint from Spotify. The Swedish firm also takes issue with Apple's approach to charging subscriptions and the cut it takes.\nThe anti-competition probe, coinciding with the row over Hey's business model, has snowballed into a much bigger argument.\nMicrosoft President Brad Smith entered the debate, saying that regulators on both sides of the Atlantic should have a \"focused conversation\" about app stores and the rules in place - though he did not mention Apple by name.\nMicrosoft has itself been the subject of competition probes, hit with hefty fines over its dominant market position with Microsoft Windows and its web browser.\nBut he said the restrictions and demands placed on developers today are far higher than anything that existed 20 years ago, at the height of Microsoft's software dominance.\nFacebook, meanwhile, told the New York Times that its Gaming app had been rejected from Apple's app store five times.\nSources who spoke to the newspaper said it might be because the app offers simple games that do not have to be downloaded in the traditional way - through Apple's store.\nEven the chairman of the House antitrust committee - the group of politicians that deals with competition law in the United States - has voiced his concern.\n\"Because of the market power that Apple has, it is charging exorbitant rents - highway robbery, basically - bullying people to pay 30% or denying access to their market,\" David Cicilline told The Verge.\n\"It's crushing small developers who simply can't survive with those kinds of payments. If there were real competition in this marketplace, this wouldn't happen.\"\nThe committee has asked the heads of major tech companies - including Tim Cook at Apple - to attend a session about competition in the tech sector. Mr Cook, it is reported, has yet to agree to attend.\nBut despite the international attention on Apple's policies, its head of marketing, Phil Schiller, told Techcrunch the company was not considering any changes to its rules.",

        "title": "Trump 'racist baby' tweet labelled manipulated",
        "description": "Twitter has labelled a video tweeted by US President Donald Trump as having \"manipulated media\" for the first time.\nThe video shows a black child running away from a white child while playing, with a fake CNN caption.\nThe caption reads: \"Terrified toddler runs from racist baby\", before the video accuses CNN of \"fake news\".\nTwitter's decision to place a large warning label on the video is the latest escalation in a row between Twitter and the president.\nIn late May, Twitter added fact-checking verification notices to the president's tweets for the first time, following up two days later with hiding some tweets behind a warning.\nMr Trump responded by signing an executive order that seeks to curb the long-standing legal protections of social media firms.\nThis latest warning is the first time Twitter has used the \"manipulated media\" warning on one of the president's tweets - designed to indicate the photo or video has been significantly edited.\nIt also comes at a time of increased racial tension in the United States and the resurgence of the Black Lives Matter movement.\nAfter the initial shot of the children running, another caption appears: \"Racist baby probably a Trump voter.\" \nIt then cuts to text promising \"what actually happened\", showing the original context of the two children at play - as CNN did in its original report in September of last year.\n\"America is not the problem. Fake news is,\" the video declares before it ends.\nBut clicking on the prominent warning that Twitter attached to the tweet brings users to a page where Twitter warns: \"The president shared a version of the video which many journalists confirmed was edited and doctored with a fake CNN chyron.\"\nBy Marianna Spring, specialist disinformation reporter\nTwitter has doubled down on its efforts to fact-check misinformation amplified by President Trump in recent weeks. \nIt previously had a more hands-off approach - one that Facebook still favours, although Facebook did remove Trump campaign adverts that featured a Nazi symbol yesterday. \nOne problem for Twitter, however, is consistency. It remains unclear why some misinformation promoted by the US president is tagged, while misleading claims from him and other large Twitter accounts are left unchecked. \nIt's also worth pointing out that this is a clear attack on CNN. The media organisation has frequently found itself a target of Trump's cries of \"fake news\". But in recent weeks, its journalists - and those from other outlets - have also been the target of physical attacks during protests sparked by the death of George Floyd. \nHere, the issue of \"fake news\" quite obviously comes back to President Trump, though. He is plugging it to his millions of followers online. \n\"I think the president was making satirical point that was quite funny if you go and actually watch the video,\" White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany said on Friday.\n\"The point was it was a play on CNN reportedly taking the repeatedly taking him out of context.\"\nCNN's communications department also tweeted back at the president with a terse response.\n\"CNN did cover this story - exactly as it happened. Just as we reported your positions on race (and poll numbers),\" it wrote.\n\"We'll continue working with facts rather than tweeting fake videos that exploit innocent children. We invite you to do the same. Be better.\"\nA watermark on the video in the president's tweet indicates it was originally made by  a pro-Trump Twitter user who goes by the name Carpe Donktum.\n\"Thanks CNN, you gave my video three top 20 (two top five) trending spots,\" he wrote.  \"I haven't had this much fun since you freaked out about the Time Magazine cover!\"\nOn Friday, Facerbook removed the same video after a complaint from after one of the children's parents fielded a copyright claim, CNN reported.\nJukin Media, which owns the rights to the video, said in a statement: \"Neither the video owner nor Jukin Media gave the President permission to post the video, and after our review, we believe that his unauthorised usage of the content is a clear example of copyright infringement without valid fair use or other defense.\"\nAccording to CNN, the video had more than four million views before its removal.",

        "description": "A Covid-19 tracing software tool has appeared in the settings of both Android phones and iPhones as part of an update of their operating systems.\nThe \"exposure notification\" tool is switched off by default, and is not a tracing app itself.\nIt enables an app to run in the background while still using Bluetooth.\nThis lets the app measure the distance between two handsets - and then alert the phone owner if someone near them later tests positive for Covid-19.\nIn the UK there is currently no available contact-tracing app.\nThe update has caused some confusion, with people querying the new addition to their handsets on social media.\n\"This is not a new app but is an extra element added to the phones' operating systems to enable approved developers to build apps that can potentially warn of proximity to infected individuals,\" said computer scientist Prof Alan Woodward, of Surrey University.\n\"Only apps approved by Google and Apple will be included in their app stores where they try to make use of this facility.\"\nOn iPhones it's found in the settings app, via the privacy menu and then health sub-section. On Android phones it's in the Google (services and preferences) section of the settings menu.\nIt does not work with the popular Covid Symptom Study app, which has been downloaded more than 3m times.\nA team of NHS developers had built a contact-tracing app and trialled it on the Isle of Wight but the UK government is now planning to incorporate software developed by Apple and Google.\nThis tool is part of that collaboration between the tech giants.\nIt enables handsets to exchange data and alert people if they have been near someone who is found to have coronavirus.\nHowever that data is not stored anywhere centrally - which was what the UK initially wanted to do.

        "description": "On this week's Tech Tent, the battle between Apple and its developers over the commission it charges to use its App Store.\nThe tech giant says everyone's a winner from its hugely lucrative store which generated $0.5bn (£0.4bn) in revenue last year, benefitting all those developers who created millions of apps.\nBut in the week the EU mounted an investigation into whether Apple was abusing its position by charging 30% commission on app purchases, we hear from one small developer making a big noise.\nDavid Heinmeier Hansson, chief technology officer of Basecamp, tells us about his firm's dispute with the tech giant over the app for their new subscription email service Hey.  \nApple is threatening to remove the app from the store unless it includes an in-app purchase option from which it would take a 30% cut of all revenues.\nHe says most small developers are afraid to tangle with the company on which their livelihood depends: \"When Apple shows up with outrageous demands they keep quiet and they try to resolve it. We're not going to do that. We're not going to keep quiet and we're not going to pay.\" \nApple is not commenting but is quietly pointing to a clause in its terms and conditions saying developers have to offer in-app purchases.\nAlso on today's programme, after a week which has seen Germany launch a decentralised contact tracing app and the UK government decide to ditch its centralised version we hear that the technology for either approach might not be fit for purpose.\nContact tracing apps use Bluetooth to measure the distance between people and Professor Stephen Farrell and Professor Doug Leith of Trinity College Dublin have been testing its accuracy.  \nSo how does it do? \n\"It's pretty bad, that's the bottom line,\" says Professor Farrell. \nIn tests on a bus, for instance,  they found that someone 4m (13 ft) away sometimes appeared closer than a person 2m away.\nThat kind of reading could see someone sent into quarantine without a good reason while another person who might need to be self-isolating would not get an alert. \nCountries around the world have been trying this high tech approach to contact tracing - but it could all turn out to have been a pipe dream.",

        "title": "Tech takeovers feed into China Cold War fears",
        "description": "The UK government is planning new measures to restrict foreign takeovers on national security grounds. \nBut security experts caution the UK has been late to the issue. \nIt comes amid growing concern about the risk of China buying high-tech companies, especially in the economic turmoil resulting from the coronavirus pandemic.\nAt the height of the crisis, a boardroom manoeuvre nearly went unnoticed. \nAnd it flared up into a row that goes to the heart of on an increasingly contentious issue - has the UK failed to stop high-tech industries passing into Chinese hands?\nIn 2017, Imagination Technologies, a Hertfordshire-based company at the cutting edge of computer-chip design, whose tech is used on iPhones, was bought by Canyon Bridge Partners, a private equity firm based in the Cayman Islands. \nBut 99% of the funds for the purchase came from China Reform, backed by the state in Beijing.  \nAnd this spring, Canyon Bridge Partners tried to install new directors linked to China Reform.\nOne of those to raise the alarm, Sir Hossein Yassaie, a former chief executive of the company, feared assurances it would not be moved to China were at risk of being broken. \n\"It looked like there was an attempt to basically change the ownership and control of the company,\" he told a documentary made for BBC Radio 4 .\n\"My stance on Imagination is fundamentally about making sure a very important ecosystem... is maintained as an independent, properly governed supplier.\"\nThe issue was taken up by Tom Tugendhat MP, who chairs the Foreign Affairs Select Committee, which held a hearing in May. \nCanyon Bridge denied China had any untoward influence over the purchase or its activities, arguing the decisions were purely commercial.\nAnd some of the changes were halted. \nBut those involved believe it was an indication of a wider problem.\n\"This is just part of an incremental process where technology is being moved out of the UK, and out of the West, and towards China,\" Mr Tugendhat says.\nHas the UK been too ready to allow some of its \"crown jewel\" technology companies to be sold into foreign hands?  \n\"The simple answer unfortunately is, 'Yes.'\" Sir Hossein says.\nAnd Elisabeth Braw, of the Royal United Services Institute think tank, believes many other cases in which cutting edge technology have shifted to China have gone unreported.  \n\"The UK has been late to understand this,\" she says. \n\"It sort of goes against this idea that globalisation is a force for good, if you start saying, 'Well, we need to scrutinise foreign investors.'\nBut actually the world has changed and China is exploiting globalisation for its own gains.\"\nTheresa May's government announced plans to look at the issue in 2018.\nA bill promising new powers to assess mergers and takeovers was promised in the Queen's Speech last December. \nAnd in May, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said parliamentarians were \"right to be concerned\" about the buying up of UK technology by countries that had \"ulterior motives\", and promised new measures in the coming weeks.\nOthers have already acted. \nThe purchase of a robotics manufacturer by a Chinese company led Germany in 2017 to place new restrictions on takeovers.\nUS intelligence officials have also increasingly focused on looking for a hidden hand from the Chinese state in business deals.\n\"You might see an acquisition and on its face it makes all the sense in the world,\" US National Counterintelligence and Security Center director Bill Evanina told BBC News.\n\"But there needs to be intelligence services peeling back that onion to identify who the backdoor owners are and who the financiers of that acquisition are.\"\nMr Evanina says that, after having been \"a little bit slow, in the last two to three years\", the US government has become more active in warning the private sector. \nIn the UK, MI5 plays a similar role and informs decisions about whether technology takeovers are in the national interest - but few have been stopped.\nOne of the more surprising rows came after the gay dating site Grindr was purchased by a Chinese company. \nThe US raised national security concerns because of the fear the personal data could be used to compromise or influence individuals.\nAnd the company was eventually sold. \n\"The regulator realised that having that information at the disposal of the Chinese government ultimately was a very bad idea for US national security,\" Ms Braw says.\n\"We need to change our understanding of which companies are vital to national security and treat them just like we treated defence companies in the Cold War\". \nOne concern for Mr Evanina is the extent to which China can use a combination of acquisitions, its own technology companies and cyber-espionage to build up large databases of personal information. \n\"The ability to have information on every human in the world that that human doesn't even have on themselves provides them with a strategic advantage, not only from an espionage perspective but a compromise perspective [and] understanding plans and intentions of companies,\" he says.\nThe New Tech Cold War will be broadcast on BBC Radio 4 at 11:00 on Friday and again on Tuesday at 16:00",

        "description": "Fifa game developer EA Sports promises that the next-generation version of Fifa 21 will feature new technology to make it the most realistic yet.\nNext year's entry will release for both existing consoles and the new Xbox Series X and Playstation 5.\nBut EA says the newer consoles will take advantage of more advanced technology.\nThe Fifa series remains one of the most popular video game franchises in the world.\nDespite regular criticism that the annual game is often very similar to the previous year's entry, it had sold over 260 million copies as of 2018. \nEA says its newest title will feature more life-like player movements, which it says will be \"the most authentic character behaviours ever seen in sports video games\". \nThe next-generation editions will feature significantly reduced loading times, with the PS5 version taking advantage of haptic feedback on the console's DualSense controller. New rendering and lighting techniques will also help to increase the overall realism of the game, EA promises.\nAnd fans within the stadium will also be more interactive, even participating in celebrations.\nFifa 21 will be released worldwide in October, before the new consoles launch. \nThe PS5 and Xbox Series X versions, with their advanced features, will be available later - but EA is offering a free upgrade path to players who buy the game on the previous generation early.\nHowever, Nintendo Switch gamers will not get to experience any of the franchise's new models or gameplay innovations.\nThe lower-powered portable console will instead get a \"legacy edition\" release that will include only new kits and teams and an updated menu and overlay system. \nBut EA's promise to deliver its most realistic experience yet could disappoint some fans after some critics suggested Fifa 20's new level of realism had made the game less enjoyable.\nDetails about the game's career mode or five-a-side Volta mode have yet to be announced.\nHowever, EA has promised to reveal more about the game in the coming months.

        "title": "Facebook removes Trump ad over 'Nazi hate symbol'",
        "description": "Facebook says it has removed adverts for US President Donald Trump's re-election campaign that featured a symbol used in Nazi Germany. \nThe company said the offending ad contained an inverted red triangle similar to that used by the Nazis to label opponents such as communists.\nMr Trump's campaign team said they were aimed at the far-left activist group antifa, which it said uses the symbol. \nFacebook said the ads violated its policy against organised hate.\n\"We don't allow symbols that represent hateful organisations or hateful ideologies unless they are put up with context or condemnation,\" the social network's head of security policy, Nathaniel Gleicher, said on Thursday.\nHe added: \"That's what we saw in this case with this ad, and anywhere that that symbol is used we would take the same actions.\"\nThe ads, which were posted on the site on pages belonging to President Trump and Vice-President Mike Pence, were online for about 24 hours and had received hundreds of thousands of views before they were taken down. \n\"The inverted red triangle is a symbol used by antifa, so it was included in an ad about antifa,\" Tim Murtaugh, a spokesman for the Trump campaign, said in a statement.\n\"We would note that Facebook still has an inverted red triangle emoji in use, which looks exactly the same,\" he added. \nMr Trump has recently accused antifa of starting riots at street protests across the US over the death in police custody of African American George Floyd. \nThe president said last month that he would designate the anti-fascist group a \"domestic terrorist organisation\", although legal experts have questioned his authority to do so.\nAntifa is a loose affiliation of mostly far-left activists that oppose neo-Nazis, fascism, white supremacists and racism. \nMost members decry what they see as the nationalistic, anti-immigration and anti-Muslim policies of Mr Trump.\nBy James Clayton, Technology Reporter, BBC North America\nThis is the latest salvo in an increasingly fraught relationship between the technology giants and the White House. \nLast month, Twitter put a warning on one of the president's tweets about rioting in Minneapolis - saying it had \"glorified violence\". \nMr Trump hit back by talking about the \"unchecked power\" of big tech. He said that Section 230 - a law that protects social media companies from being legally responsible for the online content of users - should be revoked. \nBut forget Twitter for now, Facebook is the platform that Mr Trump really cares about. The social network is where a majority of his online political advertising budget goes. The move will likely infuriate the president. It also acts as a warning that Facebook does - and will - moderate some political content. \nAs the 2020 election draws nearer, it's likely more and more focus will be placed on what it does - and does not - take down. \nEarlier this month, Facebook employees spoke out against the tech giant's decision not to remove or flag a controversial post by Mr Trump relating to the protests over Mr Floyd's death. \nThe president posted a comment on the social network saying that he would \"send in the National Guard\" and warned that \"when the looting starts, the shooting starts\". But Facebook said it did not violate its company policy.\nMr Trump had tweeted the same comments, but Twitter placed a warning over the content, which it said \"glorified violence\".\nSome Facebook staff said they were \"ashamed\".",

        "title": "UK virus-tracing app switches to Apple-Google model",
        "description": "In a major U-turn, the UK is ditching the way its current coronavirus-tracing app works and shifting to a model based on technology provided by Apple and Google.\nThe Apple-Google design has been promoted as being more privacy-focused.\nHowever, it means epidemiologists will have access to less data.\nThe government now intends to launch an app in the autumn, however it says the product may not involve contact tracing at that point.\nInstead the software may be limited to enabling users to report their symptoms and order a test.\nBaroness Dido Harding - who heads up the wider Test and Trace programme - will only give the green light to actually deploying the Apple-Google technology if she judges it to be fit for purpose, which she does not believe is the case at present. It is possible this may never happen.\nGermany, Italy and Denmark are among other countries to have switched from a so-called \"centralised\" approach to a \"decentralised\" one.\nThe NHS has been testing both systems against each other, over the course of the past month.\nThe centralised version trialled on the Isle of Wight worked well at assessing the distance between two users, but was poor at recognising Apple's iPhones.\nSpecifically, the software registered about 75% of nearby Android handsets but only 4% of iPhones.\nBy contrast, the Apple-Google model logged 99% of both Android mobiles and iPhones. But its distance calculations were weaker. \nIn some instances, it could not differentiate between a phone in a user's pocket 1m (3.3ft) away and a phone in a user's hand 3m (9.8ft) away.\nExperiments in Ireland have flagged a similar issue.\nAt the Downing Street briefing, Health Secretary Matt Hancock suggested the original plan might have worked had it not been for Apple's restrictions on third-party apps' use of Bluetooth.\n\"Apple software prevents iPhones being used effectively for contact tracing unless you're using Apple's own technology,\" he said.\n\"Our app won't work because Apple won't change that system... and their app can't measure distance well enough to a standard that we are satisfied with.\n\"What matters is what works. Because what works will save lives.\"\nBaroness Harding added: \"What we've done in really rigorously testing both our own Covid-19 app and the Google-Apple version is demonstrate that none of them are working sufficiently well enough to be actually reliable to determine whether any of us should self-isolate for two weeks [and] that's true across the world.\"\nIn response, Google noted that it and Apple had developed an application programming interface - a set of functions and procedures for others to build on - rather than a fully-fledged app.\n\"We have developed an Exposure Notification API with Apple based on consultation with public health experts around the world, including in the UK, to ensure that our efforts are useful to authorities as they build their own apps to limit the spread of Covid-19, while ensuring privacy and security are central to the design,\" added a spokeswoman.\nThe latest developments come a day after the BBC revealed that a former Apple executive, Simon Thompson, was taking charge of the late-running project as part of Baroness Harding's team.\nContact-tracing apps are designed to help prevent a second wave of the coronavirus.\nThey work by logging when two people have been in close proximity to each other for a substantial period of time.\nIf one of the users is later diagnosed as having the disease, an alert can be sent to others they have recently been close to, telling them that they should also get tested and/or self-isolate.\nThe UK's previous \"centralised\" design carried out the contact-matches on a remote server.\nThe Apple-Google model carries the process out on the handsets themselves, making it more difficult for the authorities or potentially hackers to de-anonymise the records and use them for other means.\nOne advantage of the switch - if deployed - is that the NHS Covid-19 app would be able to overcome a limitation of iPhones and carry out Bluetooth \"handshakes\" when the software is running in the background.\nAnother is that it should be easier to make the app compatible with other countries' counterparts, which are based on the same system - including the Republic of Ireland and Germany.\nEarlier in the week, the European Commission said that France - which had adopted a centralised app - would face challenges in this regard.\n\"This is a welcome, if a heavily and unnecessarily delayed, move,\" commented Dr Michael Veale from the DP3T group, which promotes the decentralised model.\n\"The Google-Apple system in a way is home-grown: originating with research at a large consortium of universities led by Switzerland and including UCL in the UK.\"\nHe added that developers should be able to adapt code already being used by Germany and Switzerland if required.\nIf Baroness Harding decides the Apple-Google tech is never good enough to roll out, then another alternative might be a system based on wearable tech.\nSingapore recently ordered 300,000 dongles to test as an alternative. Rather than uploading data over the internet, users will physically hand them over if they test positive for the virus, allowing recent contacts to be flagged.\nBaroness Harding's team is monitoring it and other innovations, but for now intends to focus on manual contact tracing carried out by humans.\nWhile the government is still set to launch an app of some kind across England, health is a devolved issue.\nAs a consequence, Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales have still to commit to the initiative.\n\"We will continue to work with the UK government to gather the information we need on data integration, technical information and overall timescales before making any decisions on whether or not to support its use,\" a spokesman for the Scottish government told the BBC.\nA spokeswoman for the Northern Ireland Executive added: \"People in Northern Ireland already have access to a symptom checker and advice app called Covid-19 NI, which more than 50,000 have downloaded and use regularly. This helps people to improve access to information, particularly when they have been advised to self-isolate.\"",

        "title": "Have we become too reliant on Big Tech firms?",
        "description": "\"We wouldn't have survived without Amazon,\" says Keith Ingram, owner of vinyl records shop Assai Records.\nWhen lockdown hit on 23 March in the UK, Mr Ingram had to shut his shops in Edinburgh and Dundee, and sell his stock through Amazon Marketplace. Now, his sales are 40% higher than last year. \n\"Without Amazon, we would have had to furlough all employees for all of lockdown. Instead, we furloughed them for four weeks until we adjusted ourselves to the new normal, and then we could retrain staff to help us fulfil our online orders,\" he says.\nIt's not just Amazon that has been used more during the pandemic. Apple and Android smartphones and tablets, Facebook's apps and Microsoft tools have provided crucial links with friends, family and colleagues.\nAnd that's certainly been great for investors and the billionaires behind these firms. Shares in Facebook, Apple, Amazon and Microsoft all hit all-time highs on the stock market in June.\nBetween 18 March and 19 May, Amazon's Jeff Bezos saw his wealth swell by $34.6bn (£27.6bn) and Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg's wealth rose by $25bn (£19.9bn), according to a recent report.\nBut is this reliance on Big Tech getting out of control? \n\"Amazon have gone from being the dominant gatekeepers for online commerce to being the dominant gatekeeper for much of retail because of the lockdowns,\" says Stacy Mitchell, co-director of the Institute for Local Self-Reliance, the US organisation that challenges concentrated economic and political power.\nMeanwhile, this week the UK government announced that it would be using a coronavirus-tracing app based on technology from Apple and Google.\nGermany, Italy and Denmark are among other countries also using that system.\nBig Tech firms have been getting even bigger during the pandemic and their success means they have plenty of funds to snap up other businesses.\nFor example, in May Facebook announced its second biggest deal - a plan to buy a 10% stake in India's Jio, a telecoms and digital services business.\n\"All of them will be in the M&A [mergers and acquisitions] game if they're not already. Start-ups are more likely to sell out during the pandemic when they might struggle to meet their obligations and the buyout looks especially attractive - the pandemic is speeding up the buyout date in some cases,\" says Sandeep Vaheesan, legal director at the Open Markets Institute, a think-tank that studies corporate concentration.\nBefore the pandemic, there had been scrutiny on Big Tech. The US House Judiciary antitrust subcommittee sent requests for information to Amazon, Apple, Google owner Alphabet and Facebook in September 2019, with the government concerned that only a small number of companies hold such a big share of the digital market.\nCoronavirus may have delayed these investigations, but they will still be carried out.\n\"Those focused on antitrust will renew their attention on big tech companies because we're in an election year [in the US] and both parties are going to want the attention on their efforts to regulate business,\" says Jonathan Osborne, a lawyer from Globalaw's law firm Gunster. \nMr Vaheesan warns that in the US, the Department of Justice (DoJ) and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) have not taken company acquisitions seriously enough - clearing the acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp by Facebook, and YouTube and Android by Google.\nHe is not optimistic that the DoJ and the FTC will change their approach in the future.\nIn the UK, Amazon's multi-million pound investment in Deliveroo was provisionally cleared by competition chiefs because the takeaway courier said it would collapse if it was blocked. A final ruling is due on 6 August. \n\"That was a one-off, the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) looked at the market circumstances and saw them changing because of the pandemic, but the pandemic is not a reason for Big Tech companies to get away with scrutiny - absolutely not,\" says Jonathan Branton, head of competition at law firm DWF.\nThe CMA has since announced it is investigating Facebook's acquisition of Giphy, the popular owner of a library of short animations and stickers used in social media.\nMore Technology of Business\nBut is the current level of scrutiny enough, and will it change because of the pandemic?\n\"It's hard to look into a crystal ball. I think Microsoft has taken a strong stance on trust, security and ethical use of AI, and while we've been focusing more on the crisis response in the short term, we still maintain and apply these principles and they will apply in the future. It's then about how public, industry and government look at that across the usage of Big Tech in the market,\" says Microsoft's Azure business lead Michael Wignall.\nMr Vaheesan suggests that these major investigations into tech companies may not be what they seem.\n\"It's too soon to say whether these are serious inquiries or whether they're merely a window dressing responding to the public and political concerns about the power of the big five tech companies.\"\nIn the US the picture is further complicated by President Trump's fraught relationship with Twitter.\nIn May, for the first time, the company attached fact-check links to the President's tweets.\nThat prompted a furious response from the White House with the President threatening to \"strongly regulate\" or even \"close down\" social media firms.\nFacebook has also been under pressure to remove comments made by the President, but has so far kept his posts up.\nTo help protect their interests, the Big Tech firms have hundreds of lobbyists working in Washington.\n\"When I meet with elected representatives in Washington DC, they're almost a bit bereft that there are more lobbyists than they have staffers to write this legislation,\" says Scott Galloway, professor of marketing at NYU Stern.\n\"The budgets at DoJ and the FTC have been cut every year, so although there's more likely to be anti-trust action with a change in the White House, the question is whether the US government even has the resources anymore,\" says Mr Galloway. \nMr Galloway believes that Europe is more likely to take the lead on tougher sanctions against Big Tech than the US. \n\"Europe gets all of the downside of big tech... but they get very little of the upside. In the US, these are tremendous economic engines, providing a lot of jobs and a source of pride - they create that ecosystem of other successful companies around them,\" he says.\nThe European Commission announced two new antitrust investigations into Apple this week, while a recent Wall Street Journal report suggested that Amazon could be next on the EU's agenda, over its treatment of third party sellers.\n\"It raises the question: why are we so dependent on a handful of large companies? Would we actually lose anything as a society if we had multiple online marketplaces? There's really nothing that compels us to accept the present structure of these markets,\" says Mr Vaheesan. \nBig tech may be getting stronger during the pandemic, but it may actually make things harder for them in the long term.\nAmazon, Facebook, Apple and Alphabet were asked for a response but declined to comment.

        "title": "Last of Us 2: Gaming 'just grew up'",
        "description": "The abandoned house is pitch black, except for the dim circle of light squeezing out of your torch. \nAs you sneak past the moth-bitten sofa, broken television and toppled chest of drawers, suddenly you realise you're not alone. \nThe sound of pained screeching and clicking pierces the silence and, seemingly out of nowhere, a hunched figure with its limbs at unnatural angles, starts shuffling towards you.\nNow you - or rather Ellie, your character - has a decision to make. Try to kill it, or run?\nBrought to life by actress Ashley Johnson, Ellie is one of the most famous characters in gaming's recent history.\nAshley first auditioned for the role in 2012 and tells us: \"I am so unbelievably proud to play this character. \n\"I love Ellie and think it's very important for people to see characters like her in video games.\"\n\"To have a young female lead that is gay makes it feel real.\"\nThe Last of Us Part 2 is the follow-up to the critically acclaimed Last of Us - a game that review aggregator Metacritic ranks at 95 out of 100.\nIt followed the story of the then teenage girl Ellie and her smuggler protector Joel. \nThey travelled across the US as scientists tried to develop a cure for an infection that turned half the world into zombie-like creatures and led to the breakdown of society.\nIts ending kept gamers and critics talking for a long time and the sequel picks up Ellie and Joel's story a few years later.\nAshley describes Ellie as \"someone who's a little quiet at times and a little shy, but also extremely capable\".\nThe new game is focused on her and a diverse cast of characters.\nThere's a trans person, people from diverse ethnic backgrounds and different sexualities. It is something the games industry has been criticised for lacking in the past - especially in major releases like this.\nAshley says: \"I just think it's essential, representation in all media, we need it in every form. \n\"I think things are slowly starting to change.\n\"I would love to get to a point in entertainment where this isn't considered something risky.\"\nFor game director Neil Druckman, the decision wasn't made for the sake of it: \"We didn't say, 'Let's get diverse just to stand out'. It was more like an option to give us a richer story.\"\nNeil is also one of the bosses at the development studio Naughty Dog, and says they've been slowly trying to broaden the scope of the characters in their games for years.\n\"Some of the stuff we did with the first game, like even putting Ellie on the front of the box was a bit controversial. I don't think it should have been, but it was at the time.\n\"I think that's why we feel more confident to be able to draw all these different kinds of characters, with different backgrounds and identities to give us a diversity of storytelling. \n\"That doesn't automatically make the story better. But there's something magical when people see themselves in games, it broadens our audience and I think that's important.\"\nHowever, Neil is also aware that his studio is in a privileged position to be able to take risks: \"Naughty Dog has had a series of commercial successes, so it allows us to take chances.\n\"If The Last of Us Part 2 is successful, and someone wants to make a game with a similar cast, at least then marketing teams can look over and be like, 'Well that worked' so it won't be the thing that holds people back.\"\nThe lead up to the release has been a bumpy ride for the developer. \nFrom delays due to the coronavirus pandemic, to story leaks and criticisms of violent trailers.\nIt is a bleak world that Ellie and Joel inhabit and some reviews of the game have questioned the level of violence.\nNeil isn't flustered when considering criticisms of his game, saying: \"I think if we're telling this story in a different medium then the body count wouldn't be as high. \n\"It needs to be as high because we have to train you with mechanics of how the game plays. \n\"What we're going for, is that how it feels is more important than what the body count would be in real life. \n\"Ellie could not take on this many people, we know that, but we're after a certain kind of adrenaline and tension.\n\"I don't know how we could have created that with just a handful of people for you to come up against, that doesn't mean it's not possible and I'd love to see it. \n\"But we think the feeling of authenticity is more important than the actual one-to-one realism.\"\nThe game is releasing at a time of major discussions across the world about racial and gender equality. \nNeil says this game reflects that: \"It's very much based on real world conflict and tribalism.\n\"Things that we now unfortunately see very clear examples of in the US. \n\"But they're not new. They've been with us for the entire history of our species, and they probably will be going forward. \n\"I'd love for more games to explore this kind of stuff.\"\nAs for Ashley - an actor who spends lots of time working in games - she hopes things will keep changing: \"It feels like the industry grew up\".\n\"We've learned things and we need to start telling stories that include everyone. \n\"When you see that and play it, you'll see how important that is.\"\nFollow Newsbeat on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter and YouTube.\nListen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 weekdays - or listen back here.",

        "title": "Amazon v EU: Has the online giant met its match?",
        "description": "Covid-19 has not been a harbinger of doom for Amazon, unlike the case with many other firms.\nIts share price has actually increased since March - hitting a record high last week.\nIt turns out online retail isn't a bad space to be in when all the shops are shut. Jeff Bezos' mantle as the richest man on the planet seems safe, for now. \nBut around the world, governments are looking at Amazon and asking whether the tech giant is - well - too big. \nDoes it use its dominant position unfairly?\nThe EU now looks set to charge Amazon for anti-competitive behaviour. This could cost Amazon a lot of money and could alter the shopping experience it offers customers.\nCentral to the EU's concerns is Amazon's dual role. \nIt runs an online store and also sells its own products on that platform. The criticism is, that it's both the player and the referee.\nSpeaking to the BBC last year, the EU's competition enforcer Margrethe Vestager said: \"We never accept in a football match that one team was also judging the game\". \nMuch of the EU's concerns are thought to centre around the data that Amazon has access to and how it uses it. It can see sensitive commercial information on third-party products - like volume and price. \nThe big question is - is the company using that data to give Amazon's own products an unfair advantage?\nFor example, The Wall Street Journal has reported that Amazon accessed third-party seller data to develop its own products. \nIn other words, Amazon understands what sells well on its platform - and can then simply replicate what sells best.\nThere are other accusations too. \nIf you buy a product on Amazon, you'll get other similar products suggested to you in a pop-up called a 'Buy Box'. \nIf you're in the business of selling stuff, having your product on Amazon's Buy Box is - to put it mildly - a good thing. \nBut does Amazon unfairly promote its own products at the expense of third parties? The EU is sniffing around this area. \nThe general defence is that there are plenty of companies that act as both a shop and supplier. Tesco and Sainsbury's both sell their own labelled products in their stores, for example.\nThey also argue that - far from being anti-competitive - private-label products are good for customers and offer more choice. \nAmazon told the BBC: \"We strictly prohibit our employees from using non-public, seller-specific data to determine which private label products to launch\".\nThe company also wanted to point out that it already publishes data on how well some products sell online (just go to the 'Movers and Shakers' section of the website).\nCritics of Amazon believe this is a moment that will set the boundaries of what is legally acceptable in the online market place. \nBut it's still not totally clear - even if Amazon were to be fined - how this would affect Amazon's business mode or shopping online more generally. \nAugustin Reyna, from the European Consumer Organisation, told the BBC: \"The question is more, in the medium-to-long term, if Amazon were allowed to continue with these practices, consolidating its market position, it would be able to restrict choice and push up prices.\"\nA charge sheet could be published as soon as this week. \nHowever, the EU Commission is tight-lipped - it will currently only say that the investigation is \"ongoing\". \nIn theory Amazon could be fined 10% of its global revenue if found guilty of breaching competition law - about £15bn ($19bn). \nEven for Amazon that would be an eye-watering sum. \nBut don't expect this to happen overnight. It's unlikely we'll get a ruling until next year at the earliest. And even if Amazon is fined, it can - and almost certainly would - appeal. \nWell, no. Other countries have taken an interest in the EU's muscular approach to big tech. \nIn 2017 for example, the EU fined Google £2.1 billion for allegedly burying Google searches for rivals. \nRather than being enamoured, seduced even by the tech titans, the EU has been distinctly unimpressed with some of their behaviour.\nAnd this is rubbing off. Over the weekend it was reported that officials in California and Washington are also reviewing Amazon's business practices with respect to third-party sellers. \nA string of other anti-competition investigations are also being carried out in the US looking at Amazon and the other big tech firms, like Facebook and Google.

        "title": "How Elon Musk aims to revolutionise battery technology",
        "description": "Elon Musk has perhaps the most exciting portfolio of businesses on the planet.  \nThere's SpaceX with its mission to Mars, and Tesla with its super-fast hi-tech electric cars.  \nHe claims his Hyperloop concept could revolutionise public transport. And even his Boring Company is kind of interesting - it aims to find new ways to dig tunnels.\nSo which one will end up changing the world most? It is my contention that it will be his battery business.\nDoesn't sound that scintillating does it?\nBut the compact, lightweight lithium batteries that mean you can now stream movies on wafer-thin phones will soon be powering much more of your life.\nYou're probably already interested in the potential of electric cars.\nBut maybe you also have the usual concerns about actually buying one:  the price, the range, and worries about where you are going to charge the thing and how long you'll be stuck there.\nYet the market certainly seems to reckon they are the future. Just look at the Tesla share price.  \nLast week it briefly nudged ahead of Toyota to become the world's most valuable car firm, even though the Japanese giant sold 30 times as many vehicles last year.\nOne reason is that Elon Musk has been teasing investors and rivals with the promise of \"battery day\" some time soon, at which he will announce a series of advancements in battery tech.\nAnd cars are not the only vast new battery market.\nYou might have seen a story I wrote about how the world is slowly weaning itself off coal.\nWell, gigantic batteries connected to our electricity grids are going to be central to the great renewable energy revolution too. \n\"We are entering into a nearly exponential growth phase\", says Prof Paul Shearing. He's an expert on emerging battery technologies at University College London. \nHe expects electric vehicles alone to drive European battery demand up by a factor of 10 this decade. \nBut this explosion in demand will only be possible if we can make batteries cheaper, more durable and more efficient.\nThat is a big ask for any technology but fear not, Mr Musk's proposed \"battery day\" comes thanks to a whole cascade of breakthroughs.\nThe first of these was announced just last week when the Chinese battery-maker that supplies most of the major car makers, including Tesla, revealed it had produced the first \"million mile battery\". \nContemporary Amperex Technology (CATL) says its new battery is capable of powering a vehicle for more than a million miles (1.2 million, to be precise - or 1.9 million km) over a 16-year lifespan.\nMost car batteries offer warranties for 60,000-150,000 miles over a three to eight-year period.\nThis is a huge improvement in battery life, but will cost just 10% more than existing products, says CATL chair, Zeng Yuqun.\nHaving a battery you never need to change is obviously good news for the electric car industry. But longer-lasting batteries are also essential for what's known as \"stationary\" storage too.\nThese are the batteries we can attach to wind turbines or solar panels so renewable energy is available when the sun isn't shining or the wind isn't blowing.\nFairly soon you might even want a stationary battery in your home to store cheap off-peak electricity, or to collect the power your own solar panels generate. \nThe next barrier that is likely to be broken is price.\nThe landmark challenge in the electric vehicle industry is to get a battery costing under $100 (£78) per kilowatt hour.\n\"At that point you start to get electric vehicles that are cheaper than the equivalent internal combustion vehicles,\" says Seth Weintraub, a US battery technology journalist.\nOnce that happens the internal combustion engine will be effectively dead., he says, comparing it to how digital killed off film cameras a decade ago.\n\"In car dealerships we're going to go from one electric vehicle in the back lot somewhere, to one gas vehicle in the back lot somewhere.\"  \nSo when will this crucial price-point be passed?\nHe believes it already has.  \nMr Weintraub says his sources tell him these batteries are going into Teslas right now, and thinks this will be one of Mr Musk's \"battery day\" revelations.\nCheaper batteries will address some of the other key concerns potential customers have.\nThat is because it will make it economical to put bigger batteries into cars.\nThat has two major advantages.\nFirst, it means they can go much further on a single charge, so you'll soon be able to buy cars with ranges of 400-500 miles (640-800km) or more.\nSecond, big batteries charge faster for the bulk of their capacity, so you might be able to get up to 300 miles of range with just 10 minutes of charging.\nThat's comparable to the time it takes to fill a car with petrol or diesel. \nSo expect Elon Musk to announce upgrades for the Model S and X which will combine 400-500 mile range with supercar performance, says Mr Weintraub.\nSo, where are we going to make all these wonderful new batteries?\nAgain, we are expecting some major announcements from Mr Musk. Earlier this month his private jet reportedly landed at Luton airport.\nThe man, who actor Robert Downey Jr used as inspiration for Marvel's Tony Stark in the 2008 film Iron Man, is believed to have been flown by helicopter to a 650-acre site just outside Bristol.\nThe location is reckoned to be the prime UK candidate for one of Tesla's \"Gigafactories\", the huge battery plants it's pioneering.\nAnd he is planning an even bigger factory in the US, probably in Austin, Texas.\nAccording to Seth Weintraub this one will be a \"Terafactory\".\nThat's quite an upgrade.  \nGigafactories were so called because they would produce batteries that could store billions of watt-hours of power.\nBy that reasoning a terafactory should be able to make batteries with a total capacity in the trillions of watt-hours.\nAnd the logic of Mr Musk's ever-expanding factories remains the same. The bigger the scale, the easier it will be to deliver cost-slashing innovations, he believes.\nSo where are all the battery chemicals going to come from?\nTesla's Chinese partner CATL has found a way to make batteries free of cobalt, at least for shorter-range vehicles.\nCobalt is expensive and a lot is sourced from DR Congo, where it has been associated with child labour.  \nThere are no plans to get rid of the key ingredient in lightweight batteries, lithium.\nThere are large supplies in salt deposits around the world, including the biggest single reserve - as yet unexploited - in the hauntingly beautiful Salar de Uyuni salt plain in the remote Bolivian Andes.\nThe problem is the current method of separating out the lithium in these deposits is slow and inefficient. \nThe biggest salt lake currently being mined is the Salar de Atacama in Chile.  And at their significantly lower altitude, the Chileans can use natural evaporation to crystallise the salts, driven by the intense sunshine of the Atacama Desert.\nDespite these advantages, the process still takes months, and only recovers about 30% of the available lithium.  \nWhich is where a wannabe Elon Musk-style tycoon with a similarly exotic name comes in.\nTeague Egan is working with scientists on what he says is a \"nanoparticle\" filter that can separate lithium from other salts in solution, and will recover more like 90% of the lithium.\nInstead of months, he reckons it could eventually take just a few days.\nMr Egan says his firm EnergyX is already talking to key players about applying the technology on a commercial scale.\nIf effective it could dramatically cut the cost of lithium - removing one of the biggest bottlenecks to the ramping up of battery production..\nWhich brings us back to my original premise - that batteries will be the most transformative part of Elon Musk's empire. \nMr Musk's ambition is to create the iPhone of cars - a must-buy product that revolutionises our driving experience, while also delivering him a big fat profit. \nThat's what will make us ditch our old diesel and petrol cars. \nBut there is also something much bigger at stake: climate change. \nIf cheaper, better batteries enable a rapid switch to electric vehicles, and give us renewable energy whatever the weather, then clearly they are going to be central to efforts to decarbonise our economy.  \nAstronauts blasting off into space are a lot more exciting than a grey box with a couple of wires attached. \nBut if that grey box helps us jettison fossil fuels, then the grey box wins in terms of its power to change our world. \nOf course, you may disagree. And if you do, then please tell me why. @BBCJustinR",

        "title": "Son repeats father's historic ocean dive",
        "description": "It used to be said that more people had walked on the surface of the Moon than had dived to the deepest part of Earth's oceans. Not anymore.\nKelly Walsh, the son of the great ocean explorer Don Walsh, has just descended to the bottom of the Mariana Trench, almost 11km down in the Pacific. \nHe made the dive 60 years after his father created history in doing so.\nIt means Kelly is the 12th person to visit the trench floor - the same as the number of Apollo moonwalkers.\nThe 12-hour dive on Saturday saw him reach a depth of approximately 10,925m.\nKelly described it as \"a hugely emotional journey\" after returning to the surface.\nThe descent was piloted by the financier and adventurer Victor Vescovo. The Texan is conducting a series of dives into the lowest point of the Mariana Trench known as the Challenger Deep. \nMr Vescovo has acquired a support ship and human-rated submersible that he is using to survey several of the most extreme places on the ocean floor.\nRecent passengers who've gone down with him to the Challenger Deep include the first women to make the journey - the former Nasa astronaut Kathy Sullivan and the British-American mountaineer Vanessa O'Brien.\nBut Kelly Walsh's descent is particularly noteworthy because of his father, Don. On 23 January, 1960, the then US Navy officer, accompanied by Swiss national Jacques Piccard, made the first crewed dive to the floor of Earth's deepest ocean trench using the bathyscaphe Trieste.\nIt was an astonishing achievement given the precarious nature of the expedition. The trench is so deep, it would be possible to fit Mount Everest (8,848m) inside it and still have more than 2km of water above the peak. The pressure at the trench floor is crushing - some 100 million pascals, almost 16,000 pounds per square inch.\nSixty years on, modern technology means Victor Vescovo can reliably make very safe, repeat dives, so much so that he himself has now been down seven times in his submersible, the 12-tonne Deep Sea Vehicle (DSV) Limiting Factor.\nOn Saturday, Vescovo and Walsh spent fours hours at the bottom of what's called the \"western pool\" - one of three distinct zones in the Challenger Deep. It's the same pool that Don Walsh and Piccard visited, and the latest dive marked the first time anyone had been back since.\nThe Scottish marine biologist Alan Jamieson is one of the 12 who've made the dive to the bottom of the Mariana Trench. He went with Mr Vescovo to a slightly shallower (10,700m) location just to the east of Challenger Deep known as the Sirena Deep.\nOf Kelly Walsh's dive, he said: \"It's a commemoration of what his father did. It's also a kind of demonstration that we haven't lost that capability. People often ask why we don't seem able at the moment to go to the Moon having done it in the 60s and 70s.

        "title": "Sport heading for a fall as temperatures rise",
        "description": "Global sport faces major disruption from climate change in coming decades, according to a new analysis.\nBy 2050, it's estimated that almost one in four English football league grounds can expect flooding every year. \nBut tennis, rugby, athletics and winter sports will also face serious challenges from the impacts of rising temperatures, the author says. \nThe study finds that sports leaders are, in the main, failing to address the issue seriously.\nWhile the Covid-19 pandemic has disrupted sports as much as any other aspect of social life, many experts believe that this is just a dress rehearsal for the long-term impacts on sport of a world that's way too hot.\nExtreme weather events, related to rising temperatures, have already disrupted some of the world's most high-profile sports in recent years. \nA typhoon, which wreaked havoc in Japan last year, also affected fixtures at the Rugby Union World being held there. \nSmoke from bush fires stopped play at the Australian Tennis Open at the start of this year. \nThese and many other instances are a foretaste of the future, according to this new study compiled by academic and author David Goldblatt.\nAs football slowly recovers from the coronavirus crisis, his analysis shows that 23 of 92 English football league clubs will face partial or total annual flooding of their stadiums by 2050.\nIn the current Premier League, the home grounds of Southampton, Norwich, Chelsea and West Ham face a similar threat.\nCricket faces huge challenges globally as temperatures rise in places like India, Australia and the West Indies.\nVenues in Adelaide and Perth will see a 60% increase in days with temperatures over 40C over the next decade. \nIn golf, one in three British Open courses will be damaged by rising sea-levels, the report says. \nWinter sports also face an uncertain future. \nResearchers say that of the 19 venues that have already hosted the Winter Olympics, just 10 will be able to hold them by 2050.\nBut as well as showing the likely impacts of climate change on sports, the new study also looks at the contribution that the sporting industry makes to carbon emissions. \nThe author says that the scale of CO2 is equivalent to a country like Bolivia at the low end but as large as a country like Spain on the high end.\nThe estimations are likely an underestimate as they exclude the global sportswear and sports broadcasting industries, who have impacts on carbon that are difficult to calculate.\nWhatever the size of its carbon footprint, the cultural significance of sport gives it a tremendous platform to effect change, says the author. \n\"Sport may be just big enough to register, in terms of carbon emissions, as a small nation state, or a single megacity, but its own efforts are just a fraction of a percentage point of the world total,\" said David Goldblatt.\n\"Making a carbon zero world the common sense priority of the sports world would make a huge contribution to making it the common sense priority of all politics,\" he said.\nWhile some organisations including the International Olympic Committee and FIFA have signed up to a UN action plan to make sport carbon neutral by 2050, the majority of sports authorities have not. \nThe International Cricket Council is one of those who have not signed up. \nAmong winter sports, only the ice hockey and skiing federations have joined, \"which makes one wonder what the people in charge of luge and bobsleigh think they are going to be sliding on in the future,\" the report waspishly notes. \nThe report was commissioned by the Rapid Transition Alliance, a international group of academics and campaigners who argue for a faster response to climate change. \n\"A first step would be to bring an end to sponsorship from fossil fuel companies and products promoting fossil fuel intensive lifestyles,\" said Andrew Simms from the group.\n\"If players also speak out and say they believe clean air and a stable climate matter, millions more will see the possibilities for change.  It will not only send a message of hope for the wider world, but it will help to guarantee a planet that is safe for sport.\"\nFollow Matt on Twitter @mattmcgrathbbc.",

        "title": "Breathtaking new map of the X-ray Universe",
        "description": "Behold the hot, energetic Universe.\nA German-Russian space telescope has just acquired a breakthrough map of the sky that traces the heavens in X-rays.\nThe image records a lot of the violent action in the cosmos -  instances where matter is being accelerated, heated and shredded.\nFeasting black holes, exploding stars, and searingly hot gas.\nThe data comes from the eRosita instrument mounted on Spektr-RG.\nThis orbiting telescope was launched in July last year and despatched to an observing position some 1.5 million km from Earth. Once commissioned and declared fully operational in December, it was left to slowly rotate and scan the depths of space.\neRosita's first all-sky data-set, represented in the image at the top of this page, was completed only last week. It records over a million sources of X-rays.\n\"That's actually pretty much the same number as had been detected in the whole history of X-ray astronomy going back 60 years. We've basically doubled the known sources in just six months,\" said Kirpal Nandra, who heads the high-energy astrophysics group at the Max Planck Institute for Extraterrestrial Physics (MPE) in Garching, Germany.\n\"The data is truly stunning and I think what we're doing here will revolutionise X-ray astronomy,\" he told BBC News.\nThe map uses the so-called Aitoff projection, which unwraps the sphere of the sky on to an ellipse. The band across the middle is the plane of our Milky Way Galaxy, with the centre of the galaxy in the middle of the ellipse.\nThe image has been encoded with colour to help describe what's going on. Blues represent higher energy X-rays (1-2.3 kiloelectron volts, keV); greens are mid-range (0.6-1 keV); and reds are lower energy (0.3-0.6 keV).\nMuch of the galaxy's plane is dominated by highly energetic sources. In part, that's because copious amounts of gas and dust have absorbed and filtered out the lower energy radiation. Sources include stars with strong, magnetically active and extremely hot atmospheres.\nThe greens and yellows that draw a kind of mushroom feature covering a great swathe of the map represent hot gas inside and just outside our galaxy. This material imprints information about the formation and evolution of the Milky Way.\nSome of the bigger splodges are well known actors on the sky. The bright yellow patch just above the plane on the far right is a concentration of supernova remnants - the wreckage of stars that have exploded and whose shockwaves have super-heated a surrounding cocoon of dust and gas. This particular patch is dominated by the Vela supernova remnant. This was an explosion that happened thousands of years ago but a mere 800 light-years from Earth.   \nLook next at the diffuse red glow at the top and bottom of the map. This is largely X-ray emission from hot gas well beyond our galaxy. And in the white speckles, we are seeing principally the signature of super-massive black holes. Indeed, about 80% of all the sources contained in the new map are the gargantuan black holes that reside at the centres of distant galaxies. They pump out X-rays as their immense gravitational pull draws in and eviscerates matter.\nSome of the super-massive black holes making an appearance in the map are seen when the Universe was younger than one billion years old, less than 10% of its present age.\nSpektr-RG and its eRosita instrument intend to gather seven more all-sky surveys over the next 3.5 years. This will enable the telescope to refine its data, to remove artefacts and noise, but also to sense deeper into the cosmos and pick up the faint sources that would otherwise be beyond detection.\nOne key goal is to map the distribution of the hot, X-ray-emitting gas that illuminates the great clusters of galaxies.\nAstronomers hope this information can lead them to some fresh insights on how the Universe is structured and how it has changed through time. It's possible there may be some clues in this project about the nature of dark energy, the mysterious \"force\" that appears to be pushing the cosmos apart at an ever accelerating rate.\n\"That's the big prize, but it would only come at the end of the mission,\" explained Prof Nandra. \n\"Eight surveys allows us to go really deep into the distant Universe. Basically, we're trying to detect all of the clusters of galaxies in the Universe above a certain mass limit. We've got a nice sample already - maybe around 10,000. But we're hoping to get at least 100,000 clusters of galaxies.\"\neRosita is the German element on Spektr-RG. It takes up most of the room on the spacecraft bus, or chassis. But it sits next to a Russian instrument known as ART-XC, which is sensitive to higher energies, up to 30 keV.\nBoth eRosita and ART-XC use a cluster of seven tubular mirror modules to corral X-ray light down on to their sensitive camera detectors.\nJonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter: @BBCAmos",

        "title": "Urban dwellers yearn for the 'Good Life'",
        "description": "Land set aside for allotments in the UK has declined by 65% from a peak in the \"dig for victory\" and post-war era.\nScientists estimated that the lost allotments could have provided 6% of the population with their \"five-a-day\" fruit and veg diet.\nThe most deprived areas suffered the worst decline, experiencing eight times the level of allotment closures compared with the most affluent areas.\nThe study's findings appear in the Landscape and Urban Planning journal.\n\"We found that, overall, there had been a 65% decline in the total area of allotment land from its peak (1950s) to 2016,\" explained co-author Miriam Dobson from the University of Sheffield. \n\"In terms of the amount of the amount of food production capacity lost, the closed allotment land could have fed 6% of the population on their 'five-a-day' diet.\"\nThe researchers decided to assess the volume of land set aside for allotments because although it was widely assumed  that there had been a decline since the peak during the \"dig for victory\" and post-war years, there was no data available. \nThe team also wanted to understand if any of the former allotments could be reinstated as allotments to meet the renewed demand for allotments. \nThey said that the waiting list for an allotment plot was an estimated 100,000 people in 2013.\nTo gather the data it needed, the study looked at 10 geographically distributed cities across the UK, using historical Ordnance Survey maps of the 20th Century. It was then possible to plot the land used as allotments and monitor land-use change over the decades.\nMs Dobson, a PhD student at the university's Department of Animal and Plant Sciences, said there were a number of factors behind the reduction of allotment plots.\n\"There was reduced demand after the 1950s as people relied more on supermarkets and convenience stores,\" she told BBC News. \n\"There was also a loss in leisure time, which meant people did not have the time to attend to their allotment plots, and a loss of food growing knowledge created barriers to entry.\n\"As well as this, as the urban population was growing, urban land became increasingly valuable to developers.\"\nYet regarding the allotment sites that had been closed, the team found that about a quarter of the land had not been developed for buildings but had been used as another form of green space. \n \"If the land within this was potentially suitable for reconversion to allotments was changed back to food production, the space available could meet up to 100% of the waiting list demand in the cities,\" observed Ms Dobson. \nIn recent years, the demand for allotment plots has seen a renaissance, which many younger people wanted to grow their own fruit and veg, rather than it being seen as the preserve of pensioners.\nDuring the Covid-19 lockdown, people with allotments have been spending a lot of their time on their plots, growing plenty of fresh fruit and veg - which, at times, have been challenging to source in supermarkets.\nMs Dobson observed: \"We have already seen a huge increase in the number of people interested in growing their own food as a result of coronavirus, with garden centres and online shops selling out of seeds in the first weeks of lockdown.\n\"Coronavirus has… highlighted to people the fragility inherent within our globalised food system. In a time of crisis, interest in self-sufficiency rises.\nShe added that she felt there would likely be a surge in demand for allotment following this pandemic.\nThe team felt their study showed the importance of making sure that urban food production, such as allotments, were protected from being shut down, as well as highlighting the potential to expand such sites in towns and cities to meet demand.",

        "title": "New evidence of virus risks from wildlife trade",
        "description": "Rats sold in the markets and restaurants of Southeast Asia harbour multiple coronaviruses, a study shows.\nThe proportion of positives increased as live animals were moved from \"field to fork\", suggesting they were picking up viruses in the process.\nThe strains detected are different from Covid-19 and are not thought to be dangerous to human health.\nBut scientists have long warned that the wildlife trade can be an incubator for disease.\nThe mixing of multiple coronaviruses, and their apparent amplification along the supply chain into restaurants, suggests \"maximal risk for end consumers\", said a team of researchers from the US and Vietnam.\nThe origins of the current pandemic are thought to lie in the wildlife trade, with the disease emerging in bats and jumping to people via another, as yet unidentified, species.\nThe new findings, regarded as preliminary, relate to rats, but may apply to other wildlife, such as civets and pangolins, which are also collected, transported and confined in large numbers.\n\"While these aren't dangerous viruses they offer information on how viruses can be amplified under these conditions,\" said Sarah Olson of New York-based conservation group, WCS, which led the study alongside experts in Vietnam.\nCo-researcher, Amanda Fine, also of WCS, added: \"Wildlife supply chains, and the conditions the animals experience while in the supply chain, appear to greatly amplify the prevalence of coronaviruses.\"\nRats are a common food source in Vietnam, where they are captured in rice fields and transported to markets and restaurants, to be butchered as a fresh source of meat. The rodents are also raised in wildlife farms, along with other animals such as porcupines.\nSix known coronaviruses were detected in samples taken at 70 sites in Vietnam in 2013 and 2014. High proportions of positive samples were found in field rats destined for human consumption. The proportion of positives significantly increased along the supply chain:\nDetection rates in rodent populations in their \"natural\" habitat are closer to 0-2%, said the researchers.\nThe study was carried out with animal health experts in Vietnam, which is considering a ban on wildlife trade and consumption. It appears in the pre-print journal bioRxiv in advance of peer-review.\nConservation experts say the coronavirus pandemic is a watershed moment for curbing the global wildlife trade. Wet markets can be \"time bombs\" for epidemics, they warn, bringing together different species which can shed and spread virus.\nChina banned the farming and consumption of live wildlife in the wake of the outbreak, however loopholes remain, such as the trade in wild animals for medicine, pets and scientific research. \nChina has moved to remove pangolins from the official list of traditional Chinese medicine treatments. The scales are highly coveted by traditional Chinese medicine practitioners, while pangolin meat is seen as a delicacy. \nFollow Helen on Twitter.",

        "title": "One-fifth of Earth's ocean floor is now mapped",
        "description": "We've just become a little less ignorant about Planet Earth.\nThe initiative that seeks to galvanise the creation of a full map of the ocean floor says one-fifth of this task has now been completed.\nWhen the Nippon Foundation-GEBCO Seabed 2030 Project was launched in 2016, only 6% of the global ocean bottom had been surveyed to what might be called modern standards.\nThat number now stands at 19%, up from 16% in just the last year.\nSome 14.5 million sq km of new bathymetric (depth) data was included in the GEBCO grid in 2019 - an area equivalent to almost twice that of Australia.\nIt does, however, still leave a great swathe of the planet unmapped to an acceptable degree.\n\"Today we stand at the 19% level. That means we've got another 81% of the oceans still to survey, still to map. That's an area about twice the size of Mars that we have to capture in the next decade,\" project director Jamie McMichael-Phillips told BBC News.\nThe map at the top of this page illustrates the challenge faced by GEBCO in the coming years. \nBlack represents those areas where we have yet to get direct echosounding measurements of the shape of the ocean floor. Blues correspond to water depth (deeper is purple, shallower is lighter blue). \nIt's not true to say we have no idea of what's in the black zones; satellites have actually taught us a great deal. Certain spacecraft carry altimeter instruments that can infer seafloor topography from the way its gravity sculpts the water surface above - but this only gives a best resolution at over a kilometre, and Seabed 2030 has a desire for a resolution of at least 100m everywhere.\nBetter seafloor maps are needed for a host of reasons.\nThey are essential for navigation, of course, and for laying underwater cables and pipelines.\nThey are also important for fisheries management and conservation, because it is around the underwater mountains that wildlife tends to congregate. Each seamount is a biodiversity hotspot.\nIn addition, the rugged seafloor influences the behaviour of ocean currents and the vertical mixing of water.\nThis is information required to improve the models that forecast future climate change - because it is the oceans that play a critical role in moving heat around the planet. And if you want to understand precisely how sea-levels will rise in different parts  of the world, good ocean-floor maps are a must.\nMuch of the data that's been imported into the GEBCO grid recently has been in existence for some time but was \"sitting on a shelf\" out of the public domain. The companies, institutions and governments that were holding this information have now handed it over - and there is probably a lot more of this hidden resource still to be released.\nBut new acquisitions will also be required. Some of these will come from a great crowdsourcing effort - from ships, big and small, routinely operating their echo-sounding equipment as they transit the globe. Even small vessels - fishing boats and yachts - can play their part by attaching data-loggers to their sonar and navigation equipment. \nOne very effective strategy is evidenced by the British Antarctic Survey (BAS), which operates in the more remote parts of the globe - and that is simply to mix up the routes taken by ships.\n\"Very early on we adopted the ethos that data should be collected on passage - on the way to where we were going, not just at the site of interest,\" explained BAS scientist Dr Rob Larter. \n\"A beautiful example of this is the recent bathymetric map of the Drake Passage area (between South America and Antarctica). A lot of that was acquired by different research projects as they fanned out and moved back and forth to the places they were going.\"\nNew technology will be absolutely central to the GEBCO quest. \nOcean Infinity, a prominent UK-US company that conducts seafloor surveys, is currently building a fleet of robotic surface vessels through a subsidiary it calls Armada. This start-up's MD, Dan Hook, says low-cost, uncrewed vehicles may be the only way to close some of the gaps in the more out-of-the-way locations in the 2030 grid.\nHe told BBC News: \"When you look at the the mapping of the seabed in areas closer to shore, you see the business case very quickly. Whether it's for wind farms or cable-laying - there are lots of people that want to know what's down there. But when it's those very remote areas of the planet, the case then is really only a scientific one.\"    \nJamie McMichael-Phillips is confident his project's target can be met if everyone pulls together.\n\"I am confident, but to do it we will need partnerships. We need governments, we need industry, we need academics, we need philanthropists, and we need citizen scientists. We need all these individuals to come together if we're to deliver an ocean map that is absolutely fundamental and essential to humankind.\"\nGEBCO stands for General Bathymetric Chart of the Oceans. It is the only intergovernmental organisation with a mandate to map the entire ocean floor. The latest status of its Seabed 2030 project was announced to coincide with World Hydrography Day.\nJonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter: @BBCAmos",

        "title": "Son repeats father's historic ocean dive",
        "description": "It used to be said that more people had walked on the surface of the Moon than had dived to the deepest part of Earth's oceans. Not anymore.\nKelly Walsh, the son of the great ocean explorer Don Walsh, has just descended to the bottom of the Mariana Trench, almost 11km down in the Pacific. \nHe made the dive 60 years after his father created history in doing so.\nIt means Kelly is the 12th person to visit the trench floor - the same as the number of Apollo moonwalkers.\nThe 12-hour dive on Saturday saw him reach a depth of approximately 10,925m.\nKelly described it as \"a hugely emotional journey\" after returning to the surface.\nThe descent was piloted by the financier and adventurer Victor Vescovo. The Texan is conducting a series of dives into the lowest point of the Mariana Trench known as the Challenger Deep. \nMr Vescovo has acquired a support ship and human-rated submersible that he is using to survey several of the most extreme places on the ocean floor.\nRecent passengers who've gone down with him to the Challenger Deep include the first women to make the journey - the former Nasa astronaut Kathy Sullivan and the British-American mountaineer Vanessa O'Brien.\nBut Kelly Walsh's descent is particularly noteworthy because of his father, Don. On 23 January, 1960, the then US Navy officer, accompanied by Swiss national Jacques Piccard, made the first crewed dive to the floor of Earth's deepest ocean trench using the bathyscaphe Trieste.\nIt was an astonishing achievement given the precarious nature of the expedition. The trench is so deep, it would be possible to fit Mount Everest (8,848m) inside it and still have more than 2km of water above the peak. The pressure at the trench floor is crushing - some 100 million pascals, almost 16,000 pounds per square inch.\nSixty years on, modern technology means Victor Vescovo can reliably make very safe, repeat dives, so much so that he himself has now been down seven times in his submersible, the 12-tonne Deep Sea Vehicle (DSV) Limiting Factor.\nOn Saturday, Vescovo and Walsh spent fours hours at the bottom of what's called the \"western pool\" - one of three distinct zones in the Challenger Deep. It's the same pool that Don Walsh and Piccard visited, and the latest dive marked the first time anyone had been back since.\nThe Scottish marine biologist Alan Jamieson is one of the 12 who've made the dive to the bottom of the Mariana Trench. He went with Mr Vescovo to a slightly shallower (10,700m) location just to the east of Challenger Deep known as the Sirena Deep.\nOf Kelly Walsh's dive, he said: \"It's a commemoration of what his father did. It's also a kind of demonstration that we haven't lost that capability. People often ask why we don't seem able at the moment to go to the Moon having done it in the 60s and 70s. Likewise, with the deep ocean, Don Walsh went to the bottom of the Mariana Trench and then for several decades we didn't go anymore. But now we're showing we can do it again, and we're doing it loads.\"\nDr Jamieson is in the process of joining up with Mr Vescovo's expedition. There's a plan to take the DSV Limiting Factor shortly to the Philippine Trench, which in terms of depth at 10,500m is third only to the Mariana and Tonga trenches. \nBut it's a highly significant location in the history of ocean exploration, explained Dr Jon Copley from the University of Southampton.\nIt's where the Danish Galathea expedition in 1951 trawled animals from more than 10km down. It was the first proof that higher animals could live deeper than 10,000m, he told BBC News. \nVictor Vescovo's exploits can be followed on the website of Caladan Oceanic, which has organised the venture with Triton Submarines, who developed the Limiting Factor, and EYOS Expeditions.\nDr Copley keeps a history of ocean exploration on his blog.\nSource: Dr Jon Copley @expeditionlog\nJonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter: @BBCAmos",

        "description": "Global sport faces major disruption from climate change in coming decades, according to a new analysis.\nBy 2050, it's estimated that almost one in four English football league grounds can expect flooding every year. \nBut tennis, rugby, athletics and winter sports will also face serious challenges from the impacts of rising temperatures, the author says. \nThe study finds that sports leaders are, in the main, failing to address the issue seriously.\nWhile the Covid-19 pandemic has disrupted sports as much as any other aspect of social life, many experts believe that this is just a dress rehearsal for the long-term impacts on sport of a world that's way too hot.\nExtreme weather events, related to rising temperatures, have already disrupted some of the world's most high-profile sports in recent years. \nA typhoon, which wreaked havoc in Japan last year, also affected fixtures at the Rugby Union World being held there. \nSmoke from bush fires stopped play at the Australian Tennis Open at the start of this year. \nThese and many other instances are a foretaste of the future, according to this new study compiled by academic and author David Goldblatt.\nAs football slowly recovers from the coronavirus crisis, his analysis shows that 23 of 92 English football league clubs will face partial or total annual flooding of their stadiums by 2050.\nIn the current Premier League, the home grounds of Southampton, Norwich, Chelsea and West Ham face a similar threat.\nCricket faces huge challenges globally as temperatures rise in places like India, Australia and the West Indies.\nVenues in Adelaide and Perth will see a 60% increase in days with temperatures over 40C over the next decade. \nIn golf, one in three British Open courses will be damaged by rising sea-levels, the report says. \nWinter sports also face an uncertain future. \nResearchers say that of the 19 venues that have already hosted the Winter Olympics, just 10 will be able to hold them by 2050.\nBut as well as showing the likely impacts of climate change on sports, the new study also looks at the contribution that the sporting industry makes to carbon emissions. \nThe author says that the scale of CO2 is equivalent to a country like Bolivia at the low end but as large as a country like Spain on the high end.\nThe estimations are likely an underestimate as they exclude the global sportswear and sports broadcasting industries, who have impacts on carbon that are difficult to calculate.\nWhatever the size of its carbon footprint, the cultural significance of sport gives it a tremendous platform to effect change, says the author. \n\"Sport may be just big enough to register, in terms of carbon emissions, as a small nation state, or a single megacity, but its own efforts are just a fraction of a percentage point of the world total,\" said David Goldblatt.\n\"Making a carbon zero world the common sense priority of the sports world would make a huge contribution to making it the common sense priority of all politics,\" he said.\nWhile some organisations including the International Olympic Committee and FIFA have signed up to a UN action plan to make sport carbon neutral by 2050, the majority of sports authorities have not. \nThe International Cricket Council is one of those who have not signed up. \nAmong winter sports, only the ice hockey and skiing federations have joined, \"which makes one wonder what the people in charge of luge and bobsleigh think they are going to be sliding on in the future,\" the report waspishly notes. \nThe report was commissioned by the Rapid Transition Alliance, a international group of academics and campaigners who argue for a faster response to climate change. \n\"A first step would be to bring an end to sponsorship from fossil fuel companies and products promoting fossil fuel intensive lifestyles,\" said Andrew Simms from the group.\n\"If players also speak out and say they believe clean air and a stable climate matter, millions more will see the possibilities for change.

        "title": "Urban dwellers yearn for the 'Good Life'",
        "description": "Land set aside for allotments in the UK has declined by 65% from a peak in the \"dig for victory\" and post-war era.\nScientists estimated that the lost allotments could have provided 6% of the population with their \"five-a-day\" fruit and veg diet.\nThe most deprived areas suffered the worst decline, experiencing eight times the level of allotment closures compared with the most affluent areas.\nThe study's findings appear in the Landscape and Urban Planning journal.\n\"We found that, overall, there had been a 65% decline in the total area of allotment land from its peak (1950s) to 2016,\" explained co-author Miriam Dobson from the University of Sheffield. \n\"In terms of the amount of the amount of food production capacity lost, the closed allotment land could have fed 6% of the population on their 'five-a-day' diet.\"\nThe researchers decided to assess the volume of land set aside for allotments because although it was widely assumed  that there had been a decline since the peak during the \"dig for victory\" and post-war years, there was no data available. \nThe team also wanted to understand if any of the former allotments could be reinstated as allotments to meet the renewed demand for allotments. \nThey said that the waiting list for an allotment plot was an estimated 100,000 people in 2013.\nTo gather the data it needed, the study looked at 10 geographically distributed cities across the UK, using historical Ordnance Survey maps of the 20th Century. It was then possible to plot the land used as allotments and monitor land-use change over the decades.\nMs Dobson, a PhD student at the university's Department of Animal and Plant Sciences, said there were a number of factors behind the reduction of allotment plots.\n\"There was reduced demand after the 1950s as people relied more on supermarkets and convenience stores,\" she told BBC News. \n\"There was also a loss in leisure time, which meant people did not have the time to attend to their allotment plots, and a loss of food growing knowledge created barriers to entry.\n\"As well as this, as the urban population was growing, urban land became increasingly valuable to developers.\"\nYet regarding the allotment sites that had been closed, the team found that about a quarter of the land had not been developed for buildings but had been used as another form of green space. \n \"If the land within this was potentially suitable for reconversion to allotments was changed back to food production, the space available could meet up to 100% of the waiting list demand in the cities,\" observed Ms Dobson. \nIn recent years, the demand for allotment plots has seen a renaissance, which many younger people wanted to grow their own fruit and veg, rather than it being seen as the preserve of pensioners.\nDuring the Covid-19 lockdown, people with allotments have been spending a lot of their time on their plots, growing plenty of fresh fruit and veg - which, at times, have been challenging to source in supermarkets.\nMs Dobson observed: \"We have already seen a huge increase in the number of people interested in growing their own food as a result of coronavirus, with garden centres and online shops selling out of seeds in the first weeks of lockdown.\n\"Coronavirus has… highlighted to people the fragility inherent within our globalised food system. In a time of crisis, interest in self-sufficiency rises.\nShe added that she felt there would likely be a surge in demand for allotment following this pandemic.\nThe team felt their study showed the importance of making sure that urban food production, such as allotments, were protected from being shut down, as well as highlighting the potential to expand such sites in towns and cities to meet demand.",

        "title": "New evidence of virus risks from wildlife trade",
        "description": "Rats sold in the markets and restaurants of Southeast Asia harbour multiple coronaviruses, a study shows.\nThe proportion of positives increased as live animals were moved from \"field to fork\", suggesting they were picking up viruses in the process.\nThe strains detected are different from Covid-19 and are not thought to be dangerous to human health.\nBut scientists have long warned that the wildlife trade can be an incubator for disease.\nThe mixing of multiple coronaviruses, and their apparent amplification along the supply chain into restaurants, suggests \"maximal risk for end consumers\", said a team of researchers from the US and Vietnam.\nThe origins of the current pandemic are thought to lie in the wildlife trade, with the disease emerging in bats and jumping to people via another, as yet unidentified, species.\nThe new findings, regarded as preliminary, relate to rats, but may apply to other wildlife, such as civets and pangolins, which are also collected, transported and confined in large numbers.\n\"While these aren't dangerous viruses they offer information on how viruses can be amplified under these conditions,\" said Sarah Olson of New York-based conservation group, WCS, which led the study alongside experts in Vietnam.\nCo-researcher, Amanda Fine, also of WCS, added: \"Wildlife supply chains, and the conditions the animals experience while in the supply chain, appear to greatly amplify the prevalence of coronaviruses.\"\nRats are a common food source in Vietnam, where they are captured in rice fields and transported to markets and restaurants, to be butchered as a fresh source of meat. The rodents are also raised in wildlife farms, along with other animals such as porcupines.\nSix known coronaviruses were detected in samples taken at 70 sites in Vietnam in 2013 and 2014. High proportions of positive samples were found in field rats destined for human consumption. The proportion of positives significantly increased along the supply chain:\nDetection rates in rodent populations in their \"natural\" habitat are closer to 0-2%, said the researchers.\nThe study was carried out with animal health experts in Vietnam, which is considering a ban on wildlife trade and consumption. It appears in the pre-print journal bioRxiv in advance of peer-review.\nConservation experts say the coronavirus pandemic is a watershed moment for curbing the global wildlife trade. Wet markets can be \"time bombs\" for epidemics, they warn, bringing together different species which can shed and spread virus.\nChina banned the farming and consumption of live wildlife in the wake of the outbreak, however loopholes remain, such as the trade in wild animals for medicine, pets and scientific research. \nChina has moved to remove pangolins from the official list of traditional Chinese medicine treatments. The scales are highly coveted by traditional Chinese medicine practitioners, while pangolin meat is seen as a delicacy. \nFollow Helen on Twitter.",

        "title": "Son repeats father's historic ocean dive",
        "description": "It used to be said that more people had walked on the surface of the Moon than had dived to the deepest part of Earth's oceans. Not anymore.\nKelly Walsh, the son of the great ocean explorer Don Walsh, has just descended to the bottom of the Mariana Trench, almost 11km down in the Pacific. \nHe made the dive 60 years after his father created history in doing so.\nIt means Kelly is the 12th person to visit the trench floor - the same as the number of Apollo moonwalkers.\nThe 12-hour dive on Saturday saw him reach a depth of approximately 10,925m.\nKelly described it as \"a hugely emotional journey\" after returning to the surface.\nThe descent was piloted by the financier and adventurer Victor Vescovo. The Texan is conducting a series of dives into the lowest point of the Mariana Trench known as the Challenger Deep. \nMr Vescovo has acquired a support ship and human-rated submersible that he is using to survey several of the most extreme places on the ocean floor.\nRecent passengers who've gone down with him to the Challenger Deep include the first women to make the journey - the former Nasa astronaut Kathy Sullivan and the British-American mountaineer Vanessa O'Brien.\nBut Kelly Walsh's descent is particularly noteworthy because of his father, Don. On 23 January, 1960, the then US Navy officer, accompanied by Swiss national Jacques Piccard, made the first crewed dive to the floor of Earth's deepest ocean trench using the bathyscaphe Trieste.\nIt was an astonishing achievement given the precarious nature of the expedition. The trench is so deep, it would be possible to fit Mount Everest (8,848m) inside it and still have more than 2km of water above the peak. The pressure at the trench floor is crushing - some 100 million pascals, almost 16,000 pounds per square inch.\nSixty years on, modern technology means Victor Vescovo can reliably make very safe, repeat dives, so much so that he himself has now been down seven times in his submersible, the 12-tonne Deep Sea Vehicle (DSV) Limiting Factor.\nOn Saturday, Vescovo and Walsh spent fours hours at the bottom of what's called the \"western pool\" - one of three distinct zones in the Challenger Deep. It's the same pool that Don Walsh and Piccard visited, and the latest dive marked the first time anyone had been back since.\nThe Scottish marine biologist Alan Jamieson is one of the 12 who've made the dive to the bottom of the Mariana Trench. He went with Mr Vescovo to a slightly shallower (10,700m) location just to the east of Challenger Deep known as the Sirena Deep.\nOf Kelly Walsh's dive, he said: \"It's a commemoration of what his father did. It's also a kind of demonstration that we haven't lost that capability. People often ask why we don't seem able at the moment to go to the Moon having done it in the 60s and 70s. Likewise, with the deep ocean, Don Walsh went to the bottom of the Mariana Trench and then for several decades we didn't go anymore. But now we're showing we can do it again, and we're doing it loads.\"\nDr Jamieson is in the process of joining up with Mr Vescovo's expedition. There's a plan to take the DSV Limiting Factor shortly to the Philippine Trench, which in terms of depth at 10,500m is third only to the Mariana and Tonga trenches. \nBut it's a highly significant location in the history of ocean exploration, explained Dr Jon Copley from the University of Southampton.\nIt's where the Danish Galathea expedition in 1951 trawled animals from more than 10km down. It was the first proof that higher animals could live deeper than 10,000m, he told BBC News. \nVictor Vescovo's exploits can be followed on the website of Caladan Oceanic, which has organised the venture with Triton Submarines, who developed the Limiting Factor, and EYOS Expeditions.\nDr Copley keeps a history of ocean exploration on his blog.\nSource: Dr Jon Copley @expeditionlog\nJonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter: @BBCAmos",

        "title": "Urban dwellers yearn for the 'Good Life'",
        "description": "Land set aside for allotments in the UK has declined by 65% from a peak in the \"dig for victory\" and post-war era.\nScientists estimated that the lost allotments could have provided 6% of the population with their \"five-a-day\" fruit and veg diet.\nThe most deprived areas suffered the worst decline, experiencing eight times the level of allotment closures compared with the most affluent areas.\nThe study's findings appear in the Landscape and Urban Planning journal.\n\"We found that, overall, there had been a 65% decline in the total area of allotment land from its peak (1950s) to 2016,\" explained co-author Miriam Dobson from the University of Sheffield. \n\"In terms of the amount of the amount of food production capacity lost, the closed allotment land could have fed 6% of the population on their 'five-a-day' diet.\"\nThe researchers decided to assess the volume of land set aside for allotments because although it was widely assumed  that there had been a decline since the peak during the \"dig for victory\" and post-war years, there was no data available. \nThe team also wanted to understand if any of the former allotments could be reinstated as allotments to meet the renewed demand for allotments. \nThey said that the waiting list for an allotment plot was an estimated 100,000 people in 2013.\nTo gather the data it needed, the study looked at 10 geographically distributed cities across the UK, using historical Ordnance Survey maps of the 20th Century. It was then possible to plot the land used as allotments and monitor land-use change over the decades.\nMs Dobson, a PhD student at the university's Department of Animal and Plant Sciences, said there were a number of factors behind the reduction of allotment plots.\n\"There was reduced demand after the 1950s as people relied more on supermarkets and convenience stores,\" she told BBC News. \n\"There was also a loss in leisure time, which meant people did not have the time to attend to their allotment plots, and a loss of food growing knowledge created barriers to entry.\n\"As well as this, as the urban population was growing, urban land became increasingly valuable to developers.\"\nYet regarding the allotment sites that had been closed, the team found that about a quarter of the land had not been developed for buildings but had been used as another form of green space. \n \"If the land within this was potentially suitable for reconversion to allotments was changed back to food production, the space available could meet up to 100% of the waiting list demand in the cities,\" observed Ms Dobson. \nIn recent years, the demand for allotment plots has seen a renaissance, which many younger people wanted to grow their own fruit and veg, rather than it being seen as the preserve of pensioners.\nDuring the Covid-19 lockdown, people with allotments have been spending a lot of their time on their plots, growing plenty of fresh fruit and veg - which, at times, have been challenging to source in supermarkets.\nMs Dobson observed: \"We have already seen a huge increase in the number of people interested in growing their own food as a result of coronavirus, with garden centres and online shops selling out of seeds in the first weeks of lockdown.\n\"Coronavirus has… highlighted to people the fragility inherent within our globalised food system. In a time of crisis, interest in self-sufficiency rises.\nShe added that she felt there would likely be a surge in demand for allotment following this pandemic.\nThe team felt their study showed the importance of making sure that urban food production, such as allotments, were protected from being shut down, as well as highlighting the potential to expand such sites in towns and cities to meet demand.",

        "description": "Rats sold in the markets and restaurants of Southeast Asia harbour multiple coronaviruses, a study shows.\nThe proportion of positives increased as live animals were moved from \"field to fork\", suggesting they were picking up viruses in the process.\nThe strains detected are different from Covid-19 and are not thought to be dangerous to human health.\nBut scientists have long warned that the wildlife trade can be an incubator for disease.\nThe mixing of multiple coronaviruses, and their apparent amplification along the supply chain into restaurants, suggests \"maximal risk for end consumers\", said a team of researchers from the US and Vietnam.\nThe origins of the current pandemic are thought to lie in the wildlife trade, with the disease emerging in bats and jumping to people via another, as yet unidentified, species.\nThe new findings, regarded as preliminary, relate to rats, but may apply to other wildlife, such as civets and pangolins, which are also collected, transported and confined in large numbers.\n\"While these aren't dangerous viruses they offer information on how viruses can be amplified under these conditions,\" said Sarah Olson of New York-based conservation group, WCS, which led the study alongside experts in Vietnam.\nCo-researcher, Amanda Fine, also of WCS, added: \"Wildlife supply chains, and the conditions the animals experience while in the supply chain, appear to greatly amplify the prevalence of coronaviruses.\"\nRats are a common food source in Vietnam, where they are captured in rice fields and transported to markets and restaurants, to be butchered as a fresh source of meat. The rodents are also raised in wildlife farms, along with other animals such as porcupines.\nSix known coronaviruses were detected in samples taken at 70 sites in Vietnam in 2013 and 2014. High proportions of positive samples were found in field rats destined for human consumption. The proportion of positives significantly increased along the supply chain:\nDetection rates in rodent populations in their \"natural\" habitat are closer to 0-2%, said the researchers.\nThe study was carried out with animal health experts in Vietnam, which is considering a ban on wildlife trade and consumption. It appears in the pre-print journal bioRxiv in advance of peer-review.\nConservation experts say the coronavirus pandemic is a watershed moment for curbing the global wildlife trade. Wet markets can be \"time bombs\" for epidemics, they warn, bringing together different species which can shed and spread virus.\nChina banned the farming and consumption of live wildlife in the wake of the outbreak, however loopholes remain, such as the trade in wild animals for medicine, pets and scientific research. \nChina has moved to remove pangolins from the official list of traditional Chinese medicine treatments. The scales are highly coveted by traditional Chinese medicine practitioners, while pangolin meat is seen as a delicacy. \nFollow Helen on Twitter.",

        "title": "Garden villages 'locking-in car dependency'",
        "description": "England’s new garden villages and towns risk becoming car-dependent commuter estates, a report has warned.\nThe government promised the sites would be thriving communities - with jobs, shops and recreational facilities.\nBut research has suggested the garden villages may be little better than the reviled edge-of town estates they were supposed to supersede.\nThe government said the report was unfair because the settlements were still in their early stages.\nBut the researchers said they believed the 20 garden communities they assessed - still in various stages of the planning process - would create up to 200,000 households dependent on driving.\nThe report has come from Transport for New Homes, a group promoting alternatives to the car. \nIt has been supported by the RAC Foundation, which said most drivers did not want to need a car to visit the corner shop. \nThe garden village concept was devised to overcome problems of local resistance to housing estates bolted on to small towns.\nThe government's prospectus said these should be largely self-sustaining and genuinely mixed-use, with public transport, walking and cycling enabling access to jobs, education and services.\nBut the report found that:  \nOne author, Jenny Raggett, said: “Garden villages were put forward as an alternative to characterless estates – but they may well end up with more tarmac than garden.”\nShe said this was especially regrettable as the coronavirus outbreak had prompted more people to walk and cycle – a move that was being encouraged by the government.\nSteve Gooding, RAC Foundation director, said: \"The vision is laudable but is at grave risk of being missed. The reality looks set to ingrain car dependence.\n“Many of us will still wish to own and use our cars… but we don’t want to be forced to get behind the wheel for every trip we make.”\nThe report’s authors singled out Long Marston, a proposed 3,500-home Garden Village in Warwickshire. As a former airfield it was categorised as a “brownfield” site, which would help secure planning approval. \nThe developers’ prospectus said: “Long Marston Airfield will provide opportunities to live, work and socialise, all within 10 minutes of historic Stratford.\"\nThe report’s authors agreed the trip to Stratford was indeed 10 minutes – so long as you had a car. \nThey said there was no evidence the village would create employment, and they believed it would not be big enough to support a full range of facilities.\nMike Emett from Cala Homes told BBC News: \"It’s on a brownfield site in the countryside, so by definition it’s not near any town. \n“We are having a debate ourselves whether the settlement will be big enough to support higher facilities such as a secondary school”.\nA government spokesperson said: “Many of these settlements are in their early stages and we are continuing to work with local partners to get the right infrastructure in place.”\nHe said the majority of new garden communities on green field sites would have more than 40% of their area given over to green space accessible to all by foot and cycle.\nFollow Roger on Twitter.",

        "title": "BP plans for post-coronavirus low-carbon future",
        "description": "BP has forecast lower oil prices for decades to come as governments speed up plans to cut carbon emissions in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic. \nIt has cut price forecasts by about 30%, and expects Brent crude to average $55 a barrel from now until 2050.\nAs a result, the oil giant says it will revise down the value of its assets by between $13bn and $17.5bn (£13.8bn).\nBP said it would have to become a \"leaner, faster-moving and lower cost organisation\".\nLast week, the firm announced plans to cut 10,000 jobs following a global slump in demand for oil.\nCountries across the globe have ordered people to stay indoors and not travel as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, which has caused a slump in demand for oil. \nAs a result, the cost of oil fell to less than $20 a barrel at the peak of the crisis, less than a third of the $66 it cost at the start of the year. \nFor a brief period buyers were actually paid to take delivery of crude oil amid a shortage of storage.\nThe price has since partly recovered to around $37 a barrel.\nBP says it has \"a growing expectation that the aftermath of the pandemic will accelerate the pace of transition to a lower carbon economy and energy system, as countries seek to 'build back better' so that their economies will be more resilient in the future\".\nThe BBC's environment analyst, Roger Harrabin, said: \"The North Sea is difficult and expensive to exploit, so this is clearly a business-based decision by BP.\n\"But the ramifications for the climate are potentially very significant. Experts have been warning for years that firms have already discovered far more oil than we can afford to burn if we want to protect the climate.\n\"This, in part, is a reflection of that new reality. We'll see how other firms respond.\"\nWhen Bernard Looney took over as BP chief executive in February, there was much talk that he, finally, would reshape the company in line with the need to combat climate change. \nHis predecessors - going right back to John (now Lord) Browne had often spoken of it, but \"Beyond Petroleum\", Lord Browne's phrase for a new-look BP, had often been held back by financial imperatives - not least of which the tens of billions of pounds spent in compensation and clean-up payments after the tragic Gulf of Mexico blow out in 2010. \nThe coronavirus has now rather forced Mr Looney's hand. \nHe has already announced that 10,000 jobs will go worldwide in response to lower demand for oil, and this morning's statement is the first step in confronting what Mr Looney believes will be a harsh new reality for big oil. \nNot only will prices be lower for longer, but government efforts to rebuild the economy will mean a faster-than-expected shift to low-carbon sources of energy. \nThat means that the value of the oil in the ground that BP plans to develop is lower than forecast, and that some fields might never be developed. \nThis is a powerful echo - although it does not come from the same argument - of environmental campaigners' \"stranded assets\" thesis. \nThis says that oil companies will have oil fields that will not be able to be developed at all if we are to keep climate-change induced temperature increases in check.\nThe question now is whether other big oil companies, in particular the US giant Exxon, which has been resistant to climate-change arguments, will follow suit.",

        "title": "How Elon Musk aims to revolutionise battery technology",
        "description": "Elon Musk has perhaps the most exciting portfolio of businesses on the planet.  \nThere's SpaceX with its mission to Mars, and Tesla with its super-fast hi-tech electric cars.  \nHe claims his Hyperloop concept could revolutionise public transport. And even his Boring Company is kind of interesting - it aims to find new ways to dig tunnels.\nSo which one will end up changing the world most? It is my contention that it will be his battery business.\nDoesn't sound that scintillating does it?\nBut the compact, lightweight lithium batteries that mean you can now stream movies on wafer-thin phones will soon be powering much more of your life.\nYou're probably already interested in the potential of electric cars.\nBut maybe you also have the usual concerns about actually buying one:  the price, the range, and worries about where you are going to charge the thing and how long you'll be stuck there.\nYet the market certainly seems to reckon they are the future. Just look at the Tesla share price.  \nLast week it briefly nudged ahead of Toyota to become the world's most valuable car firm, even though the Japanese giant sold 30 times as many vehicles last year.\nOne reason is that Elon Musk has been teasing investors and rivals with the promise of \"battery day\" some time soon, at which he will announce a series of advancements in battery tech.\nAnd cars are not the only vast new battery market.\nYou might have seen a story I wrote about how the world is slowly weaning itself off coal.\nWell, gigantic batteries connected to our electricity grids are going to be central to the great renewable energy revolution too. \n\"We are entering into a nearly exponential growth phase\", says Prof Paul Shearing. He's an expert on emerging battery technologies at University College London. \nHe expects electric vehicles alone to drive European battery demand up by a factor of 10 this decade. \nBut this explosion in demand will only be possible if we can make batteries cheaper, more durable and more efficient.\nThat is a big ask for any technology but fear not, Mr Musk's proposed \"battery day\" comes thanks to a whole cascade of breakthroughs.\nThe first of these was announced just last week when the Chinese battery-maker that supplies most of the major car makers, including Tesla, revealed it had produced the first \"million mile battery\". \nContemporary Amperex Technology (CATL) says its new battery is capable of powering a vehicle for more than a million miles (1.2 million, to be precise - or 1.9 million km) over a 16-year lifespan.\nMost car batteries offer warranties for 60,000-150,000 miles over a three to eight-year period.\nThis is a huge improvement in battery life, but will cost just 10% more than existing products, says CATL chair, Zeng Yuqun.\nHaving a battery you never need to change is obviously good news for the electric car industry. But longer-lasting batteries are also essential for what's known as \"stationary\" storage too.\nThese are the batteries we can attach to wind turbines or solar panels so renewable energy is available when the sun isn't shining or the wind isn't blowing.\nFairly soon you might even want a stationary battery in your home to store cheap off-peak electricity, or to collect the power your own solar panels generate. \nThe next barrier that is likely to be broken is price.\nThe landmark challenge in the electric vehicle industry is to get a battery costing under $100 (£78) per kilowatt hour.\n\"At that point you start to get electric vehicles that are cheaper than the equivalent internal combustion vehicles,\" says Seth Weintraub, a US battery technology journalist.\nOnce that happens the internal combustion engine will be effectively dead., he says, comparing it to how digital killed off film cameras a decade ago.\n\"In car dealerships we're going to go from one electric vehicle in the back lot somewhere, to one gas vehicle in the back lot somewhere.\"  \nSo when will this crucial price-point be passed?\nHe believes it already has.  \nMr Weintraub says his sources tell him these batteries are going into Teslas right now, and thinks this will be one of Mr Musk's \"battery day\" revelations.\nCheaper batteries will address some of the other key concerns potential customers have.\nThat is because it will make it economical to put bigger batteries into cars.\nThat has two major advantages.\nFirst, it means they can go much further on a single charge, so you'll soon be able to buy cars with ranges of 400-500 miles (640-800km) or more.\nSecond, big batteries charge faster for the bulk of their capacity, so you might be able to get up to 300 miles of range with just 10 minutes of charging.\nThat's comparable to the time it takes to fill a car with petrol or diesel. \nSo expect Elon Musk to announce upgrades for the Model S and X which will combine 400-500 mile range with supercar performance, says Mr Weintraub.\nSo, where are we going to make all these wonderful new batteries?\nAgain, we are expecting some major announcements from Mr Musk. Earlier this month his private jet reportedly landed at Luton airport.\nThe man, who actor Robert Downey Jr used as inspiration for Marvel's Tony Stark in the 2008 film Iron Man, is believed to have been flown by helicopter to a 650-acre site just outside Bristol.\nThe location is reckoned to be the prime UK candidate for one of Tesla's \"Gigafactories\", the huge battery plants it's pioneering.\nAnd he is planning an even bigger factory in the US, probably in Austin, Texas.\nAccording to Seth Weintraub this one will be a \"Terafactory\".\nThat's quite an upgrade.  \nGigafactories were so called because they would produce batteries that could store billions of watt-hours of power.\nBy that reasoning a terafactory should be able to make batteries with a total capacity in the trillions of watt-hours.\nAnd the logic of Mr Musk's ever-expanding factories remains the same. The bigger the scale, the easier it will be to deliver cost-slashing innovations, he believes.\nSo where are all the battery chemicals going to come from?\nTesla's Chinese partner CATL has found a way to make batteries free of cobalt, at least for shorter-range vehicles.\nCobalt is expensive and a lot is sourced from DR Congo, where it has been associated with child labour.  \nThere are no plans to get rid of the key ingredient in lightweight batteries, lithium.\nThere are large supplies in salt deposits around the world, including the biggest single reserve - as yet unexploited - in the hauntingly beautiful Salar de Uyuni salt plain in the remote Bolivian Andes.\nThe problem is the current method of separating out the lithium in these deposits is slow and inefficient. \nThe biggest salt lake currently being mined is the Salar de Atacama in Chile.  And at their significantly lower altitude, the Chileans can use natural evaporation to crystallise the salts, driven by the intense sunshine of the Atacama Desert.\nDespite these advantages, the process still takes months, and only recovers about 30% of the available lithium.  \nWhich is where a wannabe Elon Musk-style tycoon with a similarly exotic name comes in.\nTeague Egan is working with scientists on what he says is a \"nanoparticle\" filter that can separate lithium from other salts in solution, and will recover more like 90% of the lithium.\nInstead of months, he reckons it could eventually take just a few days.\nMr Egan says his firm EnergyX is already talking to key players about applying the technology on a commercial scale.\nIf effective it could dramatically cut the cost of lithium - removing one of the biggest bottlenecks to the ramping up of battery production..\nWhich brings us back to my original premise - that batteries will be the most transformative part of Elon Musk's empire. \nMr Musk's ambition is to create the iPhone of cars - a must-buy product that revolutionises our driving experience, while also delivering him a big fat profit. \nThat's what will make us ditch our old diesel and petrol cars. \nBut there is also something much bigger at stake: climate change. \nIf cheaper, better batteries enable a rapid switch to electric vehicles, and give us renewable energy whatever the weather, then clearly they are going to be central to efforts to decarbonise our economy.  \nAstronauts blasting off into space are a lot more exciting than a grey box with a couple of wires attached. \nBut if that grey box helps us jettison fossil fuels, then the grey box wins in terms of its power to change our world. \nOf course, you may disagree. And if you do, then please tell me why. @BBCJustinR",

        "title": "Home insulation 'could create cheap jobs'",
        "description": "Making people's homes cosy is the cheapest way to create jobs as the UK prepares to fight recession, a report says. \nIts authors say a job insulating homes would be much cheaper than creating a road maintenance job, for example.\nJobs in building roads are more costly to create, as the work is heavily mechanised.\nThe figures will be sent to the Treasury, which is reviewing a package of job stimulus measures for July.\nThe report's authors say a job in home insulation can be created for £59,000 - that's far less than a road maintenance job, which is estimated by the government to be more than £250,000.\nThose figures include retrofitting 10 homes with insulation, and the road surface laid by a worker.\nThe report comes from a coalition of charities, businesses and pressure groups known as the Energy Efficiency Infrastructure Group (EEIG). \nTheir aim is to upgrade the UK's aged housing stock.\nThey say home insulation would create jobs in all areas of the UK as well as supporting the government's aim of net zero carbon emissions by 2050.\nIt would also have other benefits. It would cut local pollution; reduce bills to release cash back into the economy; and lower the costs of sickness caused by draughty homes.\nThe document estimates that 40,000 jobs could be created by the government in insulation over the next two years, and 150,000 by 2030. \nIts author, Pedro Guertler, told BBC News: \"Really this is a no-brainer. It's fantastically good value for money - it should have been done years ago. We can hit so many government objectives at the same time.\n\"It's obvious that insulating homes provides very good value - far, far better value for the taxpayer than building roads, for instance.\"\nThe government's manifesto promised £9.2bn for home energy efficiency, but few details have yet emerged. It also pledged £28bn on roads.\nSarah Kostense-Winterton, EEIG chair, said: \"Net zero plans will hit a wall if the government continues to sidestep serious action.\"\n\"Our country is in dire need of a green stimulus recovery. Surely there could be no better time to future-proof our homes while providing buoyancy to our drained economy?\"\nThe report says efficiency improvements in buildings so far are saving households up to £500 a year. But it notes that the current pace of decarbonisation is not yet on track for 2050.\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson said on May 14 that the government's commitment to net zero emissions by 2050 \"remains undiminished\" by the Covid crisis.\nMinisters are said to be seeking projects that are \"shovel-ready\" - that's ready to start creating jobs immediately. \nThe phrase was adopted by President Obama in the USA following the 2009 recession, but many big infrastructure projects proved far from ready.\nWe asked the Treasury if it had made value-for-money calculations on prospective job-creating activities. It hasn't yet replied. \nMeanwhile, the Local Government Association says in a separate report that nearly 700,000 direct jobs could be created in England's low-carbon and renewable energy economy by 2030, rising to more than 1.18 million by 2050.\nIt says the demand for \"green\" jobs will rapidly increase as the UK transitions to a net zero economy. \nThis, it maintains, will help to cushion job losses due to coronavirus.\nIt predicts that 46% of an estimated 700,000 low-carbon jobs by 2030 will be in clean electricity generation and providing low-carbon heat for homes and businesses.\nThe report forecasts that around 21% will be involved in installing energy efficiency products, while 14% will be involved in manufacturing low-emission vehicles and charging infrastructure.",

        "description": "The world needs a single goal for fighting the loss of nature, much like the 1.5C target for climate change, according to conservation experts.\nExtinctions of plants and animals should be kept well below 20 per year, they propose.\nLast year, a UN report found that around one million species are now threatened with extinction. \nProgress on biodiversity loss has been \"far too slow, limited or ineffective,\" said Prof Georgina Mace of UCL, London.\nAchieving the target should ensure that natural systems \"continue to function and meet the needs of people and the rest of life on Earth\", she said.\nThe coronavirus pandemic has put the spotlight on the critical balance between nature and people.  Scientists have long warned that close contact with wild animals through hunting, trade or habitat loss puts the world at increased risk of outbreaks of new diseases.\nYet, the timetable for setting new global biodiversity goals has been thrown into disarray by the pandemic. Meanwhile, we are running out of time to deal with the threat, conservation scientists warned last week.\nThey said human actions had pushed 500 mammals, birds, reptiles and amphibians to the brink of extinction, which is yet more evidence that the world is undergoing a sixth mass extinction.\nIn the new proposals, published in the journal Science, conservation experts in the UK and Germany call for a long-term goal to reduce species extinctions towards natural rates, with an easily measurable objective of fewer than 20 extinctions a year.\nThis should apply to all known species of plants, animals and fungi, both on land and in the oceans, they say.\nProf Richard Gregory from the RSPB/UCL described the target as a \"North Star\" for nature, \"a bright, visible destination for global society to move towards so that we bend the curve of biodiversity loss from the top down, and bottom up, recovering species populations by protecting and restoring our vital ecosystems\".  \n2020 was set to be a \"super year\" for biodiversity, according to the UN, with new goals and targets thrashed out at the meeting of the Convention on Biological Diversity, the international treaty tasked with producing the global plan for biodiversity.\nThe summit has now been postponed until 2021, along with the UN climate summit in Glasgow.\nFollow Helen on Twitter.",

        "title": "What is the Crew Dragon?",
        "description": "The Crew Dragon  launched astronauts from US soil for the first time since the last Shuttle flight in 2011. But it's a very different type of vehicle to Nasa's retired spaceplane.\nElon Musk says human spaceflight had always been the fundamental goal for his pioneering company SpaceX.\nThe entrepreneur achieved that ambition on Saturday 30 May 2020, when the Crew Dragon spacecraft carried Nasa astronauts Doug Hurley and Bob Behnken into orbit for a rendezvous with the International Space Station (ISS).\nBut the company had to walk before it could run. Crew Dragon evolved from an earlier design, called Dragon 1, which launched 20 times on missions to deliver cargo to the ISS between May 2012 and March 2020.\nIn May 2014, Musk unveiled the seven-seat Crew Dragon concept during an event at SpaceX's headquarters in Hawthorne, California. \nLike Dragon 1, the crewed version is a capsule design, making it more similar to the Apollo command modules that carried astronauts to the Moon than the winged space shuttle concept, which was conceived to carry both a crew and a large payload.\nFrom launch up until shortly before re-entry, the capsule is attached to a section called the trunk which has solar panels, heat-removal radiators and fins to provide stability during emergency aborts. Together, the capsule and trunk stand around 8.1m (26.7ft) tall, with a diameter of 4m (13ft).\nThe Crew Dragon is equipped with 16 Draco thrusters that are used to manoeuvre the vehicle in orbit. Each Draco is capable of producing 90 pounds of force in the vacuum of space.\nSpaceX engineer John Federspiel, explains: \"When we wanted to take Dragon and make it human-rated, I think we took a different approach to spaceship design than has previously been done, because we wanted this to feel like a 21st Century spaceship.\n\"Probably one of the biggest features of Dragon are the touchscreens on the inside. We designed them not just to be very functional, but with a user experience in mind.\"\nThe three large displays that allow Hurley and Behnken to monitor systems and control the spacecraft are a world away from the analogue buttons, dials and control stick that featured in the cockpit of the shuttle, which flew from 1981 to 2011.\nThe two Nasa astronauts have been working with SpaceX to get the vehicle ready for its first crewed flight. Hurley admits that the \"glass cockpit\" took a bit of getting used to. \n\"As far as actual physical feedback, you certainly don't get that from the touchscreen,\" he says.\n\"But what you do get is an indication of where you touched and that's part of the process of flying the vehicle manually is... I touched that button and that made the vehicle go up and I got the return flash that that's what the vehicle recognised as my input.\"\nFor the types of scenarios where astronauts might need to assume manual control of the normally autonomous craft, such as finishing off a docking sequence with the space station, the touchscreen controls are \"much more than adequate\", Hurley adds.\n\"It just might not be the same thing you'd want to use if you were suited up and trying to fly an entry or descent, for example, like we could do with the space shuttle,\" says Behnken.\nBut tailoring the spacecraft to the user experience involved more than just the design of the controls. \"When I think of comfort for the astronauts, it's really every aspect of how you could interact with the spaceship that comes to mind,\" says John Federspiel.\n\"We have three different seat sizes, we even go so far as moulding the foam around the astronaut's body so there's not any pressure points and it's just generally a pleasurable journey into space.\"\nWhen the astronaut gets ready to strap in, they plug an \"umbilical\" line from their seat into a port on the right thigh of their space suit. The umbilical provides the suit with life support systems, including air and power connections.\n\"The suit is really one part of the bigger Dragon system... we think of it as a suit-seat system,\" says Chris Trigg, space suits and crew equipment manager at SpaceX.\nBut in case anything goes wrong on the pad or during the climb to orbit, SpaceX has designed an innovative abort system for the capsule. The launch escape system (LES) consists of a set of SpaceX-designed SuperDraco engines that fire in the event of an emergency to propel the capsule and its crew safely away from the rocket.\nCommenting on the LES, Doug Hurley says: \"That perspective for me is huge compared to shuttle, where there were what we call 'black zones'... scenarios where it didn't really matter if you had the right combination of failures, you were likely not going to survive.\"\nHurley adds that the capsule design is safer than a winged vehicle under most circumstances.\nCrew Dragon is also designed to be \"two-fault tolerant\". This means that any two things can fail, such as a flight computer and a thruster, and the spacecraft can still bring the crew home safely.\nThe vehicle is designed to dock with the space station autonomously - that is, without having to be guided in by a human. Jessica Jensen, director of Starship mission hardware and operation at SpaceX, says: \"We have GPS sensors on Dragon, but also cameras and imaging sensors such as Lidar on the nosecone as it's approaching the space station.\n\"All these sensors are feeding data back to our flight computer to say: 'Hey, how far away am I from the space station? What's my relative velocity to the space station?'\"\nThe flight computer then uses algorithms that determine - based on this information - how to fire the thrusters to most effectively get to the docking target.\nWhen it returns to Earth, the Crew Dragon can't simply land on a runway like the space shuttle. \"I think there's an argument that the return is more dangerous in some ways than the ascent,\" says Elon Musk.\nDuring re-entry, the heat shield must survive temperatures hotter than the surface of the Sun, as the Crew Dragon screams through the atmosphere at up to 25 times the speed of sound.\nThere's a minor chance that the spacecraft's asymmetric design - driven by the placement of its emergency escape system - could cause it to roll too much. Musk has said in the past that the issue, known as roll instability, has been extensively studied, but that it still worries him.\nThen, after the fiery re-entry phase, the spacecraft needs to deploy four parachutes to slow its descent. \nFinally, the Crew Dragon splashes down in the Atlantic Ocean, 450km off the coast of Florida, where recovery ships will take the astronauts to safety and retrieve the capsule. \nHurley says that while he and Behnken - along with others at Nasa - provided input, \"this spacecraft - Crew Dragon - is SpaceX's design, from start to finish. Make no mistake about that\".\nHe adds: \"Just to see the vehicle come from not very much, a preliminary design, to where it is today, the operability of the vehicle, the clean lines, how it is inside the vehicle, how it is for a crew... we're just excited to put it through its paces.\"\nFollow Paul on Twitter.",

        "title": "Evolution of the spacesuit",
        "description": "The spacesuits worn by astronauts for the Crew Dragon mission have been getting a lot of attention. How do they differ from other astronaut attire down the years?\nThe futuristic flight suits worn by Doug Hurley and Bob Behnken during Saturday's successful launch look a world away from the bulky orange shuttle flight suits worn when astronauts last launched from Florida's Kennedy Space Center.\nThe helmets are 3D-printed and the gloves are touchscreen-sensitive.\nBut their primary purpose remains the same - to protect crew members from depressurisation, where air is lost from the capsule. The suits also ensure astronauts have sufficient oxygen and regulate their temperature. A communications link and breathable air are provided via a single \"umbilical\" cable in the seat that plugs in to the suit.\nThe Starman suits, as they've been called, are all in one piece and customised for the astronaut. Their look was conceived by Hollywood costume designer Jose Fernandez, who has worked on Captain America: Civil War and Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice.\nBut they are just designed for use inside the SpaceX capsule, known as the Crew Dragon, and are not suitable for use on spacewalks.\nAerospace giant Boeing also has a contract with Nasa to carry astronauts to the space station in its CST-100 Starliner spacecraft. It has developed a pressure suit to protect astronauts during the key phases of launch and re-entry.\nThe Boeing Blue suits are about 40% lighter than earlier generations of spacesuits worn by American astronauts - and more flexible.\nThey contain different internal layers to keep astronauts cool. The suit also has touchscreen-sensitive gloves - so astronauts can work with tablets in the spacecraft. The soft, hood-like helmet features a wide polycarbonate visor to give Starliner passengers better peripheral vision throughout their ride to and from space.\nZips in the torso area will make it easier for astronauts to comfortably transition from sitting to standing.\nIn October 2019, Nasa shared a close-up look at two next-generation suits for the agency's Artemis programme. Under this effort, Nasa will seek to return astronauts to the Moon by 2024, using the agency's Orion spacecraft.\nOne of the suits is called the Orion Crew Survival System, and is comparable to the suits used by SpaceX and Boeing. It recalls the so-called Pumpkin suits used by space shuttle astronauts, but is more lightweight.\nThe other suit, called the Exploration Extravehicular Mobility Unit (xEMU) suit is designed to be worn on the surface of the Moon. It is much bulkier than the pressure suits designed to be worn inside spacecraft.\nThis is because it needs to protect the wearer from temperature extremes outside the walls of the spacecraft. It is also designed to provide some shielding against micrometeorites and other small particles of space debris. In these respects, it is similar to suits previously used for spacewalking at the International Space Station (ISS).\nThere are two suits used for spacewalking at the ISS. One is the Russian Orlan type, which was first used in December 1977.\nThe Orlan is a one-piece spacesuit. The \"backpack\" opens like a fridge door, allowing the spacewalker to climb inside.\nNasa's Extravehicular Mobility Suit (EMU) was introduced in 1981 and is the other suit used at the space station.\nUnlike the Orlan, the EMU comes in separate pieces, with a bottom and top half. The semi-rigid suit provides around 8.5 hours of life support for its wearer outside in the vacuum of space. \nAstronauts travelling to the ISS train with both suits.\nThe suit worn by Apollo astronauts on the Moon was also called the EMU - though it's different from the modern design. It was the result of years of development.\nSpacesuits have come a long way since the first spacewalk by the late cosmonaut Alexei Leonov in March 1965.\nLeonov's suit inflated after he stepped out into the vacuum, so that his hands came out of his gloves. Only by bleeding air out of the suit, which put the cosmonaut at risk of the bends, was he able to get back inside the spacecraft.\n.",

        "title": "Who are the astronauts?",
        "description": "Two US astronauts have achieved a world first by launching to the International Space Station (ISS) aboard a spacecraft built by Elon Musk's SpaceX. Here, BBC News profiles the crew members.\nDoug Hurley and Bob Behnken have broken a nine-year hiatus for Nasa, becoming the first astronauts to launch from US soil since the retirement of the space shuttle in 2011. \nIn the intervening years, Nasa bought seats for its astronauts - at a cost of tens of millions of dollars per flight - on the Russian Soyuz.\nBut officials have also worked with Elon Musk's company SpaceX and aerospace giant Boeing to develop new, American spacecraft capable of ferrying humans to and from the ISS - under the space agency's Commercial Crew Program.\nMusk's vehicle was first to fly; Hurley and Behnken travelled to the ISS in the sleek Crew Dragon spacecraft.\n\"It's well past time to be launching an American rocket from the Florida coast to the International Space Station and I am certainly honoured to be a part of it,\" Hurley, 53, said at the beginning of May, before the flight.\nBehnken, 49, added: \"On my first flight... I didn't have a son, so I'm really excited to share the mission with him.\"\nNasa chose two of its most experienced astronauts to help California-based SpaceX ready the Crew Dragon for launch. The two are also longstanding friends.\n\"Being lucky enough to fly with your best friend... I think there's a lot of people who wish they could do that,\" says Hurley.\nWhen they launched atop a Falcon 9 rocket, their spouses knew exactly what they were going through. That's because they're astronauts too.\nMarine Colonel Hurley's wife Karen Nyberg flew into space twice - aboard the shuttle and the Soyuz - retiring from Nasa this year. They have a 10-year-old son, Jack, whose formative years were shaped by space travel.\nNyberg began training for a six-month space station mission just a few months after Jack's birth. In the meantime, Hurley was preparing for his own flight - piloting the last ever shuttle mission. Sometimes, Nyberg took Jack to Russia, at other times he stayed at home in Texas.\n\"Literally from the time Jack was old enough to comprehend things, he was either going to Russia or Skyping with mommy. That's just the way it was,\" Hurley told the Houston Chronicle in 2013.\nAir Force Colonel Behnken is married to Megan McArthur, who flew on the last mission to service the Hubble Space Telescope in 2009. \nAs an active member of the astronaut corps, she is a potential candidate to be the first woman on the Moon when Nasa returns in 2024. Their son, Theo, is six.\nHurley, Behnken, Nyberg and McArthur all graduated from the same astronaut class (2000) and attended each other's weddings. The men are so used to each other's company, they now have a spooky rapport.\nThey \"can predict - almost by body language - what the person's opinion is or what their next action is going to be,\" Behnken told CNN before the launch. \"We've just been doing this so long that it's kind of like having a second set of hands.\"\nHurley says of Behnken: \"I know instantaneously when I've not done something correctly - just put it that way. He doesn't have a good poker face.\" \nBut Behnken admits Hurley is the more organised of the two.\nThe older of the two men was raised in the hamlet of Apalachin, in upstate New York. \"It was just a great small town existence... we didn't get a stoplight until I was, I think, in college,\" Hurley said in 2009.\nBehnken hails from  St Ann, a suburb of St Louis, Missouri. In 2010, he described it as \"a blue collar kind of a neighbourhood\", adding: \"I guess, in my bag of tricks... I'm more of a working class sort of a person.\"\nHe took jobs in construction before deciding that working outdoors in the summer heat wasn't for him. \nBoth men went to college on military scholarships and gained undergraduate degrees in engineering. While Behnken went on to complete a PhD at Caltech - the elite institute featured in the Big Bang Theory television show - Hurley became an officer in the Marines.\nThey both subsequently trained as military test pilots - at different training schools. It's been the archetypal background for Nasa's astronauts since the days of its first intake - the Mercury Seven.\n\"When I showed up [at Nasa] it was like: 'Well, I have a PhD and an MD,' and I'm sitting there going, 'Mmm, wow! Maybe I was a bit of a slacker',\" said Hurley. \n\"But you know, your professional development as a pilot and the thousands of hours you get as a pilot... brings something to the table.\"\nHurley and Behnken were selected as astronaut candidates three years before the shuttle Columbia broke up on re-entry, killing seven crew members. After the disaster, Nasa decided it would retire the shuttle, handing over space station transport to private firms.\nThus, when the two men were finally assigned their flights, the shuttle programme was in its final phase. Their missions focused on fulfilling Nasa's prior commitments to complete construction of the ISS, including the delivery of crew compartments designed to fit in the shuttle's payload bay.\nWhen the spaceplane was retired, the pair were assigned to the Commercial Crew Program. In August 2018, Hurley and Behnken were announced as the prime crew for Demo-2, the first flight of SpaceX's vehicle with humans onboard.\n\"Bob and I, the last two years, have essentially been living in California, working hand-in-hand with the folks at SpaceX to get us to this point,\" Hurley said this month.\nThey've had to get used to the Crew Dragon's touchscreen controls after previously working with the chunky buttons on shuttle instrument panels.\nHurley says a background in evaluating military aircraft as test pilots proved crucial in their work with SpaceX.\n\"That, in and of itself, helped both of us tremendously, because all along the process that you see in the military, there are delays, there are technical challenges, there are things that you don't expect and you have to work through them,\" he explained.\nSetbacks - including two spectacular explosions that destroyed a rocket and one of the Crew Dragon capsules - have seen the mission slip by nearly four years from its original date of October 2016. \n\"We were well-prepared for that part of it, when I think it caused some frustration within Nasa as launch dates weren't made,\" explained Hurley.\nDespite bumps in the road, Behnken's enthusiasm remained undimmed: \"It's probably the dream of every test pilot school student to have the opportunity to fly on a brand new spaceship.\"\nHurley told CNN: \"From a first flight standpoint, certainly, there might be some greater quantifiable risk to some degree.\n\"But probably no different to any other spaceflight we've flown humans on before.\"\nFollow Paul on Twitter.",

        "title": "DNA study reveals Ireland's age of 'god-kings'",
        "description": "DNA has been used to confirm the existence of an elite social class in the Stone Age inhabitants of Ireland.\nIt's one of the earliest examples of such a hierarchy among human societies.\nA key piece of evidence comes from an adult male buried at the 5,000-year-old Newgrange monument; his DNA revealed that his parents were first-degree relatives, possibly brother and sister.\nHe was one member of an extended \"clan\" that was buried at impressive stone monuments across Ireland.\nThe Irish elites were established during Neolithic times, when people first started farming. The researchers extracted DNA from 44 ancient individuals from across Ireland and sequenced their genomes (the full complement of genetic material contained in the nuclei of cells).\nEvidence of incestuous unions like that found at Newgrange are rare in human history; they are taboo for inter-linked biological and cultural reasons. Where they do occur, it is often within royal dynasties that have been granted divine status.\nBrother-sister marriages are found among the pharaohs of ancient Egypt and the \"god-kings\" of South America's Inca Empire. Tutankhamun's parents, for example, are thought by some to have been full siblings. Among these cultures, rulers drew on aspects of religion to legitimise their power and wielded it through the construction of extravagant monuments.\nCommenting on the genetic patterns seen in the man from Newgrange, Lara Cassidy, assistant professor at Trinity College Dublin, said: \"I'd never seen anything like it.\n\"We all inherit two copies of the genome, one from our mother and one from our father; well, this individual's copies were extremely similar, a tell-tale sign of close inbreeding. In fact, our analyses allowed us to confirm that his parents were first-degree relatives.\"\nThe Newgrange monument in County Meath is a kidney-shaped mound covering an area of more than one acre. It's part of a tradition of elaborate monuments built with large stones, or megaliths, in Atlantic Europe during the Neolithic.\nOlder than Stonehenge and the Pyramids of Giza, the site is famous for its annual solar alignment where the winter solstice sunrise illuminates the inner chamber in a blast of light. The man's remains were laid in a richly decorated recess in the inner chamber.\n\"The prestige of the burial makes this very likely a socially sanctioned union and speaks of a hierarchy so extreme that the only partners worthy of the elite were family members, said Prof Dan Bradley, also from Trinity College.\nDr Cassidy, who is first author of the new study published in Nature, told BBC News: \"It's an extreme of what elites do - marrying within your kin group allows you to keep power within your 'clan',\n\"But elites also break lots of rules, to separate themselves from the rest of the population... it's a bit chicken and egg: by breaking these rules you probably make yourself seem even more divine.\"\nRemarkably, a local myth resonates with both the DNA results and the Newgrange solar phenomenon. The story was first recorded in the 11th Century AD - four millennia after the construction of Newgrange - and tells of a builder-king who restarted the daily solar cycle by sleeping with his sister.\nThe Middle Irish place name for the neighbouring Dowth passage tomb, Fertae Chuile, is based on this lore and can be translated as \"Hill of Sin\".\nDr Tom Booth, senior research scientist at London's Francis Crick Institute, who was not involved with the study, called the study \"impressive\", further describing it as \"the most detailed picture yet of the genetics of people who inhabited Britain and Ireland during the Neolithic period\".\nHe added: \"Given how remote these societies are from our own, I am wary of talking about dynasties or monarchs as we understand them today, and people anticipating a Neolithic Game of Thrones may have to have a cold shower.\n\"But certainly the evidence is quite convincing that certain megalithic tombs in Ireland were reserved for people who were biologically more closely related to one another, including potentially prestigious groups of families who married amongst themselves.\"\nThe team unearthed a web of distant familial connections between the man from Newgrange and other individuals from passage tomb sites across the country, including the \"mega-cemeteries\" of Carrowmore and Carrowkeel in County Sligo.\n\"It seems what we have here is a powerful extended kin-group, who had access to elite burial sites in many regions of the island for at least half a millennium,\" explained Dr Cassidy.\nTom Booth said: \"In Britain, recent discoveries that some tombs were built over the remains of timber houses has been used to suggest that these sites were linked to particular families, but solid evidence for who ended up in these tombs and why has always been elusive.\"\nThe ancient genomic survey also uncovered the earliest diagnosed case of Down's syndrome - in a male infant buried 5,500 years ago in the Poulnabrone portal tomb, County Clare.\n\"He was interred within a sacred place; he was breastfed before his death,\" explained Dr Cassidy. \"It's an interesting glimpse at what the social values of this society might be.\n\"People with disability can sometimes be invisible within the archaeological record. I think it's really nice that we can now shed a light on this with ancient genomes.\"\nIreland's Neolithic inhabitants traced their origins to an expansion of people out of Anatolia (modern Turkey) around 6,000-7,000 years ago. This migration transformed Europe's way of life from one focused on hunting to one based on agriculture. Genetically, Ireland's first farmers were most closely related to people living at broadly the same time in Iberia (modern Spain and Portugal).\nOver generations, the farmers traversed the Mediterranean from Anatolia to Iberia, weaving their way up the French coast before making their way to Ireland by sea.\nOn reaching the shores of this North Atlantic landmass, the new migrants quickly displaced the local Mesolithic hunter-gatherers, who were genetically similar to pre-farming peoples across Europe. However, their DNA shows they developed a distinctive character after being isolated for centuries.\nTheir genetic code shows little sign of interaction with similar populations in Britain, suggesting the Irish Sea posed a formidable barrier to contact in the centuries before farming.\nDNA predicts that Ireland's hunter-gatherers had a striking combination of dark skin and blue eyes. By contrast, the Anatolian farmers probably had paler skin with brown eyes. \nThe small population of hunters may have been overwhelmed when the farmers arrived with bigger numbers. But they didn't completely vanish. \nTwo individuals from a wedge tomb at Parknabinnia, County Clare, showed high levels of Mesolithic ancestry. Clearly, Neolithic farmers sometimes integrated the hunters into their communities.\nOn whether the results could apply to other geographic regions, Tom Booth explained: \"The evidence we have from earlier periods of the Neolithic in Britain and Ireland suggests that there was a looser link between tombs and families. \n\"People who belonged to particular paternal lineages were more often buried in megalithic tombs in these periods, but lower occurrences of close biological relatives suggest that familial links don't give us the whole story. Social developments leading to strong associations between families and megalithic tombs may have been specific to later Neolithic societies in Ireland.\"\nFollow Paul on Twitter.",

        "title": "The woman making history in sea and space",
        "description": "Making headlines is never something that has motivated Kathy Sullivan. \nAlready in the history books as the first US woman to complete a spacewalk in 1984, the 68-year-old found herself in the news again this week after becoming the first woman to travel almost seven miles (11km) to reach the lowest known point in the ocean.\nThe two missions, total opposites in the minds of some, represent two extremes of a lifelong passion for Dr Sullivan: to understand the world around her as much as possible. \n\"I was always a pretty adventurous and curious child with interests wider and more varied than the stereotype of a little girl,\" Sullivan told the BBC in a phone interview from the Pacific Ocean. \nShe was born in New Jersey in 1951 and spent her childhood in California. Her father was an aerospace engineer who, along with her mother, would always encourage their two children to think freely and join in with discussions.\n\"They really fed our curiosity on anything we were curious about or interested in,\" she says. \"They were our best allies to explore that interest further and see where it might take us: it might die out in a couple of days, it might be something that became our best hobby or it might turn into the central focus of our career.\"\nBy the time they were five or six, it was already clear her brother wanted to grow up to fly aeroplanes. Sullivan, meanwhile, became fascinated by maps and learning more about the interesting places on them. \n\"Both of our careers have basically been remarkably wonderful fulfilments of those early dreams,\" she reflects.\nAs a little girl, Sullivan was already devouring every newspaper, magazine and television report she could find on the subject of exploration. It was a time when Jacques Cousteau was making pioneering undersea discoveries and the Mercury Seven were propelling the image of astronauts into America's mind.\n\"I saw these people - they happened to all be men, that didn't bother me... I saw there are people in the world that have continually inquisitive, adventurous lives: they're going to places no-one's been and they have this store of knowledge and they're learning more.\"\n\"My way of thinking about it never crystallised into: I want that job, I want that title or that label,\" she explains about her ambitions as a teenager. \"But what I knew really clearly was what I wanted my life to be like, I wanted it to have that mixture of inquiry and adventure and competency.\"\nHer pursuit first took her into foreign languages and then, as an undergraduate, into the study of earth sciences. Back then, around 1970, it was an area still overwhelmingly male-dominated. \n\"The guys went out to field camps and they dressed all grubby and they never showered and they could swear and be real, rowdy little boys again to their hearts' content,\" she says. Her presence was treated like a disturbance to their fun.\nSullivan felt that by this time, there was already some change under way. She was never, for instance, harassed or bullied for her gender. \"In fact, in a couple of key instances, I had some tremendously supportive male professors and colleagues that were definitely, definitely on my side and just saw me as a very capable fellow student, very capable geologist, very capable fellow shipmate.\"\nSullivan saw in her marine science professors her ambitions for her own life realised - and so began to further her studies in oceanography. \nShe applied to Nasa as a way to deepen her knowledge of the earth further still. \"My primary motivation for applying to be an astronaut was - if I somehow beat the odds and actually got chosen - I could get to see the earth from orbit with my own eyes.\" \nSullivan was admitted into Nasa's class of 1978. It was the first recruitment drive that brought women into its astronaut ranks.\nSix were selected from the class of 35 and Sally Ride, seen on the far left of the image above, became the first of them to fly into space in 1983. \nRide would later recount the unique challenges of being the first women recruited into the space program. Engineers tried to design special make-up kits and wildly overestimated how many tampons would be needed for week-long missions.\nSullivan's first mission, STS-41-G, set off on 5 October 1984. It was the 13th flight of Nasa's Space shuttle program and the sixth trip for the Space Shuttle Challenger.\nOn 11 October 1984 Sullivan made history when she became the first American woman to leave a spacecraft, along with fellow mission specialist David Leestma, on a spacewalk to demonstrate the feasibility of an orbital refuelling system. \nShe went on to take part in two more missions, including the 1990 launch of the Hubble Space Telescope. She logged 532 hours in space in total and was inducted into the Astronaut Hall of Fame in 2004. \n\"My spacewalk was three and a half hours long. It's a spacewalk that counts but that's actually very short as spacewalks go,\" Sullivan says. \n\"I was just delighted to see women come after me and do, you know, much more elaborate, much more complicated, much more demanding spacewalks.\"\nOver the years, Sullivan has also been buoyed to see women increasingly involved at senior levels throughout the space program - including in commanding roles and managing missions from the ground.\n\"These are all wonderful things and I think help show young girls that you can make your way to these places,\" she says. \"No one's promising you a primrose path. You know, you're gonna have your setbacks, you're gonna have to persist and persevere. \n\"You're going to have to fight back sometimes. But the door is at least ajar - it's not wide open, but you can make your way through it.\"\nLast year an all-female spacewalk eventually happened for the first time. It was a nice little \"bookend\" moment for Sullivan, especially given Christina Koch wore the same life support system backpack Sullivan had all the way back in 1984. \nUpon leaving Nasa in 1993, Sullivan went on to serve as chief scientist at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and later as its administrator under President Obama. Between those positions she spent years as president and CEO of the Center of Science and Industry (COSI) and in a distinguished position at Ohio State University. \nThe surprise invitation for her latest adventure came from Victor Vescovo, a former naval officer and investor who has spent years and millions of dollars on technology to take people underwater, to the depths of our planet.\nThe Challenger Deep is the deepest known part of the earth's seabed. Part of the Mariana Trench, it is almost seven miles (11km) below the ocean's surface, 200 miles southwest of Guam in the Pacific Ocean. \nIt was first reached in 1960 by two men - US Navy Lt Don Walsh and Swiss oceanographer Jacques Piccard - and has only been reached a handful of times since, including by Titanic director James Cameron.\nVescovo, a keen explorer himself, has said the primary motivation for his private endeavour is to spur interest in the sea and science. Last year he became the first person to visit the deepest points in every ocean using his two-tonne Deep Sea Vehicle (DSV) Limiting Factor, launched from dedicated support ships. \nSullivan said he contacted her via email to invite her on his latest mission, because he thought it was \"really time\" for a woman to get down there.\nShe suspects it was her friendship with Don Walsh, the oceanographer first to reach the Challenger Deep, that earned her the recommendation. After researching Vescovo's endeavour, she excitedly agreed.\nLast Sunday she accompanied him down more than 35,800ft (10,900m) inside the two-person submersible - becoming only the eighth person and first woman to reach the bottom.\nShe describes the journey as like being inside a magic sphere. Seeing the lander - an unmanned robotic vehicle that descends to the seafloor - alongside them at such depth was like stumbling upon \"an alien space probe\", she says.\n\"I mean, it's just magical that we can go to these places because of the ingenuity and the engineering prowess of these teams of people, we can take our bodies to places that we really have no business being. \n\"And we can do that, essentially, in street clothes. I mean, I ate lunch 31,000ft below the surface of the ocean on Sunday. That's crazy.\"\nEYOS Expeditions, which organised the expedition, also facilitated a call between the pair and the International Space Station (ISS) when they emerged - a fitting representation of the two extremes of humankind's exploration. \nIn a press release for the dive, the organisers drew the comparison between Vescovo's enterprise and what is being done with SpaceX - saying they both show the \"exciting potential\" of private companies contributing to technological advancement worldwide. \nSullivan believes that as nations and individuals we should continue to push the boundaries of our knowledge about the world we live in.\nShe also expresses her hope for improved diversity and female representation across the world of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (Stem). \n\"The stereotype is a very dull person in a lab coat that just knows numbers and just knows principles,\" she says. \"But in so many fields where science and technology are at the core of what you're doing, it's completely creative.\"\nSo does she have any plans for her next adventure?\n\"I think exploration can take many forms - it doesn't have to be venturing off physically to the middle of the Pacific Ocean or to the earth orbit,\" she says. \"There are topics, there are subjects, that there are lots of dimensions to exploring. \n\"I think I will be exploring until they put me in a little wooden box at some point in the future.\"",

        "title": "X Factor star reveals 'heartbreaking' racism",
        "description": "Singer Alexandra Burke has spoken out about her experiences of racism in the music industry, revealing she was asked to bleach her skin \"to look whiter\".\nAfter winning X Factor, Burke said she was told she would \"have to work 10 times harder than a white artist, because of the colour of your skin\".\nIn a 15-minute Instagram video, she recalls being told: \"You can't have braids, you can't have an afro.\n\"You have to have hair... that appeals to white people.\"\nThe 31-year-old star, who won the TV talent show in 2008 at the age of 19, described the experiences as \"heartbreaking\".\nBurke, who refused to bleach her skin, said she was inspired to tell her story by fellow X Factor contestant Misha B, who recently spoke out about \"being devalued\" at the hands of the music industry.\nMisha B claimed the X Factor projected \"this angry black girl narrative\", using words such as \"feisty\" and \"bully\" to describe her after one a live performance on the show. The 2011 contestant said it left her feeling suicidal.\n\"I could have spoken up much earlier, but was too scared to,\" said Burke, whose Instagram post has attracted a lot of attention, and sympathy, on social media.\nThe music star revealed the micro-aggressions she experienced at the hands of record labels, being told regularly that she \"comes across aggressive\".\nShe said she was told: \"You can't release this kind of music, because white people don't understand that\", and added: \"I am so upset with myself that I allowed that.\" \nBurke, whose hit singles Hallelujah, Bad Boys and All Night Long were all nominated for Brit Awards, also played the lead in the critically acclaimed West End musical The Bodyguard.\nThe singer said was told: \"Because you're a black girl, you won't make it that far in the industry... if you were white, you would be bigger than what you are now, you could sell more records, you'd be a Brit Award-winner\".\n\"It's hurtful,\" she added.\nShe was raised in north London by her mother, Soul II Soul singer Melissa Bell, who died in August 2017 - just before Burke was due to take part in Strictly Come Dancing.\nShe recalled how one journalist accused her of \"being a diva\" when she asked not to do any publicity on the show's red carpet, which happened to be taking place on the same day as her mother died.\n\"That was the image they had of me, because of the papers.\" she said. \"I was so scared on that show. So many trolls, telling me all kinds of stuff. \n\"I have no idea how I got through it. I don't even like thinking about that experience. It's simply because of me being a black, strong woman. \n\"I can speak up for myself because that's how I've been taught. But I would never do it in a way that offends people or hurts anyone.\"\nShe said the Black Lives Matter movement had persuaded her to share her experiences because \"the truth is all we've got\".\n\"I just feel like people need to not see colour,\" said Burke. \"My mum always raised me to never see colour. I will continue that way because that's what makes me happy. \n\"People are people. We are all human, we all have feelings. So be kind.\"",

        "description": "Scottish author Irvine Welsh has addressed about 1,000 protesters at a Black Lives Matter demonstration in Edinburgh.\nThe Trainspotting writer criticised the statue of Henry Dundas, which stands at the top of the Melville Monument in St Andrew Square.\nThe 19th Century politician delayed the abolition of the slave trade.\nMr Welsh said it was like having a statue of shamed TV presenter Jimmy Saville on a plinth in a park.\nHe said of Dundas: \"Nobody did more to prevent the abolition of slavery.\n\"And make no mistake, they knew this was coming, that's why they put him so high.\n\"All this is, is a continuation, it goes right on to this day.\n\"The establishment have always protected the paedophiles in their midst.\n\"So imagine a statue of Sir Jimmy Savile, looking down at us with a cigar. Well this is Jimmy Savile times at least 100,000.\"\nJoseph Malik, organiser for Black Lives Matter event, said he was pleased Irvine Welsh had shown his support by coming to the event.\n\"What we want to achieve is to bring shame on Edinburgh for having a statue of a mass murderer,\" he said. \"I hope it is removed.\n\"Racism is still very much alive in Scotland and I was threatened online for coming here today.\n\"They also threatened my son which is despicable.\"\nThe monument is to be dedicated to those enslaved because of Dundas' actions.\nNew signage will explain that he was \"instrumental in deferring the abolition of the Atlantic slave trade\".\nDevon Singh, 27, from Edinburgh, said she thought there had been a good turnout at the protest.\n\"I came here today because this has gone on long enough and I wanted to make a stand and fight for what's right,\" she said.\nStephanie Dyer, 23, from Edinburgh, said: \"I want to take a stand and make my voice known.\n\"When I moved here from London I was called the N word and monkey, and strangers in the street pulled my hair because they were interested in it.\n\"There are hate crime laws in Scotland but it feels just like lip service as we face racism on a daily basis.\n\"I don't want platitudes, I want change.\"\nAislinn Prior, 29, who moved from London to Edinburgh two years ago, said: \"I'm here to take action and to show its not just a hashtag, I want to show solidarity and to make a change.\n\"I think schools need to teach a more accurate depiction of history in Scotland.\"\nNicole Watson, 25, from Edinburgh, said she had researched the history of Dundas when she heard about the protest.\nShe said: \"He was personally responsible for the prolonged slavery process for 15 years during which time 650,000 slaves were transported and traded in Scotland.\n\"I don't want him wiped from the history books but I don't want to overtly celebrate him.\"\nTJ Lamothe, 14, a pupil from Edinburgh Academy, said: \"I came here today to actively protest against racism.\n\"Racism is a real problem and being able to share my views and experiences can help educate others.\n\"When I was 10 years old I was in a supermarket and I had left my mum to walk around the shop and this person pushed bananas in my face and called me a monkey.\n\"I knew at the time that some people didn't like black people but it was my first experience of it and I didn't know what to do.\"",

        "title": "Rough but not Rowdy: Dylan's new album is a masterpiece ★★★★★",
        "description": "There is a new genre in pop music emerging. It's not coming from the housing estates of Tottenham, or the studios of LA. It hasn't stumbled out of the clubs of Ibiza, or drifted into mainstream from the back streets of Rio. It isn't radical or exciting or rebellious or loud. It is something else altogether: a form that has only just become possible, which is not down to technological progress, but the more mundane inevitability of the ageing process. \nThe baby-faced pop pioneers of yore; the beautiful young things who lit up a dreary post-war world, are coming to the end of their long and winding roads. It is an untrodden path. There are no precedents. It is up to those original trailblazers to define the aesthetics of an elderly star's final act. \nJohnny Cash set a tone with his Rick Rubin-produced American Recordings series, particularly American IV: The Man Comes Around (2002), which saw the Country legend take on contemporary pop. Stripped back and raw, his voice was less elastic and peppy, but had gained a richness and resonance that gave the songs a melancholic beauty.  \nBobby Womack went down a similar hip-collaboration route for his final album The Bravest Man in the Universe (2012), made with Blur's Damon Albarn and produced by Richard Russell. Womack's voice has the vintage wine vibe of Cash's, but this time it's the sound of '60s soul distilled through decades of hard living and regret. \nDavid Bowie's Blackstar (2016), released on his 69th birthday, two days before he died, consolidated the aesthetics of the late-career-pop-album just as Rembrandt's final paintings set the standard for an ageing artist's final flourish. It was nostalgic, prophetic, and philosophical.\nAs was Leonard Cohen's You Want it Darker, which came out later in the year.  \nWistfulness, wisdom, and vocal character rather than dynamic range, appear to be the dominant themes of this new category. \nThey are all there to be heard in Marianne Faithfull's Negative Capability (2018), in which she covers It's All Over Now, Baby Blue, written by her old friend Bob Dylan, the 2016 Nobel Laureate and most recent entrant to the ranks of the late career album brigade.\nRough and Rowdy Ways has all the hallmarks of the genre. It's not trying to impress or please. There's no obvious attempt to mask a weary, limited voice or occasionally garbled words. The pill isn't being sugared. What's the point? Nobody wants to hear sweet talk from of septuagenarian. \nTruth is the talisman, tell it like it is. \nAnd that is what Dylan does, starting with I Contain Multitudes, a folksy confessional about his nature and influences.\nWilliam Blake, The Rolling Stones, Anne Frank, Beethoven, Chopin and Indiana Jones are all name-checked in a lyrical story told in a musically simple song about a complex man, which opens with these words:\nToday, tomorrow, and yesterday, too\nThe flowers are dyin' like all things do\nLater, we get an early taste of his self-deprecating humour and constant cultural references (David Bowie in this instance) that are present throughout the album:\nOh, while I cannot frolic with all the young dudes\nI contain multitudes\nThe second track, False Prophet - a slow, bluesy number - has a heavier tone where Bob gets growly and Socratic, proclaiming he is an…\nEnemy of the unlived meaningless life\nI ain't no false prophet\nI just know what I know\nI go where only the lonely go \nI just don't know if he felt any pressure writing this album, the first he's penned since being announced a Nobel Laureate, but he is on top form. It's hard to produce a lyric nowadays that makes you listen in this multi-sensory, multi-media world of ours, but he succeeds time after time.\nMy Own Version of You, a low tempo, rockabilly-infused track sees the singer in the role of Victor Frankenstein; he's taking \"blood from a cactus, gunpowder from ice\", and \"going to bring someone to life in more ways than one\". It's a slippery, elliptical song that is at once a million miles from Blowin' in the Wind, while at the same time being so clearly from the same mind with its themes of identity and existence and time. All of which are revisited in track five, Black Rider, a quieter song with a Spanish guitar, which reflects on a life on the road. \nLike much of Rough and Rowdy Ways, it reminds me of Tom Waits's throatily-sung album called Black Rider (1993): not only the name but also the coarseness and urgency of Dylan's delivery. \nGoodbye Jimmy Reed is a storming 12-bar blues number, which is as close to classic Dylan as the album gets - there's even the squeal of a harmonica. It is also the most obviously autographical song, with a hint of old scores not yet settled:\nYou won't amount to much, the people said\n'Cause I didn't play guitar behind my head\nAgain, the writing is terrific. For my money Leonard Cohen was the better poet of the two folksters, but the Canadian didn't have Dylan's cantankerous edge, which leads to unforgettable lines such as this from Goodbye Jimmy Reed:\nI need you like my head needs a noose \nThe atmosphere changes markedly in Mother of Muses, a hymn-like lament that is quite simply beautiful, made more so as Dylan struggles for the high notes: a regal voice of pop facing up to his fading faculties like King Lear. It's a deeply romantic piece: an ode to America with a Walt Whitman quality, in which our protagonist tells us he is falling in love with Calliope (the Greek muse of epic poetry).\nMother of Muses, wherever you are\nI've already outlived my life by far\nThe album finishes with three increasingly long songs, ending with a 16-minute disc 2, a previously released track called Murder Most Foul, in which Dylan revisits the assassination of JFK. \nRough and Rowdy Ways is more than a welcome addition to the ever-growing number of late works making up this new old-age pop star genre; it is exceptional. \nIf it were a painting, I'd call it a masterpiece. \nRough and Rowdy Ways: track listing\n1.

        "description": "The death of George Floyd has prompted one of the biggest movements against racism since the civil rights era.\nProtests were held globally after video footage from Minneapolis showed a white police officer kneeling on Mr Floyd's neck for almost nine minutes. \nThe 46-year-old could be heard repeatedly telling the officer, \"I can't breathe\".\nAround the world, music became a crucial way for people to express their grief and anger. \nBob Marley's Get Up, Stand Up and Bill Withers' Lean On Me soundtracked several protests, while streaming figures for songs that call out police violence soared: from Childish Gambino's This Is America and Kendrick Lamar's Alright to NWA's visceral hip-hop track [Expletive] Tha Police.\nThe latter was also used by hackers to disrupt police scanners in Chicago during the protests. \nIn a more unifying moment, protestors in Atlanta encouraged the National Guard to join them in performing the Macarena.\nAs the Black Lives Matter movement continues, the record industry has been paused to examine its own history of racial exclusion, and the inequity between black artists and the mainly white executives who profit from their work.\nMeanwhile, artists have channelled their frustration and anger into a new wave of protest songs, directly inspired by Mr Floyd's death and its aftermath.\nHere are some of the most striking examples - but please be aware that many of these songs contain explicit language.\nEnd of Youtube post  by Alicia Keys - Topic\nSung from the perspective of a mourning mother whose son has been shot to death, Alicia Keys' new single was released on Juneteenth - a holiday celebrating the emancipation of enslaved people in the US.\nIt was originally written in response to the deaths of Mike Brown and Sandra Bland, the former killed by police in Missouri in 2014, the latter who died in a jail cell in 2015 after Texas police stopped her for a minor traffic violation - but Keys said the message was \"never not going to be relevant\".\n\"Of course there is no perfect way to die,\" she wrote in an Instagram caption, as she premiered the song. \"This phrase doesn't even make sense but that's what makes the title so powerful and heartbreaking because so many have died unjustly. \n\"We all know none of these innocent lives should have been taken due to the culture of police violence.\"\nEnd of Youtube post  by HERMusicVEVO\n\"Just by the title, you know that it means something painful,\" said Grammy-nominated R&B artist H.E.R. as she debuted her new song in a living room concert.\n\"These lyrics were kind of easy to write because it came from a conversation of what's happening right now, what's been happening, and the change that we need to see,\" she said before her performance. \n\"I think music is powerful when it comes to change and when it comes to healing, and that's why I wrote this song, to make a mark in history.\"\nThe sombre, guitar-led song asks: \"What is a gun to a man that surrenders / What's it gonna take for someone to defend her / If we all agree that we're equal as people / Then why can't we see what's evil?\"\nH.E.R. said the track tackles the question that's been plaguing her over the last few weeks: Why is there so much hate?\n\"My favourite line in the song is, 'How do we cope when we don't love each other?'\" she told TMZ. \"I think we're all questioning that now.\"\nA post shared by LL COOL J (@llcoolj) on May 31, 2020 at 7:13pm PDT\nEnd of Instagram post  by llcoolj\nFrom the very first bar, you can tell LL Cool J won't be holding back.\n\"For 400 years you had your knees on our necks,\" he raps. \"A garden of evil with no seeds of respect\".\nThe 52-year-old goes on to ask what would have happened to former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin, had he not been filmed by bystanders during Mr Floyd's fatal arrest.\n\"Watching that man die slow left a hole,\" he says, \"If it wasn't for them phones, Chauvin would be at home / Feeling justified because of George skin tone / I'm telling those with melanin, you're not alone.\"\nEnd of Youtube post  by Dua Saleh\nMinneapolis artist Dua Saleh originally wrote Body Cast in response to the deaths of Jamar Clark and Philando Castile, who were fatally shot by police in separate incidents in 2015 and 2016.\n\"Unfortunately, I could have written the song at any point in my life and it would have been relevant, which is frightening to say the least,\" they told the Switched On Pop podcast.\nThe intro samples clips of Angela Whitehead, a woman from Montana who went viral last year when she rebuked two police officers for entering her home without a warrant or viable cause.\nSaleh later references the stand-off in her lyrics, singing: \"You must be crazy, coming up in here talking about you heard something /  You heard me talking, I talk loud and I'm aggressive and guess what? / You did not knock on my door.\"\n\"I just don't trust police officers in general,\" the singer said. \"I was just like disgusted at the thought that policing was a safe and viable option for black communities.\"\nProceeds from the song's download are being donated to the Minneapolis-based organisation, Black Visions Collective.\nEnd of Youtube post  by Denzel Curry\n\"Someone asked, how do I feel?\" Terrace Martin wrote, as he introduced his response to George Floyd's death. \n\"I told them hurt, fearless, angry, aware and fully ready to protect me, my family and my people at all cost. I got together with black men that felt the same way and created a work of truth.\"\nThe result is Pig Feet - a frenetic and urgent collision of jazz and hip-hop, where Kamasi Washington's fidgety saxophone emphasises lyrics about structural racism and police brutality.\nIt was first released on YouTube, accompanied by a video compiling clips from recent Black Lives Matter protests, followed by a list of victims of police violence that scroll silently up the screen.\n just singing what’s on my heart...hope this blesses someone🙏🏾❤️ @sdhtoronto thanks for this dope shirt!!🔥🔥 #ijustwantolive #blacklivesmatter #ijustwannalive #equality #black #blackexcellence #racism #justice @mstinalawson\nA post shared by  Keedron Bryant (@keedronbryant) on May 26, 2020 at 2:01pm PDT\nEnd of Instagram post  by keedronbryant\nTwelve-year-old Keedron Bryant gave voice to the feelings of thousands when he uploaded a simple, a capella performance of the original song I Just Wanna Live to Instagram three weeks ago.\n\"I'm a young black man / Doing all that I can / To stand, oh but when I look around / And I see what's being done to my kind/ Every day, I'm being hunted as prey,\" he sang, looking directly into the camera.\nHis performance, and the directness of the lyrics, written by his mother, won praise from Barack Obama, LeBron James, Janet Jackson and Katy Perry, who reposted the song to her followers with the message #BLACKLIVESMATTER.\nOn Friday, record label Warner Bros announced it had signed Keedron to a recording contract.\nFollow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

        "description": "Andrew Lloyd Webber is to conduct a series of tests at one of his theatres with the aim of showing the government that venues like it can reopen safely.\nThe 72-year-old said he wanted to trial measures that have enabled The Phantom of the Opera to reopen in South Korea.\nLord Lloyd-Webber said he hoped to test hygienic door handles, thermal imaging cameras and other measures at the London Palladium in early July.\n\"I really believe that we in theatre must be positive,\" he told the BBC.\n\"What I hope to do is to be able to demonstrate to the government what has happened in Korea,\" he said on BBC Radio 4's Today programme on Friday.\n\"The whole point is to try and make people feel as safe and secure as they possibly can.\"\nHe said Phantom had been able to continue in Seoul without the need for social distancing, which he called \"impossible in the theatre\".\nOther measures put in place to combat the coronavirus pandemic include a disinfectant \"fog\" that Lord Lloyd-Webber said had \"a 30-day life span\".\nThe theatre community, he continued, should \"use everything we can to demonstrate we can open. If having done that we fail, at least we've tried\".\nHis comments came after Phantom, Les Miserables and two other musicals were pulled from the West End for the rest of the year.\nProducer Sir Cameron Mackintosh attributed the \"heartbreaking\" decision to \"continued uncertainty\" over when the government will withdraw social distancing measures.\nOn Wednesday, Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden said he would bring \"leading performers\" together to develop a \"road map\" for performing safely.\nBut he admitted it would be \"exceptionally difficult\" for venues to reopen from 4 July - the current scheduled date for stage three of the government's reopening plan.\nThis week saw Phoebe Waller-Bridge, James McAvoy and other theatre notables call on the government to take action to prevent the sector from collapse.\nToby Jones, Andrew Scott and Sir Tom Stoppard also added their names to an open letter stating British theatre was \"on the brink of ruin\" and faced \"an existential threat\".\nFollow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

        "description": "Singer Alexandra Burke has spoken out about her experiences of racism in the music industry, revealing she was asked to bleach her skin \"to look whiter\".\nAfter winning X Factor, Burke said she was told she would \"have to work 10 times harder than a white artist, because of the colour of your skin\".\nIn a 15-minute Instagram video, she recalls being told: \"You can't have braids, you can't have an afro.\n\"You have to have hair... that appeals to white people.\"\nThe 31-year-old star, who won the TV talent show in 2008 at the age of 19, described the experiences as \"heartbreaking\".\nBurke, who refused to bleach her skin, said she was inspired to tell her story by fellow X Factor contestant Misha B, who recently spoke out about \"being devalued\" at the hands of the music industry.\nMisha B claimed the X Factor projected \"this angry black girl narrative\", using words such as \"feisty\" and \"bully\" to describe her after one a live performance on the show. The 2011 contestant said it left her feeling suicidal.\n\"I could have spoken up much earlier, but was too scared to,\" said Burke, whose Instagram post has attracted a lot of attention, and sympathy, on social media.\nThe music star revealed the micro-aggressions she experienced at the hands of record labels, being told regularly that she \"comes across aggressive\".\nShe said she was told: \"You can't release this kind of music, because white people don't understand that\", and added: \"I am so upset with myself that I allowed that.\" \nBurke, whose hit singles Hallelujah, Bad Boys and All Night Long were all nominated for Brit Awards, also played the lead in the critically acclaimed West End musical The Bodyguard.\nThe singer said was told: \"Because you're a black girl, you won't make it that far in the industry... if you were white, you would be bigger than what you are now, you could sell more records, you'd be a Brit Award-winner\".\n\"It's hurtful,\" she added.\nShe was raised in north London by her mother, Soul II Soul singer Melissa Bell, who died in August 2017 - just before Burke was due to take part in Strictly Come Dancing.\nShe recalled how one journalist accused her of \"being a diva\" when she asked not to do any publicity on the show's red carpet, which happened to be taking place on the same day as her mother died.\n\"That was the image they had of me, because of the papers.\" she said. \"I was so scared on that show. So many trolls, telling me all kinds of stuff. \n\"I have no idea how I got through it. I don't even like thinking about that experience. It's simply because of me being a black, strong woman. \n\"I can speak up for myself because that's how I've been taught. But I would never do it in a way that offends people or hurts anyone.\"\nShe said the Black Lives Matter movement had persuaded her to share her experiences because \"the truth is all we've got\".\n\"I just feel like people need to not see colour,\" said Burke. \"My mum always raised me to never see colour. I will continue that way because that's what makes me happy. \n\"People are people. We are all human, we all have feelings. So be kind.\"",

        "description": "Scottish author Irvine Welsh has addressed about 1,000 protesters at a Black Lives Matter demonstration in Edinburgh.\nThe Trainspotting writer criticised the statue of Henry Dundas, which stands at the top of the Melville Monument in St Andrew Square.\nThe 19th Century politician delayed the abolition of the slave trade.\nMr Welsh said it was like having a statue of shamed TV presenter Jimmy Saville on a plinth in a park.\nHe said of Dundas: \"Nobody did more to prevent the abolition of slavery.\n\"And make no mistake, they knew this was coming, that's why they put him so high.\n\"All this is, is a continuation, it goes right on to this day.\n\"The establishment have always protected the paedophiles in their midst.\n\"So imagine a statue of Sir Jimmy Savile, looking down at us with a cigar. Well this is Jimmy Savile times at least 100,000.\"\nJoseph Malik, organiser for Black Lives Matter event, said he was pleased Irvine Welsh had shown his support by coming to the event.\n\"What we want to achieve is to bring shame on Edinburgh for having a statue of a mass murderer,\" he said. \"I hope it is removed.\n\"Racism is still very much alive in Scotland and I was threatened online for coming here today.\n\"They also threatened my son which is despicable.\"\nThe monument is to be dedicated to those enslaved because of Dundas' actions.\nNew signage will explain that he was \"instrumental in deferring the abolition of the Atlantic slave trade\".\nDevon Singh, 27, from Edinburgh, said she thought there had been a good turnout at the protest.\n\"I came here today because this has gone on long enough and I wanted to make a stand and fight for what's right,\" she said.\nStephanie Dyer, 23, from Edinburgh, said: \"I want to take a stand and make my voice known.\n\"When I moved here from London I was called the N word and monkey, and strangers in the street pulled my hair because they were interested in it.\n\"There are hate crime laws in Scotland but it feels just like lip service as we face racism on a daily basis.\n\"I don't want platitudes, I want change.\"\nAislinn Prior, 29, who moved from London to Edinburgh two years ago, said: \"I'm here to take action and to show its not just a hashtag, I want to show solidarity and to make a change.\n\"I think schools need to teach a more accurate depiction of history in Scotland.\"\nNicole Watson, 25, from Edinburgh, said she had researched the history of Dundas when she heard about the protest.\nShe said: \"He was personally responsible for the prolonged slavery process for 15 years during which time 650,000 slaves were transported and traded in Scotland.\n\"I don't want him wiped from the history books but I don't want to overtly celebrate him.\"\nTJ Lamothe, 14, a pupil from Edinburgh Academy, said: \"I came here today to actively protest against racism.\n\"Racism is a real problem and being able to share my views and experiences can help educate others.\n\"When I was 10 years old I was in a supermarket and I had left my mum to walk around the shop and this person pushed bananas in my face and called me a monkey.\n\"I knew at the time that some people didn't like black people but it was my first experience of it and I didn't know what to do.\"",

        "title": "Rough but not Rowdy: Dylan's new album is a masterpiece ★★★★★",
        "description": "There is a new genre in pop music emerging. It's not coming from the housing estates of Tottenham, or the studios of LA. It hasn't stumbled out of the clubs of Ibiza, or drifted into mainstream from the back streets of Rio. It isn't radical or exciting or rebellious or loud. It is something else altogether: a form that has only just become possible, which is not down to technological progress, but the more mundane inevitability of the ageing process. \nThe baby-faced pop pioneers of yore; the beautiful young things who lit up a dreary post-war world, are coming to the end of their long and winding roads. It is an untrodden path. There are no precedents. It is up to those original trailblazers to define the aesthetics of an elderly star's final act. \nJohnny Cash set a tone with his Rick Rubin-produced American Recordings series, particularly American IV: The Man Comes Around (2002), which saw the Country legend take on contemporary pop. Stripped back and raw, his voice was less elastic and peppy, but had gained a richness and resonance that gave the songs a melancholic beauty.  \nBobby Womack went down a similar hip-collaboration route for his final album The Bravest Man in the Universe (2012), made with Blur's Damon Albarn and produced by Richard Russell. Womack's voice has the vintage wine vibe of Cash's, but this time it's the sound of '60s soul distilled through decades of hard living and regret. \nDavid Bowie's Blackstar (2016), released on his 69th birthday, two days before he died, consolidated the aesthetics of the late-career-pop-album just as Rembrandt's final paintings set the standard for an ageing artist's final flourish. It was nostalgic, prophetic, and philosophical.\nAs was Leonard Cohen's You Want it Darker, which came out later in the year.  \nWistfulness, wisdom, and vocal character rather than dynamic range, appear to be the dominant themes of this new category. \nThey are all there to be heard in Marianne Faithfull's Negative Capability (2018), in which she covers It's All Over Now, Baby Blue, written by her old friend Bob Dylan, the 2016 Nobel Laureate and most recent entrant to the ranks of the late career album brigade.\nRough and Rowdy Ways has all the hallmarks of the genre. It's not trying to impress or please. There's no obvious attempt to mask a weary, limited voice or occasionally garbled words. The pill isn't being sugared. What's the point? Nobody wants to hear sweet talk from of septuagenarian. \nTruth is the talisman, tell it like it is. \nAnd that is what Dylan does, starting with I Contain Multitudes, a folksy confessional about his nature and influences.\nWilliam Blake, The Rolling Stones, Anne Frank, Beethoven, Chopin and Indiana Jones are all name-checked in a lyrical story told in a musically simple song about a complex man, which opens with these words:\nToday, tomorrow, and yesterday, too\nThe flowers are dyin' like all things do\nLater, we get an early taste of his self-deprecating humour and constant cultural references (David Bowie in this instance) that are present throughout the album:\nOh, while I cannot frolic with all the young dudes\nI contain multitudes\nThe second track, False Prophet - a slow, bluesy number - has a heavier tone where Bob gets growly and Socratic, proclaiming he is an…\nEnemy of the unlived meaningless life\nI ain't no false prophet\nI just know what I know\nI go where only the lonely go \nI just don't know if he felt any pressure writing this album, the first he's penned since being announced a Nobel Laureate, but he is on top form. It's hard to produce a lyric nowadays that makes you listen in this multi-sensory, multi-media world of ours, but he succeeds time after time.\nMy Own Version of You, a low tempo, rockabilly-infused track sees the singer in the role of Victor Frankenstein; he's taking \"blood from a cactus, gunpowder from ice\", and \"going to bring someone to life in more ways than one\". It's a slippery, elliptical song that is at once a million miles from Blowin' in the Wind, while at the same time being so clearly from the same mind with its themes of identity and existence and time. All of which are revisited in track five, Black Rider, a quieter song with a Spanish guitar, which reflects on a life on the road. \nLike much of Rough and Rowdy Ways, it reminds me of Tom Waits's throatily-sung album called Black Rider (1993): not only the name but also the coarseness and urgency of Dylan's delivery. \nGoodbye Jimmy Reed is a storming 12-bar blues number, which is as close to classic Dylan as the album gets - there's even the squeal of a harmonica. It is also the most obviously autographical song, with a hint of old scores not yet settled:\nYou won't amount to much, the people said\n'Cause I didn't play guitar behind my head\nAgain, the writing is terrific.

        "description": "The death of George Floyd has prompted one of the biggest movements against racism since the civil rights era.\nProtests were held globally after video footage from Minneapolis showed a white police officer kneeling on Mr Floyd's neck for almost nine minutes. \nThe 46-year-old could be heard repeatedly telling the officer, \"I can't breathe\".\nAround the world, music became a crucial way for people to express their grief and anger. \nBob Marley's Get Up, Stand Up and Bill Withers' Lean On Me soundtracked several protests, while streaming figures for songs that call out police violence soared: from Childish Gambino's This Is America and Kendrick Lamar's Alright to NWA's visceral hip-hop track [Expletive] Tha Police.\nThe latter was also used by hackers to disrupt police scanners in Chicago during the protests. \nIn a more unifying moment, protestors in Atlanta encouraged the National Guard to join them in performing the Macarena.\nCountdown to curfew in Atlanta pic.twitter.com/vvITsNMSdB\nEnd of Twitter post  by @JennyJarvie\nAs the Black Lives Matter movement continues, the record industry has been paused to examine its own history of racial exclusion, and the inequity between black artists and the mainly white executives who profit from their work.\nMeanwhile, artists have channelled their frustration and anger into a new wave of protest songs, directly inspired by Mr Floyd's death and its aftermath.\nHere are some of the most striking examples - but please be aware that many of these songs contain explicit language.\nEnd of Youtube post  by Alicia Keys - Topic\nSung from the perspective of a mourning mother whose son has been shot to death, Alicia Keys' new single was released on Juneteenth - a holiday celebrating the emancipation of enslaved people in the US.\nIt was originally written in response to the deaths of Mike Brown and Sandra Bland, the former killed by police in Missouri in 2014, the latter who died in a jail cell in 2015 after Texas police stopped her for a minor traffic violation - but Keys said the message was \"never not going to be relevant\".\n\"Of course there is no perfect way to die,\" she wrote in an Instagram caption, as she premiered the song. \"This phrase doesn't even make sense but that's what makes the title so powerful and heartbreaking because so many have died unjustly. \n\"We all know none of these innocent lives should have been taken due to the culture of police violence.\"\nEnd of Youtube post  by HERMusicVEVO\n\"Just by the title, you know that it means something painful,\" said Grammy-nominated R&B artist H.E.R. as she debuted her new song in a living room concert.\n\"These lyrics were kind of easy to write because it came from a conversation of what's happening right now, what's been happening, and the change that we need to see,\" she said before her performance. \n\"I think music is powerful when it comes to change and when it comes to healing, and that's why I wrote this song, to make a mark in history.\"\nThe sombre, guitar-led song asks: \"What is a gun to a man that surrenders / What's it gonna take for someone to defend her / If we all agree that we're equal as people / Then why can't we see what's evil?\"\nH.E.R. said the track tackles the question that's been plaguing her over the last few weeks: Why is there so much hate?\n\"My favourite line in the song is, 'How do we cope when we don't love each other?'\" she told TMZ. \"I think we're all questioning that now.\"\nA post shared by LL COOL J (@llcoolj) on May 31, 2020 at 7:13pm PDT\nEnd of Instagram post  by llcoolj\nFrom the very first bar, you can tell LL Cool J won't be holding back.\n\"For 400 years you had your knees on our necks,\" he raps. \"A garden of evil with no seeds of respect\".\nThe 52-year-old goes on to ask what would have happened to former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin, had he not been filmed by bystanders during Mr Floyd's fatal arrest.\n\"Watching that man die slow left a hole,\" he says, \"If it wasn't for them phones, Chauvin would be at home / Feeling justified because of George skin tone / I'm telling those with melanin, you're not alone.\"\nEnd of Youtube post  by Dua Saleh\nMinneapolis artist Dua Saleh originally wrote Body Cast in response to the deaths of Jamar Clark and Philando Castile, who were fatally shot by police in separate incidents in 2015 and 2016.\n\"Unfortunately, I could have written the song at any point in my life and it would have been relevant, which is frightening to say the least,\" they told the Switched On Pop podcast.\nThe intro samples clips of Angela Whitehead, a woman from Montana who went viral last year when she rebuked two police officers for entering her home without a warrant or viable cause.\nSaleh later references the stand-off in her lyrics, singing: \"You must be crazy, coming up in here talking about you heard something /  You heard me talking, I talk loud and I'm aggressive and guess what? / You did not knock on my door.\"\n\"I just don't trust police officers in general,\" the singer said. \"I was just like disgusted at the thought that policing was a safe and viable option for black communities.\"\nProceeds from the song's download are being donated to the Minneapolis-based organisation, Black Visions Collective.\nEnd of Youtube post  by Denzel Curry\n\"Someone asked, how do I feel?\" Terrace Martin wrote, as he introduced his response to George Floyd's death. \n\"I told them hurt, fearless, angry, aware and fully ready to protect me, my family and my people at all cost. I got together with black men that felt the same way and created a work of truth.\"\nThe result is Pig Feet - a frenetic and urgent collision of jazz and hip-hop, where Kamasi Washington's fidgety saxophone emphasises lyrics about structural racism and police brutality.\nIt was first released on YouTube, accompanied by a video compiling clips from recent Black Lives Matter protests, followed by a list of victims of police violence that scroll silently up the screen.\n just singing what’s on my heart...hope this blesses someone🙏🏾❤️ @sdhtoronto thanks for this dope shirt!!🔥🔥 #ijustwantolive #blacklivesmatter #ijustwannalive #equality #black #blackexcellence #racism #justice @mstinalawson\nA post shared by  Keedron Bryant (@keedronbryant) on May 26, 2020 at 2:01pm PDT\nEnd of Instagram post  by keedronbryant\nTwelve-year-old Keedron Bryant gave voice to the feelings of thousands when he uploaded a simple, a capella performance of the original song I Just Wanna Live to Instagram three weeks ago.\n\"I'm a young black man / Doing all that I can / To stand, oh but when I look around / And I see what's being done to my kind/ Every day, I'm being hunted as prey,\" he sang, looking directly into the camera.\nHis performance, and the directness of the lyrics, written by his mother, won praise from Barack Obama, LeBron James, Janet Jackson and Katy Perry, who reposted the song to her followers with the message #BLACKLIVESMATTER.\nOn Friday, record label Warner Bros announced it had signed Keedron to a recording contract.\nFollow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

        "description": "Andrew Lloyd Webber is to conduct a series of tests at one of his theatres with the aim of showing the government that venues like it can reopen safely.\nThe 72-year-old said he wanted to trial measures that have enabled The Phantom of the Opera to reopen in South Korea.\nLord Lloyd-Webber said he hoped to test hygienic door handles, thermal imaging cameras and other measures at the London Palladium in early July.\n\"I really believe that we in theatre must be positive,\" he told the BBC.\n\"What I hope to do is to be able to demonstrate to the government what has happened in Korea,\" he said on BBC Radio 4's Today programme on Friday.\n\"The whole point is to try and make people feel as safe and secure as they possibly can.\"\nHe said Phantom had been able to continue in Seoul without the need for social distancing, which he called \"impossible in the theatre\".\nOther measures put in place to combat the coronavirus pandemic include a disinfectant \"fog\" that Lord Lloyd-Webber said had \"a 30-day life span\".\nThe theatre community, he continued, should \"use everything we can to demonstrate we can open. If having done that we fail, at least we've tried\".\nHis comments came after Phantom, Les Miserables and two other musicals were pulled from the West End for the rest of the year.\nProducer Sir Cameron Mackintosh attributed the \"heartbreaking\" decision to \"continued uncertainty\" over when the government will withdraw social distancing measures.\nOn Wednesday, Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden said he would bring \"leading performers\" together to develop a \"road map\" for performing safely.\nBut he admitted it would be \"exceptionally difficult\" for venues to reopen from 4 July - the current scheduled date for stage three of the government's reopening plan.\nThis week saw Phoebe Waller-Bridge, James McAvoy and other theatre notables call on the government to take action to prevent the sector from collapse.\nToby Jones, Andrew Scott and Sir Tom Stoppard also added their names to an open letter stating British theatre was \"on the brink of ruin\" and faced \"an existential threat\".\nFollow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

        "description": "Singer Alexandra Burke has spoken out about her experiences of racism in the music industry, revealing she was asked to bleach her skin \"to look whiter\".\nAfter winning X Factor, Burke said she was told she would \"have to work 10 times harder than a white artist, because of the colour of your skin\".\nIn a 15-minute Instagram video, she recalls being told: \"You can't have braids, you can't have an afro.\n\"You have to have hair... that appeals to white people.\"\nThe 31-year-old star, who won the TV talent show in 2008 at the age of 19, described the experiences as \"heartbreaking\".\nBurke, who refused to bleach her skin, said she was inspired to tell her story by fellow X Factor contestant Misha B, who recently spoke out about \"being devalued\" at the hands of the music industry.\nMisha B claimed the X Factor projected \"this angry black girl narrative\", using words such as \"feisty\" and \"bully\" to describe her after one a live performance on the show. The 2011 contestant said it left her feeling suicidal.\n\"I could have spoken up much earlier, but was too scared to,\" said Burke, whose Instagram post has attracted a lot of attention, and sympathy, on social media.\nThe music star revealed the micro-aggressions she experienced at the hands of record labels, being told regularly that she \"comes across aggressive\".\nShe said she was told: \"You can't release this kind of music, because white people don't understand that\", and added: \"I am so upset with myself that I allowed that.\" \nBurke, whose hit singles Hallelujah, Bad Boys and All Night Long were all nominated for Brit Awards, also played the lead in the critically acclaimed West End musical The Bodyguard.\nThe singer said was told: \"Because you're a black girl, you won't make it that far in the industry... if you were white, you would be bigger than what you are now, you could sell more records, you'd be a Brit Award-winner\".\n\"It's hurtful,\" she added.\nShe was raised in north London by her mother, Soul II Soul singer Melissa Bell, who died in August 2017 - just before Burke was due to take part in Strictly Come Dancing.\nShe recalled how one journalist accused her of \"being a diva\" when she asked not to do any publicity on the show's red carpet, which happened to be taking place on the same day as her mother died.\n\"That was the image they had of me, because of the papers.\" she said. \"I was so scared on that show. So many trolls, telling me all kinds of stuff. \n\"I have no idea how I got through it. I don't even like thinking about that experience. It's simply because of me being a black, strong woman. \n\"I can speak up for myself because that's how I've been taught. But I would never do it in a way that offends people or hurts anyone.\"\nShe said the Black Lives Matter movement had persuaded her to share her experiences because \"the truth is all we've got\".\n\"I just feel like people need to not see colour,\" said Burke. \"My mum always raised me to never see colour. I will continue that way because that's what makes me happy. \n\"People are people. We are all human, we all have feelings. So be kind.\"",

        "description": "Scottish author Irvine Welsh has addressed about 1,000 protesters at a Black Lives Matter demonstration in Edinburgh.\nThe Trainspotting writer criticised the statue of Henry Dundas, which stands at the top of the Melville Monument in St Andrew Square.\nThe 19th Century politician delayed the abolition of the slave trade.\nMr Welsh said it was like having a statue of shamed TV presenter Jimmy Saville on a plinth in a park.\nHe said of Dundas: \"Nobody did more to prevent the abolition of slavery.\n\"And make no mistake, they knew this was coming, that's why they put him so high.\n\"All this is, is a continuation, it goes right on to this day.\n\"The establishment have always protected the paedophiles in their midst.\n\"So imagine a statue of Sir Jimmy Savile, looking down at us with a cigar. Well this is Jimmy Savile times at least 100,000.\"\nJoseph Malik, organiser for Black Lives Matter event, said he was pleased Irvine Welsh had shown his support by coming to the event.\n\"What we want to achieve is to bring shame on Edinburgh for having a statue of a mass murderer,\" he said. \"I hope it is removed.\n\"Racism is still very much alive in Scotland and I was threatened online for coming here today.\n\"They also threatened my son which is despicable.\"\nThe monument is to be dedicated to those enslaved because of Dundas' actions.\nNew signage will explain that he was \"instrumental in deferring the abolition of the Atlantic slave trade\".\nDevon Singh, 27, from Edinburgh, said she thought there had been a good turnout at the protest.\n\"I came here today because this has gone on long enough and I wanted to make a stand and fight for what's right,\" she said.\nStephanie Dyer, 23, from Edinburgh, said: \"I want to take a stand and make my voice known.\n\"When I moved here from London I was called the N word and monkey, and strangers in the street pulled my hair because they were interested in it.\n\"There are hate crime laws in Scotland but it feels just like lip service as we face racism on a daily basis.\n\"I don't want platitudes, I want change.\"\nAislinn Prior, 29, who moved from London to Edinburgh two years ago, said: \"I'm here to take action and to show its not just a hashtag, I want to show solidarity and to make a change.\n\"I think schools need to teach a more accurate depiction of history in Scotland.\"\nNicole Watson, 25, from Edinburgh, said she had researched the history of Dundas when she heard about the protest.\nShe said: \"He was personally responsible for the prolonged slavery process for 15 years during which time 650,000 slaves were transported and traded in Scotland.\n\"I don't want him wiped from the history books but I don't want to overtly celebrate him.\"\nTJ Lamothe, 14, a pupil from Edinburgh Academy, said: \"I came here today to actively protest against racism.\n\"Racism is a real problem and being able to share my views and experiences can help educate others.\n\"When I was 10 years old I was in a supermarket and I had left my mum to walk around the shop and this person pushed bananas in my face and called me a monkey.\n\"I knew at the time that some people didn't like black people but it was my first experience of it and I didn't know what to do.\"",

        "title": "Rough but not Rowdy: Dylan's new album is a masterpiece ★★★★★",
        "description": "There is a new genre in pop music emerging. It's not coming from the housing estates of Tottenham, or the studios of LA. It hasn't stumbled out of the clubs of Ibiza, or drifted into mainstream from the back streets of Rio. It isn't radical or exciting or rebellious or loud. It is something else altogether: a form that has only just become possible, which is not down to technological progress, but the more mundane inevitability of the ageing process. \nThe baby-faced pop pioneers of yore; the beautiful young things who lit up a dreary post-war world, are coming to the end of their long and winding roads. It is an untrodden path. There are no precedents. It is up to those original trailblazers to define the aesthetics of an elderly star's final act. \nJohnny Cash set a tone with his Rick Rubin-produced American Recordings series, particularly American IV: The Man Comes Around (2002), which saw the Country legend take on contemporary pop. Stripped back and raw, his voice was less elastic and peppy, but had gained a richness and resonance that gave the songs a melancholic beauty.  \nBobby Womack went down a similar hip-collaboration route for his final album The Bravest Man in the Universe (2012), made with Blur's Damon Albarn and produced by Richard Russell. Womack's voice has the vintage wine vibe of Cash's, but this time it's the sound of '60s soul distilled through decades of hard living and regret. \nDavid Bowie's Blackstar (2016), released on his 69th birthday, two days before he died, consolidated the aesthetics of the late-career-pop-album just as Rembrandt's final paintings set the standard for an ageing artist's final flourish. It was nostalgic, prophetic, and philosophical.\nAs was Leonard Cohen's You Want it Darker, which came out later in the year.  \nWistfulness, wisdom, and vocal character rather than dynamic range, appear to be the dominant themes of this new category. \nThey are all there to be heard in Marianne Faithfull's Negative Capability (2018), in which she covers It's All Over Now, Baby Blue, written by her old friend Bob Dylan, the 2016 Nobel Laureate and most recent entrant to the ranks of the late career album brigade.\nRough and Rowdy Ways has all the hallmarks of the genre. It's not trying to impress or please. There's no obvious attempt to mask a weary, limited voice or occasionally garbled words. The pill isn't being sugared. What's the point? Nobody wants to hear sweet talk from of septuagenarian. \nTruth is the talisman, tell it like it is. \nAnd that is what Dylan does, starting with I Contain Multitudes, a folksy confessional about his nature and influences.\nWilliam Blake, The Rolling Stones, Anne Frank, Beethoven, Chopin and Indiana Jones are all name-checked in a lyrical story told in a musically simple song about a complex man, which opens with these words:\nToday, tomorrow, and yesterday, too\nThe flowers are dyin' like all things do\nLater, we get an early taste of his self-deprecating humour and constant cultural references (David Bowie in this instance) that are present throughout the album:\nOh, while I cannot frolic with all the young dudes\nI contain multitudes\nThe second track, False Prophet - a slow, bluesy number - has a heavier tone where Bob gets growly and Socratic, proclaiming he is an…\nEnemy of the unlived meaningless life\nI ain't no false prophet\nI just know what I know\nI go where only the lonely go \nI just don't know if he felt any pressure writing this album, the first he's penned since being announced a Nobel Laureate, but he is on top form. It's hard to produce a lyric nowadays that makes you listen in this multi-sensory, multi-media world of ours, but he succeeds time after time.\nMy Own Version of You, a low tempo, rockabilly-infused track sees the singer in the role of Victor Frankenstein; he's taking \"blood from a cactus, gunpowder from ice\", and \"going to bring someone to life in more ways than one\". It's a slippery, elliptical song that is at once a million miles from Blowin' in the Wind, while at the same time being so clearly from the same mind with its themes of identity and existence and time. All of which are revisited in track five, Black Rider, a quieter song with a Spanish guitar, which reflects on a life on the road. \nLike much of Rough and Rowdy Ways, it reminds me of Tom Waits's throatily-sung album called Black Rider (1993): not only the name but also the coarseness and urgency of Dylan's delivery. \nGoodbye Jimmy Reed is a storming 12-bar blues number, which is as close to classic Dylan as the album gets - there's even the squeal of a harmonica. It is also the most obviously autographical song, with a hint of old scores not yet settled:\nYou won't amount to much, the people said\n'Cause I didn't play guitar behind my head\nAgain, the writing is terrific. For my money Leonard Cohen was the better poet of the two folksters, but the Canadian didn't have Dylan's cantankerous edge, which leads to unforgettable lines such as this from Goodbye Jimmy Reed:\nI need you like my head needs a noose \nThe atmosphere changes markedly in Mother of Muses, a hymn-like lament that is quite simply beautiful, made more so as Dylan struggles for the high notes: a regal voice of pop facing up to his fading faculties like King Lear. It's a deeply romantic piece: an ode to America with a Walt Whitman quality, in which our protagonist tells us he is falling in love with Calliope (the Greek muse of epic poetry).\nMother of Muses, wherever you are\nI've already outlived my life by far\nThe album finishes with three increasingly long songs, ending with a 16-minute disc 2, a previously released track called Murder Most Foul, in which Dylan revisits the assassination of JFK. \nRough and Rowdy Ways is more than a welcome addition to the ever-growing number of late works making up this new old-age pop star genre; it is exceptional. \nIf it were a painting, I'd call it a masterpiece. \nRough and Rowdy Ways: track listing\n1.

        "description": "The death of George Floyd has prompted one of the biggest movements against racism since the civil rights era.\nProtests were held globally after video footage from Minneapolis showed a white police officer kneeling on Mr Floyd's neck for almost nine minutes. \nThe 46-year-old could be heard repeatedly telling the officer, \"I can't breathe\".\nAround the world, music became a crucial way for people to express their grief and anger. \nBob Marley's Get Up, Stand Up and Bill Withers' Lean On Me soundtracked several protests, while streaming figures for songs that call out police violence soared: from Childish Gambino's This Is America and Kendrick Lamar's Alright to NWA's visceral hip-hop track [Expletive] Tha Police.\nThe latter was also used by hackers to disrupt police scanners in Chicago during the protests. \nIn a more unifying moment, protestors in Atlanta encouraged the National Guard to join them in performing the Macarena.\nCountdown to curfew in Atlanta pic.twitter.com/vvITsNMSdB\nEnd of Twitter post  by @JennyJarvie\nAs the Black Lives Matter movement continues, the record industry has been paused to examine its own history of racial exclusion, and the inequity between black artists and the mainly white executives who profit from their work.\nMeanwhile, artists have channelled their frustration and anger into a new wave of protest songs, directly inspired by Mr Floyd's death and its aftermath.\nHere are some of the most striking examples - but please be aware that many of these songs contain explicit language.\nEnd of Youtube post  by Alicia Keys - Topic\nSung from the perspective of a mourning mother whose son has been shot to death, Alicia Keys' new single was released on Juneteenth - a holiday celebrating the emancipation of enslaved people in the US.\nIt was originally written in response to the deaths of Mike Brown and Sandra Bland, the former killed by police in Missouri in 2014, the latter who died in a jail cell in 2015 after Texas police stopped her for a minor traffic violation - but Keys said the message was \"never not going to be relevant\".\n\"Of course there is no perfect way to die,\" she wrote in an Instagram caption, as she premiered the song. \"This phrase doesn't even make sense but that's what makes the title so powerful and heartbreaking because so many have died unjustly. \n\"We all know none of these innocent lives should have been taken due to the culture of police violence.\"\nEnd of Youtube post  by HERMusicVEVO\n\"Just by the title, you know that it means something painful,\" said Grammy-nominated R&B artist H.E.R. as she debuted her new song in a living room concert.\n\"These lyrics were kind of easy to write because it came from a conversation of what's happening right now, what's been happening, and the change that we need to see,\" she said before her performance. \n\"I think music is powerful when it comes to change and when it comes to healing, and that's why I wrote this song, to make a mark in history.\"\nThe sombre, guitar-led song asks: \"What is a gun to a man that surrenders / What's it gonna take for someone to defend her / If we all agree that we're equal as people / Then why can't we see what's evil?\"\nH.E.R. said the track tackles the question that's been plaguing her over the last few weeks: Why is there so much hate?\n\"My favourite line in the song is, 'How do we cope when we don't love each other?'\" she told TMZ. \"I think we're all questioning that now.\"\nA post shared by LL COOL J (@llcoolj) on May 31, 2020 at 7:13pm PDT\nEnd of Instagram post  by llcoolj\nFrom the very first bar, you can tell LL Cool J won't be holding back.\n\"For 400 years you had your knees on our necks,\" he raps. \"A garden of evil with no seeds of respect\".\nThe 52-year-old goes on to ask what would have happened to former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin, had he not been filmed by bystanders during Mr Floyd's fatal arrest.\n\"Watching that man die slow left a hole,\" he says, \"If it wasn't for them phones, Chauvin would be at home / Feeling justified because of George skin tone / I'm telling those with melanin, you're not alone.\"\nEnd of Youtube post  by Dua Saleh\nMinneapolis artist Dua Saleh originally wrote Body Cast in response to the deaths of Jamar Clark and Philando Castile, who were fatally shot by police in separate incidents in 2015 and 2016.\n\"Unfortunately, I could have written the song at any point in my life and it would have been relevant, which is frightening to say the least,\" they told the Switched On Pop podcast.\nThe intro samples clips of Angela Whitehead, a woman from Montana who went viral last year when she rebuked two police officers for entering her home without a warrant or viable cause.\nSaleh later references the stand-off in her lyrics, singing: \"You must be crazy, coming up in here talking about you heard something /  You heard me talking, I talk loud and I'm aggressive and guess what? / You did not knock on my door.\"\n\"I just don't trust police officers in general,\" the singer said. \"I was just like disgusted at the thought that policing was a safe and viable option for black communities.\"\nProceeds from the song's download are being donated to the Minneapolis-based organisation, Black Visions Collective.\nEnd of Youtube post  by Denzel Curry\n\"Someone asked, how do I feel?\" Terrace Martin wrote, as he introduced his response to George Floyd's death. \n\"I told them hurt, fearless, angry, aware and fully ready to protect me, my family and my people at all cost. I got together with black men that felt the same way and created a work of truth.\"\nThe result is Pig Feet - a frenetic and urgent collision of jazz and hip-hop, where Kamasi Washington's fidgety saxophone emphasises lyrics about structural racism and police brutality.\nIt was first released on YouTube, accompanied by a video compiling clips from recent Black Lives Matter protests, followed by a list of victims of police violence that scroll silently up the screen.\n just singing what’s on my heart...hope this blesses someone🙏🏾❤️ @sdhtoronto thanks for this dope shirt!!🔥🔥 #ijustwantolive #blacklivesmatter #ijustwannalive #equality #black #blackexcellence #racism #justice @mstinalawson\nA post shared by  Keedron Bryant (@keedronbryant) on May 26, 2020 at 2:01pm PDT\nEnd of Instagram post  by keedronbryant\nTwelve-year-old Keedron Bryant gave voice to the feelings of thousands when he uploaded a simple, a capella performance of the original song I Just Wanna Live to Instagram three weeks ago.\n\"I'm a young black man / Doing all that I can / To stand, oh but when I look around / And I see what's being done to my kind/ Every day, I'm being hunted as prey,\" he sang, looking directly into the camera.\nHis performance, and the directness of the lyrics, written by his mother, won praise from Barack Obama, LeBron James, Janet Jackson and Katy Perry, who reposted the song to her followers with the message #BLACKLIVESMATTER.\nOn Friday, record label Warner Bros announced it had signed Keedron to a recording contract.\nFollow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

        "title": "Andrew Lloyd Webber 'wants to prove theatres can reopen'",
        "description": "Andrew Lloyd Webber is to conduct a series of tests at one of his theatres with the aim of showing the government that venues like it can reopen safely.\nThe 72-year-old said he wanted to trial measures that have enabled The Phantom of the Opera to reopen in South Korea.\nLord Lloyd-Webber said he hoped to test hygienic door handles, thermal imaging cameras and other measures at the London Palladium in early July.\n\"I really believe that we in theatre must be positive,\" he told the BBC.\n\"What I hope to do is to be able to demonstrate to the government what has happened in Korea,\" he said on BBC Radio 4's Today programme on Friday.\n\"The whole point is to try and make people feel as safe and secure as they possibly can.\"\nHe said Phantom had been able to continue in Seoul without the need for social distancing, which he called \"impossible in the theatre\".\nOther measures put in place to combat the coronavirus pandemic include a disinfectant \"fog\" that Lord Lloyd-Webber said had \"a 30-day life span\".\nThe theatre community, he continued, should \"use everything we can to demonstrate we can open. If having done that we fail, at least we've tried\".\nHis comments came after Phantom, Les Miserables and two other musicals were pulled from the West End for the rest of the year.\nProducer Sir Cameron Mackintosh attributed the \"heartbreaking\" decision to \"continued uncertainty\" over when the government will withdraw social distancing measures.\nOn Wednesday, Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden said he would bring \"leading performers\" together to develop a \"road map\" for performing safely.\nBut he admitted it would be \"exceptionally difficult\" for venues to reopen from 4 July - the current scheduled date for stage three of the government's reopening plan.\nThis week saw Phoebe Waller-Bridge, James McAvoy and other theatre notables call on the government to take action to prevent the sector from collapse.\nToby Jones, Andrew Scott and Sir Tom Stoppard also added their names to an open letter stating British theatre was \"on the brink of ruin\" and faced \"an existential threat\".\nFollow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

        "title": "Obituary: Ian Holm",
        "description": " Sir Ian Holm was the consummate supporting actor, happy to let others bask in the limelight of stardom.\nHe built his career in the theatre with the Royal Shakespeare Company, later wowing critics in Richard Eyre's National Theatre production of King Lear, and electrified audiences in Harold Pinter's The Homecoming.\nHis move into cinema saw him playing a variety of supporting roles including an android in Alien, the professional coach in Chariots of Fire and Dr Willis in The Madness of King George.\nAnd he achieved international fame as Bilbo Baggins in Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings trilogy.\nIan Holm Cuthbert was born on 12 September 1931 in a psychiatric hospital in Goodmayes, Essex, where his father, a psychiatrist and a pioneer of electric shock treatment, was the superintendent. His mother was a nurse.\nHe suffered from anxiety as a child and was bullied at his private school, where he took refuge in a love of drama. A chance meeting with the noted actor-manager Henry Baynton saw him enrolled at Rada in 1949.\nHis studies were cut short by National Service, most of which he spent in Germany with the British army. He eventually returned to Rada and graduated in 1953.\nHe secured a job with the Royal Shakespeare Company at Stratford, where his first recorded role was as a spear carrier in a 1954 production of Othello. He also played Mutius in a production of Titus Andronicus that toured Europe in 1956.\nOver the ensuing years he moved further up the cast list with roles that included Donalbain in Macbeth, The Fool in King Lear and Puck in A Midsummer Night's Dream. \nHe established a reputation as a talented and reliable actor - so much so that by the mid-1960s he was playing meatier parts, including the title roles in Henry V and Richard III. \nHolm stepped away from the works of the Bard to take the role of Lenny in both the London and New York premieres of Harold Pinter's play The Homecoming. Appearing in the latter won him a Tony award. \nHe made his first foray into cinema in John Frankenheimer's film of The Fixer, based on a true story of a Jew falsely accused of murder in Tsarist Russia. It was just one of more than 90 films in which he would appear. \nHolm became the master of the sound, supporting performance in a variety of roles. During the 1970s these included David Riccio in Mary, Queen of Scots and Yakovlev in Nicholas and Alexandra.\nIn 1973 he reprised the role of Lenny in the film version of The Homecoming.\nFor a time he had parallel careers in both theatre and cinema. But he had a history of depression and was finding stage appearances more difficult.\n\"The crack-up\", as he later termed it, came during a 1976 production of The Iceman Cometh, when a sudden attack of stage fright forced him to stop performing.  \n Apart from two brief appearances, one as Uncle Vanya in 1979, he did not return to the stage for 18 years. \nBut his career was rescued by his TV and film work and the awards started to come. His role as Peter Pan author J M Barrie in the BBC's production of The Lost Boys won him a Royal Television Society award and a Bafta nomination.\nIn 1979 he made his first big Hollywood appearance, as the android Ash in Alien. \"It wasn't a particularly pleasant film to do,\" he later recalled. \"It was 16 weeks of bloody hard work down at Shepperton Studios.\"\nTwo years later he appeared as Sam Mussabini in Hugh Hudson's film Chariots of Fire, based on the story of the athletes Eric Liddell and Harold Abrahams as they prepared for the 1924 Olympics.\nHis performance as the professional coach, shunned by the authorities in an age of amateurism, won him a Bafta for best supporting actor as well as an Oscar nomination. \nIn the same year he took the part of Frodo Baggins in BBC Radio 4's massive adaptation of The Lord of the Rings, which featured Holm alongside a host of other stars including Michael Hordern and Robert Stephens. \nHe continued to receive critical praise for his film roles, notably in Time Bandits (1981), Brazil (1985) and a performance as Lewis Carroll in Dreamchild, Dennis Potter's fantasy based on the life of Alice Liddell.\nAnd the awards continued, including a Bafta for the Granada TV series Game, Set & Match, based on Len Deighton's spy trilogy.\nHolm never lost his fascination with Shakespeare. He took the role of Fluellen in Kenneth Branagh's highly acclaimed 1989 film of Henry V and, a year later, played Polonius alongside Mel Gibson as Hamlet in Franco Zeffirelli's film of the play.\nHe was eventually lured back to the stage in 1993 to star in the premiere of Harold Pinter's Moonlight. Pinter was said to have described Holm as his favourite performer, \"an actor of total integrity\".\nHe continued to demonstrate his versatility in a wide range of roles, from Pod Clock in the BBC children's series The Borrowers to Kenneth Branagh's father in Mary Shelley's Frankenstein.\nHis performance as Dr Willis, the physician who treated George III in The Madness of King George, garnered yet another Bafta nomination.\nThere were further nominations and awards for his portrayal of lawyer Michael Stephens in critically acclaimed Canadian film The Sweet Hereafter. Back on stage he won an Olivier for his King Lear in 1998, the year in which he received a knighthood.\nIn 2001 he took what was probably his highest-profile role, that of the hobbit Bilbo Baggins in Peter Jackson's epic production of the Lord of the Rings trilogy.\nIn the same year he once again appeared in a production of Pinter's The Homecoming, this time as Max, the father of his previous character Lenny.\nThe critic Charles Spencer said his performance captured \"both the rage and the vulnerability of a life-long bully who is appalled to discover that his word is no longer writ\".\nIn 2012, at the age of 81, he reprised the role of Bilbo Baggins in Peter Jackson's film trilogy based on The Hobbit. \nAway from stage and screen he was much sought-after as a narrator, notably on the BBC documentary Elizabeth R and for voiceover work in commercials and video games.\nHolm married Lynn Shaw in 1955, a union that lasted for 10 years. His four-year marriage to Sophie Baker ended in divorce in 1986 and, five years later, he married the actress Penelope Wilton.\nThe couple divorced in 2001 and he subsequently married Sophie de Stempel in 2003.\nIan Holm was once asked how he felt about being so often the supporting actor, rarely the star. \"As an actor,\" he replied, \"I'm very much a company person.\n\"I have a dread of responsibility. I like someone else to be in charge.\"",

        "title": "New US awards celebrate black theatre talent",
        "description": "Covid-19 means the 2020 Tony Awards - New York's annual celebration of Broadway theatre - are on hold. But the first Antonyo Awards are happening later.\nThe idea is to recognise the best of African American theatrical talent, which the organisers say doesn't always get its due.\nDarius Barnes is a Broadway dancer and choreographer who until March was in the Tina Fey musical Mean Girls. He's already working on the new Michael Jackson show MJ, now scheduled to hit Broadway next year.\nHe could have found time hanging heavy after the coronavirus pandemic closed all New York theatres on 12 March. Instead, he's one of a group of ambitious African American theatre practitioners pulling together the inaugural Antonyo Awards.\nHe says the awards, whose name is a riff on the long-established Tonys, are a celebration of black theatre talent and blackness in general. \"We wanted to do something to uplift the black theatre community and the contribution it's made to Broadway and off-Broadway theatre,\" he says.\nBarnes says it's just chance that the Antonyos are launching in the year of Covid-19. \n\"But I think actually they might have been harder to get started in normal times - everyone in New York theatre is always crazy busy.\n\"But now everyone's at home working through Zoom or whatever and they had a little more time to donate their talent and record material for this week's show. I don't know if a live red carpet event would ever have happened this quickly.\"\nThe ceremony is online on Friday, 19 June - or \"Juneteenth\", the anniversary of the end of slavery in 1865. \nPresenters will include Audra McDonald, one of Broadway's most acclaimed stars, and Titus Burgess of the Netflix series Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt. \nAround 8,000 people voted online for theatre talent shortlisted in almost 30 categories. Some are the performance categories you would expect, such as best actor in a play. \nBut executive producer Drew Shade says it's equally important to look at black talent in less glamorous areas such as best lighting design and best sound.\n\"There's a huge gap in the representation of people of colour in categories like scenic design, both on Broadway and off Broadway,\" he says. \"That's definitely one of the things we are highlighting.\"\n(The term off-Broadway usually refers to Manhattan theatres that hold between 100 and 499 people.)\nShade also runs the website BroadwayBlack.com. He says around 50 shows in the last Broadway season (until terminated by Covid-19) featured African American talent, on stage or off. \n\"Given how many shows there can be in New York, that's not a massive number. So where are all the black orchestrators for instance? That's a major job in Broadway theatre.\"\nSo are the Antonyo Awards intended to be a criticism of the the Tonys, which have existed since 1947 and are broadcast live on network television each year?\nSince 2000, there have been just four black winners of the Tony for best actress in a play. Denzel Washington is the only black actor to have taken the equivalent male award in the same period.\n\"I don't call it criticism,\" says Shade. \"It's more that we're shining a light on what the situation is. Instead of trying to shame people, we thought, let's just do something ourselves now. \n\"We know certain things about society and how people want to be treated. We know what feels right and what's morally right.\"\nThe Antonyos are of course also happening as the Black Lives Matter movement is news around the world. \n\"Black Lives Matter has been a part of our culture for several years since Trayvon Martin's death [in 2012] - the culture of our bodies not being valued,\" Shade says.\n\"I don't want to ride on the back of a movement which is so much more than what I am doing.\n\"But we are doing the work to make sure we are uplifting each other. I am happy that the awards are starting when people actually need this joy right now.\"\nThe Antonyo Awards can be watched on YouTube at 19:00 EST (midnight BST) on Friday.\nFollow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

        "title": "Suspended Hollywood movies resume production",
        "description": "While lockdown may have provided us with the chance to catch up on some old movies, there's only so many you can watch before you crave something new.\nAgreed? Agreed.\nWell, fear not, because around the world some of the big-hitters are starting to re-commence production - which was of course halted by Covid-19 - in a variety of socially-distanced ways.\nHere are just six of the films to keep your fingers crossed for then in 2021, when the cinemas are hopefully back in business.\nThe long-awaited sequel to James Cameron's 2009 sci-fi blockbuster was able to re-start filming in New Zealand this week, because the country is almost coronavirus free.\nCameron and producer Jon Landau told the press Down Under that part two of the planned five-part film series; rumoured to be called The Way of Water (oh yeah, it's set under water this time, by the way) would bring hundreds of jobs and millions of dollars back into the country following the pandemic.\nLaundau shared a photo on Instagram earlier this week as the production got under way.\n Used my iPhone to snap a picture of our first shot back in production on the Avatar sequels.\nA post shared by  Jon Landau (@jonplandau) on Jun 15, 2020 at 5:04pm PDT\nEnd of Instagram post  by jonplandau\nIt will also bring some more big names including Kate Winslet and Vin Diesel to add to returning original stars Zoe Saldana, Sigourney Weaver and Sam Worthington.\nAvatar 2, which is intended to work as a standalone feature (you won't need to have seen the first one, in other words), will focus on the children of Sully and Neytiri, who are by now leaders of their clan.\nThe film is now slated for a December 2021 release, with film five in the diary already for 2027 - for those of you who like to plan ahead.\nIf you thought reaching five films was impressive, the sixth film in the dinosaur movie franchise will be the first big production to resume in the UK next month, following rigorous new safety protocols on-set.\n(It's always best to stay at least two metres away from a dinosaur, or so we've read.)\n\"Cost isn't our main concern now: it's safety,\" Universal bosses recently told Deadline., about its reported $5m (£4m) safety plan, which includes on-site doctors and 150 hand sanitiser stations being added to Pinewood Studios in London.\nStars Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard are reportedly due to arrive back in London any day now, where they will have to self-isolate for two-weeks.\nWhich should give them the opportunity to revise the original Jurassic Park film, before Sam Neill, Laura Dern and Jeff Goldblum all join them to reprise their roles as giant lizard-chasing academics for a final time.\nAll being well, the results should be with us in June 2021.\nBack Down Under, but this time in Australia, director Baz Luhrmann's Elvis Presley biopic is expected to restart soon too.\nFilming came to a halt after star Tom Hanks, and his wife, the actor Rita Wilson, tested positive for Covid-19, but both later recovered.\nThe currently-untitled movie will see Hanks portray Presley's long-standing and famously tough manager, Colonel Tom Parker. Austin Butler will play the young king of rock 'n' roll.\nQueensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk confirmed in a press conference on Wednesday that filming on the country's Gold Coast would commence: \"as soon as possible while making sure that the cast and crew can operate safely\".\nThis film was always on our minds throughout lockdown and will hopefully be on our big screens by November 2021.\nThe latest in a long line of delays and difficulties for the Tom Cruise-starring spy action thriller occurred in late February in Italy, which was decimated by the virus early on.\nFilming was then moved back to the UK before being halted altogether. \nHowever, first assistant director Tommy Gormley told BBC Radio 4's Today programme this month that they hoped to go again from September and to still \"visit all the countries we planned to\".\nActor Simon Pegg, who plays Benji Dunn in the franchise, told Variety it will \"begin with the outdoor stuff\", which he said \"feels fairly doable\".\nThe producers' mission now, which they appear to have accepted, is to get the film in the cinemas for November 2021.\nDisney's live-action remake of the classic animation, starring Halle Bailey and Melissa McCarthy, had to cancel its London filming plans just a week before it was due to start in March.\nBailey, who went home to isolate in Los Angeles, has said she's \"very excited\" about the prospect of filming again.\nShe told Entertainment Tonight: \"I was in London at the beginning of the year about to start filming and of course this pandemic caused everyone to slow down.\n\"I actually welcomed it because I was really missing my sister who was here in LA, so I was happy to get back to her and I'm just so very excited for when we start back again.\n\"It's just really coming together. I just feel honoured every day to even think about it or talk about, I'm like, 'What the heck? That's really happening?'\"\nThe film never did have a confirmed release date, even before the pandemic, although Digital Spy pointed out that an unnamed Disney live-action movie is pencilled in for release on November 19, 2021.\nFinally, from fish to winged creatures... \nFilming for the new Batman movie initially began in Glasgow in February with the caped crusader seen riding a motorbike in the city. However, it is thought the man seen in a Batman costume was a stuntman, rather than the film's star Robert Pattinson.\nPattinson replaced Ben Affleck, after he hung up his cape, and the lengthy filming delay gave him chance to work on his fitness regime for the role.\nIt's probably not dissimilar to your own lockdown workout. As the the US actor told Healthy For Men magazine, it involved cutting back on alcohol, and running \"5-10km, three to four times per week\" as well as \"bicycle crunches, dumbbell side bends, double crunches, and more\".\nHe'll star opposite Zoe Kravitz, who'll play the hero's complex love interest Catwoman.\nThe film is due out in October 2021, when we'll hopefully get to discover how that inter-species relationship blossoms.\nFollow us on Facebook or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

        "title": "We'll Meet Again: The story of Vera Lynn's wartime classic",
        "description": "We'll Meet Again became Dame Vera Lynn's signature song. It was also one of the first singles to use a synth, was accused of being too \"slushy\" for the troops, and has featured in Dr Strangelove and Stranger Things. \nNo song captured the heartbreak and optimism of Britain at war better than We'll Meet Again.\nRecorded in 1939 by Vera Lynn, who has died at the age of 103, its lyrics provided comfort to all those who were apart from their loved ones.\n\"We'll met again, don't know where, don't know when / But I know we'll meet again, some sunny day.\"\nThe song has since been quoted by the Queen and covered by Johnny Cash. It even entered the UK chart earlier this year, offering a message of hope during the coronavirus lockdown.\n\"Its lyric seemed to me to be a perfect example of what you might call the 'greetings card song,'\" Dame Vera wrote in her 1975 autobiography Vocal Refrain.  \n\"A very basic human message of the sort that people want to say to each other but find embarrassing actually to put into words.\"\nEnd of Youtube post  by Music Video Vault\nThe singer was only 22 when she first recorded the song. It was in the first year of the conflict - during the so-called \"phoney war\", when troops were conscripted but very little fighting took place - that Lynn found the song while shopping around music publishing companies in London's Denmark Street for new material.\nOne of the leading lights at the time was Hughie Charles, who had turned down the opportunity to open the batting for Lancashire County Cricket Club to seek his fortune as a composer.\nHaving appraised Lynn as \"a very nice kid\", he encouraged her to record two patriotic songs he'd written with Ross Parker in anticipation of the coming hostilities - the strident, optimistic There'll Always Be An England and the more wistful We'll Meet Again.\nShe first performed We'll Meet Again in the summer with Bert Ambrose and his orchestra. \"Looking back on the reviews, I notice the newspapers picked up on it right away,\" she told The Guardian in 1995. \n\"It was the perfect song to sign off with, and I started to use it more and more.\" \nWith a melody loosely based on Anton Rubinstein's Melody in F, it was the singer's performance that touched people's hearts - her characteristically low tone and emotional delivery chiming with the prevailing mood of the times.\nHer first recording of the song took place later that year, accompanied by Arthur Young on a new instrument called the Hammond Novachord, the world's first commercially-available polyphonic synthesizer.\nThe \"instrument that reproduces the tone of a dozen instruments\" had only made its debut at the New York World Fair that April, making Lynn's single one of the first pop records (perhaps the very first) to feature a synth.\nHowever it was a later recording, backed by a full orchestra, that became more famous.\nBy that time, she had become a fixture on forces' radio with her programme Sincerely Yours. \nMore than 20% of the British public tuned in to the show every Sunday night, as Lynn performed songs of hope amid hardship and read out letters from people separated by the war.\n\"Although we did the programme from a studio, I always tried to imagine myself singing and talking from my own home,\" said the singer. \"Addressing myself not to an audience in the conventional sense, but to scattered individuals - an intimate conversation, but to a couple of million people.\"\nEach episode closed with a rendition of We'll Meet Again. \"Keep smiling through / Just like you always do,\" she urged listeners. But not everyone was happy.\nFollowing a series of British military defeats in northern Africa, a small but vocal campaign argued that \"radio crooners\" and \"sloppy sentimental rubbish\" were affecting the forces' morale. \n\"If our Armed Forces really like this sort of thing, it should be the duty of the BBC to hide the fact from the world,\" wrote a typical correspondent to the Daily Telegraph in 1942. Instead, he argued, the troops should be listening to \"something more virile\".\nIn response, the BBC formed a Dance Music Policy Committee, known colloquially as the \"anti-slush\" committee, to review the music it was broadcasting.\n\"We have recently adopted a policy of excluding sickly sentimentality which, particularly when sung by certain vocalists, can become nauseating and not at all in keeping with what we feel to be the need of the public in this country,\" said one ruling from 1942.\nAmong the victims were Bing Crosby's standard I'll Be Home For Christmas, which the committee felt would make troops homesick and despondent. Similarly, The Mills Brothers' Paper Doll was banned as \"we did not think it desirable to broadcast the song's theme of feminine faithlessness\".\nThe star was not swayed by the arguments, writing a column in the Sunday Dispatch saying the forces personnel and their \"wives and sweethearts\" valued the sentiment of her weekly radio show.\n\"During my two series of Sincerely Yours, I received letters from the boys in the forces at the rate of 1,000 a week. By the end, I received 18,000 and they have been coming ever since,\" she wrote.\n\"As I saw it,\" she later reflected, a song like We'll Meet Again \"was reminding the boys of what they were really fighting for, the precious, personal things rather than the ideologies and theories.\"\nAs the \"anti-slush\" debate raged, one of the star's \"middle-aged listeners\" wrote to the Radio Times, voicing his support for Lynn in particular.\n\"The words of her songs may have been so much sentimental twaddle. But she treated them with as much tenderness as though they were precious old folk, as though they meant something, something that she believed in and assumed that her audience believed in too,\" he wrote.\n\"By some magic she contrived to persuade you that neither she nor anybody else had ever sung or heard the songs before, that she had only just discovered their peculiar delights… and was generously passing them on.\"\nSadly, the BBC bowed to pressure and cancelled Lynn's show, but her popularity persisted.\nIn 1943, she starred in a film loosely based on her own life, in which a beautiful young dancer discovers a gift for singing, and  turns her talents to entertaining the British Army in Europe. \nTitled We'll Meet Again, the finale featured a re-recording of the title track, which became the best-known version of the song.\nSoon afterwards, Sincerely Yours was reinstated by the BBC, and Lynn continued to travel the world, performing to \"the boys\" in uniform.\nBut while the bittersweet lyrics of We'll Meet Again were perfectly suited to the uncertainty of war, the song endured and adapted after 1945.\nIt has been covered by Frank Sinatra, Peggy Lee, Rod Stewart and Sammy Davis Jr. It was referenced by Pink Floyd in their song Vera, and used to haunting effect in the closing scenes of Stanley Kubrick's apocalyptic satire Dr Strangelove.\nDuring the Cold War, it was chosen by the BBC's Wartime Broadcasting Service as one of the tracks that would be played to comfort and reassure survivors of a nuclear Armageddon. \nMore recently, it has featured in TV shows like Stranger Things and The Simpsons, and films including Hellboy and Trainspotting 2; while it also provides an eerie backdrop to the Tower of Terror ride at Walt Disney World in Florida and Disneyland Paris.\nAs the coronavirus hit the UK earlier this year, the song's message of cheerful resilience was invoked by the Queen who, in a rare televised address, told the nation: \"We will be with our friends again. We will be with our families again. We will meet again.\"\nHer message helped the song enter the singles chart for the first time in its 81-year history (the original recording pre-dated the charts, although Charles and Parker's sheet music was a best-seller in the 1940s).\nIn all that time, Dame Vera said she \"never tired of singing\" it.\n\"I had no idea that that particular song would become the tune people most associated with the war era,\" she wrote in her autobiography. \"Or that my voice would become the one that most reminded people of the hope for the future that we needed to have at that time.\n\"I'm told that schoolchildren today still learn the words to We'll Meet Again. That thrills me.\"\nFollow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts. If you have a story suggestion email entertainment.news@bbc.co.uk.",

        "title": "How a $0-budget movie ‘topped the US box office’",
        "description": "In normal times, blockbuster movies usually dominate the box office charts.\nThe big-budget productions, directed by the likes of James Cameron, Steven Spielberg and Ridley Scott, regularly draw the biggest crowds at cinemas across the US and beyond.\nBut on 10 June, one box office-topping movie was watched by just two people, in one cinema.\nUnsubscribe, a 29-minute horror movie shot entirely on video-conferencing app Zoom, generated $25,488 (£20,510) in ticket sales on that day.\nNationwide, the movie hit the top of the charts, according to reputable revenue tacker Box Office Mojo.\nThe budget of the movie: a flat $0. How was that possible?\nThe movie was the brainchild of Eric Tabach, an actor and YouTuber from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and filmmaker Christian Nilsson, from New York City.\nWhen the coronavirus pandemic shuttered movie theatres in March, the pair saw an opportunity in the crisis.\nGiven no big films were being released in cinemas, they wondered if they could hit the top of the charts if they made their own movie, DIY style.\n\"I noticed that the box office figures were absurd; $9,000, $15,000 for each movie. Nothing big was coming out. Blockbuster films were on hold. I wanted to find a way to get the biggest number,\" Mr Tabach told the BBC.\nA cunning plan, befitting of the silver screen itself, was devised.\nTo reach the top of the box office, Mr Tabach and Mr Nilsson realised they had to game the system. They did so by exploiting a loophole in cinema ticket sales, known as four-walling.\n\"Four-walling is when distributors rent out a movie theatre and buy all the seats,\" Mr Tabach, who used to work at BuzzFeed making viral videos, explained.\n\"So they pay a flat fee to the theatre, and any money they make off seats goes straight into their pockets. The moment we realised that was an option of distribution, we went for it.\" \nWith Hollywood essentially mothballed during the pandemic, Mr Tabach and Mr Nilsson knew their movie had a solid chance of raking in the biggest one-day revenue total.\nWith little more than a concept and a can-do attitude, the pair set to work on making the movie. \nMr Nilsson wrote the script in one day. The movie is about five YouTubers who join an online video-call and find themselves haunted and hunted by a mysterious internet troll. \nMr Tabach enlisted the help of his friends to star in the movie. To his surprise, he managed to sign up some prestigious actors.\nThe movie's protagonist, the killer, was played by Charlie Tahan, best known as Wyatt Langmore in Netflix series Ozark. The co-star, Michelle Khare, has been cast in a soon-to-be-released series on HBO Max.\nTwo well-known YouTubers, Yes Theory's Thomas Brag and Zach Kornfeld, part of comedy group The Try Guys, also featured in the film.\n\"They were really excited to be a part of something,\" said Mr Tabach, who himself appeared in the film. \n\"It was at a point in the quarantine when everyone was really bored. Absolutely nothing was going on. Everyone wanted to be a part of this fun project, for free.\" \nThey shot the movie over five days in May, only using Zoom to capture footage. Mr Nilsson then edited the footage and asked a friend to compose a score. Within weeks, it was cinema-ready. \nThey decided to screen the movie at an independent theatre in Westhampton Beach, outside New York City, where Mr Nilsson used to work. To rent the theatre, they were required to pay a small fee. \nIn that sense, \"we made a slight loss\" on the movie, Mr Tabach said. \nOn the night of the screening, the pair went to town, as pictures posted to Facebook show. \nDressed in tuxedos, with their hair neatly swept back, Mr Tabach and Mr Nilsson stood proudly outside the theatre. Above their heads, the theatre's hoarding bore the title of their movie. Unsubscribe, it read, above the words \"sold out\".\nThey had bought every ticket, of course, but it did not matter.\n\"We showed up, got some popcorn, sat down and played it. I've never seen an empty movie theatre, not least one playing a film I was in and made. It was a really cool experience. I watched every screening, over and over again,\" Mr Tabach said.\nMr Tabach watched the movie five times in total, lapping up every minute of it. \nOnce the revenue results were in, the next task was to convince IMDb, the owner of Box Office Mojo, their movie was legitimate.\n\"They kept rejecting us, saying there was no proof,\" Mr Tabach said. \"So we sent them pictures of the actors, but they kept on doubting the entire thing. When media outlets started reporting about the film, it was eventually approved.\n\"Now it's officially number one on IMDb, which is crazy. It was number one for 10 June.\"\nThe movie in second place, The Wretched, was screened in 99 cinemas, earning $22,566 in revenue.\nUnsubscribe may only prove to be a one-off hit, an obscure trivia question on a pub quiz, perhaps. \nBut Mr Tabach said the film, which can be viewed on streaming platform Vimeo, represents more than a box-office ruse. \n\"No matter what, you can always find creative ways to get something done. Even in difficult circumstances. It was cool to see all these people stuck at home come together and make a project,\" he said.  ",

        "title": "South Asian people most likely to die in hospital",
        "description": "South Asian people are the most likely to die from coronavirus after being admitted to hospital in Great Britain, major analysis shows. \nIt is the only ethnic group to have a raised risk of death in hospital and is partly due to high levels of diabetes. \nThe study is hugely significant as it assessed data from four-in-10 of all hospital patients with Covid-19.\nThe researchers said policies such as protecting people at work and who gets a vaccine may now need to change.\nTwenty-seven institutions across the UK,  including universities and public health bodies, as well as 260 hospitals, were involved in the study.\nThe findings have been made public online ahead of being formally published in a medical journal. \nHowever, the results were passed onto the UK government's scientific advisory group - Sage - more than a month ago.\nThe study tells us only what happens once somebody is admitted to hospital, not whether they were more likely to catch the virus.\nIt looked at nearly 35,000 Covid-19 patients in 260 hospitals across England, Scotland and Wales up until the middle of May.\n\"South Asians are definitely more likely to die from Covid-19 in hospital, but we don't see a strong effect in the black group,\" Prof Ewen Harrison, from the University of Edinburgh, told the BBC. \nPeople from South Asian backgrounds were 20% more likely to die than white people. Other minority ethnic groups did not have a higher death rate. \nThe study, the largest of its type in the world, shows:\nThe study also reveals profound differences in who is needing hospital care based on ethnicity. \n\"The South Asian population in hospital looks completely different to the white population,\" Prof Harrison said.\nHe added: \"They're 12 years younger on average, that's a massive difference, and they tend not to have dementia, obesity or lung disease, but very high levels of diabetes.\" \nAround 40% of South Asian patients had either type 1 or type 2 diabetes compared with 25% of white groups.\nDiabetes has a dual effect of increasing the risk of infection and damaging the body's organs, which may affect the ability to survive a coronavirus infection. \nThis is thought to be a major factor in increasing the death rate in people of South Asian ethnicity, but the full picture has not yet been uncovered.\nOther explanations could include poverty or subtle genetic differences that increase the risk of serious infection, the researchers say.\nThe report says ethnicity may now need to be considered alongside age and other health issues when deciding who gets a vaccine if one becomes available. The same issue crops up in deciding who should be shielding and whether some people need extra protection in the workplace. \n\"It does have far-reaching implications that are difficult to grapple with,\" Prof Harrison told the BBC.\n\"Should there be a different policy for a frontline South Asian nurse to a white nurse - that's what's really tricky.\"\nThe study showed all ethnic minorities were more likely to need intensive care than people from white backgrounds. \nThis may be partly due to the disease becoming more severe. However, another factor is white people were older and sicker so ventilation in intensive care may not be an option. \nThe differences, however, were not about access to healthcare.\nThe report showed that all ethnicities arrived in hospital in roughly the same stage of Covid-19 suggesting there is no delay in getting help between ethnicities.\nEarlier work by Public Health England showed people of Bangladeshi heritage were dying at twice the rate of white people, while other black, Asian and minority ethnic groups had between 10% and 50% higher risk of death. Although that did not account for other factors such as occupation, health problems and obesity.\nMeanwhile, work by Queen Mary University of London has suggested heart disease and vitamin D levels do not explain the increased risk of coronavirus in black, Asian and minority ethnic people. \nBoth had been suggested as potential explanations for the greater risk in some groups.\nThe researchers used data from the UK Biobank study. It is following people throughout their lives, including during the pandemic, and has detailed personal and medical information on people taking part.\nIt did not look at deaths, rather who was testing positive for the virus in hospital. \nTheir study, published in the Journal of Public Health, showed weight, poverty and crowded homes all contributed to a higher chance of having the virus. \nResearchers Dr Zahra Raisi-Estabragh and Prof Steffen Petersen told the BBC: \"Although some of the factors we studied appeared important, none of them adequately explained the ethnicity differences.\" \nEven after taking them into account, people from ethnic minorities were still 59% more likely to test positive than those from white backgrounds and the reason remains unknown.\nDr Raisi-Estabragh and Prof Petersen added: \"This is a really important question and one that we need to address urgently. \n\"There are a wide range of possible explanations including sociological, economic, occupational and other biological factors such as different genetic susceptibilities that need to be considered.\" \nFollow James on Twitter",

        "title": "Life-saving coronavirus drug 'major breakthrough'",
        "description": "A cheap and widely available drug can help save the lives of patients seriously ill with coronavirus.\nThe low-dose steroid treatment dexamethasone is a major breakthrough in the fight against the deadly virus, UK experts say. \nThe drug is part of the world's biggest trial testing existing treatments to see if they also work for coronavirus. \nIt cut the risk of death by a third for patients on ventilators. For those on oxygen, it cut deaths by a fifth.\nHad the drug had been used to treat patients in the UK from the start of the pandemic, up to 5,000 lives could have been saved, researchers say.\nAnd it could be of huge benefit in poorer countries with high numbers of Covid-19 patients.\nThe UK government has 200,000 courses of the drug in its stockpile and says the NHS will make dexamethasone available to patients.\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson said there was a genuine case to celebrate \"a remarkable British scientific achievement\", adding: \"We have taken steps to ensure we have enough supplies, even in the event of a second peak.\"\nChief Medical Officer for England Prof Chris Whitty said it would save lives around the world.\nAbout 19 out of 20 patients with coronavirus recover without being admitted to hospital. \nOf those who are admitted, most also recover but some may need oxygen or mechanical ventilation. \nAnd these are the high-risk patients dexamethasone appears to help. \nThe drug is already used to reduce inflammation in a range of other conditions, including arthritis, asthma and some skin conditions.\nAnd it appears to help stop some of the damage that can happen when the body's immune system goes into overdrive as it tries to fight off coronavirus. \nThis over-reaction, a cytokine storm, can be deadly. \nIn the trial, led by a team from Oxford University, about 2,000 hospital patients were given dexamethasone and compared with more than 4,000 who were not. \nFor patients on ventilators, it cut the risk of death from 40% to 28%. \nFor patients needing oxygen, it cut the risk of death from 25% to 20%.\nChief investigator Prof Peter Horby said: \"This is the only drug so far that has been shown to reduce mortality - and it reduces it significantly. It's a major breakthrough.\"\nLead researcher Prof Martin Landray said the findings suggested one life could be saved for:\n\"There is a clear, clear benefit,\" he said.\n\"The treatment is up to 10 days of dexamethasone and it costs about £5 per patient. \n\"So essentially it costs £35 to save a life. \n\"This is a drug that is globally available.\"\nWhen appropriate, hospital patients should now be given it without delay, Prof Landray said.\nBut people should not go out and buy it to take at home. \nDexamethasone does not appear to help people with milder symptoms of coronavirus who do not need help with their breathing. \nThis is the most important trial result for COVID-19 so far. Significiant reduction in mortality in those requiring oxygen or ventilation from a widely available, safe and well known drug. Many thanks to those who took part and made it happen. It will save lives around the world. https://t.co/zRIaHulHOe\nEnd of Twitter post  by @CMO_England\nThe Recovery Trial, running since March, also looked at the malaria drug hydroxychloroquine, which has subsequently been ditched amid concerns it increases fatalities and heart problems. \nThe antiviral drug remdesivir, meanwhile, which appears to shorten recovery time for people with coronavirus, is already being made available on the NHS. \nThe first drug proven to cut deaths from Covid-19 is not some new, expensive medicine but an old, cheap-as-chips steroid.  \nThat is something to celebrate because it means patients across the world could benefit immediately. \nAnd that is why the top-line results of this trial have been rushed out - because the implications are so huge globally. \nDexamethasone has been used since the early 1960s to treat a wide range of conditions, such as rheumatoid arthritis and asthma.\nHalf of all Covid patients who require a ventilator do not survive, so cutting that risk by a third would have a huge impact.  \nThe drug is given intravenously in intensive care and in tablet form for less seriously ill patients. \nSo far, the only other drug proven to benefit Covid patients is remdesivir, which has been used for Ebola.  \nThat has been shown to reduce the duration of coronavirus symptoms from 15 days to 11.\nBut the evidence was not strong enough to show whether it reduced mortality. \nUnlike dexamethasone, remdesivir is a new drug with limited supplies and a price has yet to be announced.

        "description": "Flushing the toilet with the lid up creates a cloud of spray that can be breathed in and may spread infection, such as coronavirus, say researchers.\nChinese scientists calculate that flushing can propel a plume of spray up and out of the toilet bowl, reaching head height and beyond. \nDroplets can travel up to 3ft - or 91cm - from ground level, according to the computer model used by the scientists from Yangzhou University. \nShutting the lid would avoid this.\nThe work is published in the journal Physics of Fluids. \nCoronavirus is spread through airborne droplets from coughs and sneezes, or objects that are contaminated with them. \nPeople who are infected can also have traces of the virus in their faeces, although it is not yet clear whether this might be another way to pass the disease on to others. \nScientists around the world are testing sewage and wastewater to determine how some people might have become infected with coronavirus.\nOther viruses can be spread by poor toilet hygiene, known as faecal-oral transmission. \nAs water pours into the toilet bowl during a flush, it strikes the side, creating turbulence and droplets. The droplets are so small they typically float in the air for more than a minute, according to study author Ji-Xiang Wang and colleagues from Yangzhou University, China. \nDr Bryan Bzdek, from the Bristol Aerosol Research Centre at the University of Bristol, said although there was no clear evidence that coronavirus might spread in this way, it made sense to take precautions.\n\"The study authors suggest that, whenever possible, we should keep the toilet seat down when we flush, clean the toilet seat and any other contact areas frequently, and wash our hands after using the toilet. \n\"While this study is unable to demonstrate that these measures will reduce transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, many other viruses are transmitted though the faecal-oral route, so these are good hygiene practices to have anyway.\"",

        "description": "Scientists are to test whether an experimental drug can prevent potentially deadly blood clots associated with Covid-19.\nThe trial, funded by the British Heart Foundation, will test the theory the clots are caused by a hormone imbalance triggered by coronavirus infection.\nIt will become one of several drugs currently being trialled to prevent the disease's worst effects.  \nA third of hospitalised coronavirus patients develop dangerous blood clots. \nThe drug, TRV027, works to rebalance hormones involved in blood pressure, water and salt. \nScientists from Imperial College London, involved in the trial, think that when the virus enters the body, it uses an enzyme as a \"handle\" to enter the cells. \nBut this disables the enzyme, which plays an important role in balancing the key hormones. When out of balance, the blood can become sticky, leading to clots.\nThey theorise that TRV027 - which won its creator a Nobel Prize in 2012 - can step in to play this rebalancing role.\nMany of the treatments being trialled to treat Covid-19 focus on the body's inflammatory response. \nBut the hormonal imbalance is a \"quite distinct problem\" which may provide clues to the question of why some people get severely ill why others do not, says Dr David Owen, one of the study's leads.\nBlood clotting could also explain why Covid-19 seems to particularly affect people who already have cardiovascular disease despite being a respiratory illness, according to the British Heart Foundation.\nSince Covid-19 is such a complex disease which effects many of the body's systems, this treatment could be used in combination with other drugs says Dr Kat Pollock, a joint lead on the study. \nAbout 60 patients will be given either the new experimental drug, or a placebo, starting next month. \nIt has been shown to be safe in patients with acute heart failure, although it was not effective as a treatment for this condition.  \nTRV027 is just one of several different drugs being trialled to ease the disease's worst effects or help the body fight it off. \nAt least 10 different antiviral drugs including HIV treatment lopinavir/ritonavir are being, or have been trialled to see if they can help fight off the disease.\nNone has yet been shown to be effective on its own, although there is still hope several could be used together to shorten patients' illnesses. \nRemdesivir, a drug that has shown promising effects, works by attacking an enzyme that a virus needs in order to replicate inside body cells.\nMeanwhile plasma - the liquid part of blood - taken from people who have recovered from coronavirus might also help, by giving sick people who haven't recovered the right antibodies to fight it off. \nAnd a number of other treatments are focusing on the body's dangerous inflammatory response to fighting Covid-19, known as cytokine release syndrome. \nFollow Rachel on Twitter",

        "title": "France lifts curbs for 'summer unlike any other'",
        "description": "French President Emmanuel Macron has announced a number of coronavirus restrictions are being lifted.\nCafes and restaurants are reopening across France and travel to other European countries will be allowed.\nPeople will also be able to visit family members in retirement homes, which have been hit particularly hard by the Covid-19 outbreak.\nGermany, Belgium, Croatia and Switzerland are fully reopening borders with EU countries on Monday.\nTravellers from the UK will be able to visit these four countries without quarantine or restrictions upon arrival, though they still face mandatory quarantine on return to the UK. \nMeanwhile, UK and Spanish travellers to France are being asked to go into two-week voluntary quarantine upon arrival there.\nMore than 29,400 people have died of coronavirus in France, and the country has had almost 194,000 confirmed cases - although the number of new cases has slowed markedly in recent days.\nPresident Macron first imposed a strict lockdown on 17 March. These remained in place until 11 May, when the country began to cautiously ease restrictions.\nIn a televised address on  Sunday, Mr Macron said France had won its \"first victory\" but he warned the virus could return.\n\"As soon as tomorrow, we will be able to turn the page on this first chapter across all our territory,\" he said.\nRestaurants, hotels and cafés were allowed to reopen in many parts of France earlier this month - provided distancing rules were observed.\nMr Macron confirmed that from Monday, this would also happen in the Paris region, which recorded the highest number of cases in the country.\nHe also said that schools would reopen from 22 June - except for high schools.\nHowever, the president added, \"this does not mean that the virus has gone and that we can completely drop our guard. The summer of 2020 will be a summer unlike any other and we will need to watch the evolution of the epidemic to be prepared in case it comes back with renewed strength.\"\nMr Macron also confirmed that the second round of municipal elections, originally scheduled for March, would go ahead on 28 June.\nBut, he added, mass gatherings would need to remain \"tightly controlled\" because they were \"the main occasions for spreading the virus\".\nAll of mainland France will now be in the \"green zone\" virus alert level while the overseas territories of Mayotte and French Guiana will remain at the \"orange\" alert level. Both territories still have high numbers of cases, which are threatening to overwhelm their hospital systems.\nPresident Macron is looking ahead to his last two years in office and the elections which are due in May 2022.  Decisions taken now - in the fall-out from Covid-19 - will determine whether he can win another term.\nSo far polls suggest that, unlike many of his fellow European leaders, he has reaped no real advantage from being the man in charge. Well may he celebrate France's \"first victory\" over the virus, the fact remains that a good two-thirds of the French regard him with irritation, if not frank loathing. \nBut for want (still) of an obvious rival from the mainstream left or right, Macron calculates there is everything to play for in 2022. And to win, he needs to develop a new identity - both political and personal.  \nSo in politics, after three years of celebrating global liberalism, the buzz-words will now be sovereign and environmental - bringing it back home and making it green. And on the personal, it will be about \"reinventing himself\" (Macron's words yesterday) and cutting out the  Olympian pretension.  \nWhether France's Joe Publique is interested in buying this presidential re-boot, we shall have to wait to see. \nThe European Commission encouraged the lifting of all internal border restrictions from Monday but only a small number of nations announced they would reopen. \nIn Germany, Belgium, Croatia and Switzerland, which is not an EU member but is part of the Schengen free travel area, traffic police and officials enforcing the coronavirus restrictions are no longer present.\nThe Czech Republic is allowing unrestricted travel to and from 26 states but is still banning people from Belgium, Portugal, Sweden and the UK. \nGreece has opened its borders and is allowing travellers from farther afield such as Australia, New Zealand, Japan and South Korea to enter. \nItaly already reopened its borders on 3 June as did Poland, which opened to EU travellers on 13 June. \nSpain's Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez said the country would allow free travel with EU countries from 21 June, except for Portugal. However, Spain is allowing German tourists to visit its Balearic Islands from Monday as part of a pilot scheme to boost its tourism sector. \nIts border with Portugal remains closed until 1 July. \nAustria will lift its restrictions on 16 June, but a ban on travellers from Portugal, Spain, Sweden and the UK remains in place. \nSweden and Luxembourg never closed their borders.

        "title": "South Asian people most likely to die in hospital",
        "description": "South Asian people are the most likely to die from coronavirus after being admitted to hospital in Great Britain, major analysis shows. \nIt is the only ethnic group to have a raised risk of death in hospital and is partly due to high levels of diabetes. \nThe study is hugely significant as it assessed data from four-in-10 of all hospital patients with Covid-19.\nThe researchers said policies such as protecting people at work and who gets a vaccine may now need to change.\nTwenty-seven institutions across the UK,  including universities and public health bodies, as well as 260 hospitals, were involved in the study.\nThe findings have been made public online ahead of being formally published in a medical journal. \nHowever, the results were passed onto the UK government's scientific advisory group - Sage - more than a month ago.\nThe study tells us only what happens once somebody is admitted to hospital, not whether they were more likely to catch the virus.\nIt looked at nearly 35,000 Covid-19 patients in 260 hospitals across England, Scotland and Wales up until the middle of May.\n\"South Asians are definitely more likely to die from Covid-19 in hospital, but we don't see a strong effect in the black group,\" Prof Ewen Harrison, from the University of Edinburgh, told the BBC. \nPeople from South Asian backgrounds were 20% more likely to die than white people. Other minority ethnic groups did not have a higher death rate. \nThe study, the largest of its type in the world, shows:\nThe study also reveals profound differences in who is needing hospital care based on ethnicity. \n\"The South Asian population in hospital looks completely different to the white population,\" Prof Harrison said.\nHe added: \"They're 12 years younger on average, that's a massive difference, and they tend not to have dementia, obesity or lung disease, but very high levels of diabetes.\" \nAround 40% of South Asian patients had either type 1 or type 2 diabetes compared with 25% of white groups.\nDiabetes has a dual effect of increasing the risk of infection and damaging the body's organs, which may affect the ability to survive a coronavirus infection. \nThis is thought to be a major factor in increasing the death rate in people of South Asian ethnicity, but the full picture has not yet been uncovered.\nOther explanations could include poverty or subtle genetic differences that increase the risk of serious infection, the researchers say.\nThe report says ethnicity may now need to be considered alongside age and other health issues when deciding who gets a vaccine if one becomes available. The same issue crops up in deciding who should be shielding and whether some people need extra protection in the workplace. \n\"It does have far-reaching implications that are difficult to grapple with,\" Prof Harrison told the BBC.\n\"Should there be a different policy for a frontline South Asian nurse to a white nurse - that's what's really tricky.\"\nThe study showed all ethnic minorities were more likely to need intensive care than people from white backgrounds. \nThis may be partly due to the disease becoming more severe. However, another factor is white people were older and sicker so ventilation in intensive care may not be an option. \nThe differences, however, were not about access to healthcare.\nThe report showed that all ethnicities arrived in hospital in roughly the same stage of Covid-19 suggesting there is no delay in getting help between ethnicities.\nEarlier work by Public Health England showed people of Bangladeshi heritage were dying at twice the rate of white people, while other black, Asian and minority ethnic groups had between 10% and 50% higher risk of death. Although that did not account for other factors such as occupation, health problems and obesity.\nMeanwhile, work by Queen Mary University of London has suggested heart disease and vitamin D levels do not explain the increased risk of coronavirus in black, Asian and minority ethnic people. \nBoth had been suggested as potential explanations for the greater risk in some groups.\nThe researchers used data from the UK Biobank study. It is following people throughout their lives, including during the pandemic, and has detailed personal and medical information on people taking part.\nIt did not look at deaths, rather who was testing positive for the virus in hospital. \nTheir study, published in the Journal of Public Health, showed weight, poverty and crowded homes all contributed to a higher chance of having the virus. \nResearchers Dr Zahra Raisi-Estabragh and Prof Steffen Petersen told the BBC: \"Although some of the factors we studied appeared important, none of them adequately explained the ethnicity differences.\" \nEven after taking them into account, people from ethnic minorities were still 59% more likely to test positive than those from white backgrounds and the reason remains unknown.\nDr Raisi-Estabragh and Prof Petersen added: \"This is a really important question and one that we need to address urgently. \n\"There are a wide range of possible explanations including sociological, economic, occupational and other biological factors such as different genetic susceptibilities that need to be considered.\" \nFollow James on Twitter",

        "title": "Life-saving coronavirus drug 'major breakthrough'",
        "description": "A cheap and widely available drug can help save the lives of patients seriously ill with coronavirus.\nThe low-dose steroid treatment dexamethasone is a major breakthrough in the fight against the deadly virus, UK experts say. \nThe drug is part of the world's biggest trial testing existing treatments to see if they also work for coronavirus. \nIt cut the risk of death by a third for patients on ventilators. For those on oxygen, it cut deaths by a fifth.\nHad the drug had been used to treat patients in the UK from the start of the pandemic, up to 5,000 lives could have been saved, researchers say.\nAnd it could be of huge benefit in poorer countries with high numbers of Covid-19 patients.\nThe UK government has 200,000 courses of the drug in its stockpile and says the NHS will make dexamethasone available to patients.\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson said there was a genuine case to celebrate \"a remarkable British scientific achievement\", adding: \"We have taken steps to ensure we have enough supplies, even in the event of a second peak.\"\nChief Medical Officer for England Prof Chris Whitty said it would save lives around the world.\nAbout 19 out of 20 patients with coronavirus recover without being admitted to hospital. \nOf those who are admitted, most also recover but some may need oxygen or mechanical ventilation. \nAnd these are the high-risk patients dexamethasone appears to help. \nThe drug is already used to reduce inflammation in a range of other conditions, including arthritis, asthma and some skin conditions.\nAnd it appears to help stop some of the damage that can happen when the body's immune system goes into overdrive as it tries to fight off coronavirus. \nThis over-reaction, a cytokine storm, can be deadly. \nIn the trial, led by a team from Oxford University, about 2,000 hospital patients were given dexamethasone and compared with more than 4,000 who were not. \nFor patients on ventilators, it cut the risk of death from 40% to 28%. \nFor patients needing oxygen, it cut the risk of death from 25% to 20%.\nChief investigator Prof Peter Horby said: \"This is the only drug so far that has been shown to reduce mortality - and it reduces it significantly. It's a major breakthrough.\"\nLead researcher Prof Martin Landray said the findings suggested one life could be saved for:\n\"There is a clear, clear benefit,\" he said.\n\"The treatment is up to 10 days of dexamethasone and it costs about £5 per patient. \n\"So essentially it costs £35 to save a life. \n\"This is a drug that is globally available.\"\nWhen appropriate, hospital patients should now be given it without delay, Prof Landray said.\nBut people should not go out and buy it to take at home. \nDexamethasone does not appear to help people with milder symptoms of coronavirus who do not need help with their breathing. \nThis is the most important trial result for COVID-19 so far. Significiant reduction in mortality in those requiring oxygen or ventilation from a widely available, safe and well known drug. Many thanks to those who took part and made it happen. It will save lives around the world. https://t.co/zRIaHulHOe\nEnd of Twitter post  by @CMO_England\nThe Recovery Trial, running since March, also looked at the malaria drug hydroxychloroquine, which has subsequently been ditched amid concerns it increases fatalities and heart problems. \nThe antiviral drug remdesivir, meanwhile, which appears to shorten recovery time for people with coronavirus, is already being made available on the NHS. \nThe first drug proven to cut deaths from Covid-19 is not some new, expensive medicine but an old, cheap-as-chips steroid.  \nThat is something to celebrate because it means patients across the world could benefit immediately. \nAnd that is why the top-line results of this trial have been rushed out - because the implications are so huge globally. \nDexamethasone has been used since the early 1960s to treat a wide range of conditions, such as rheumatoid arthritis and asthma.\nHalf of all Covid patients who require a ventilator do not survive, so cutting that risk by a third would have a huge impact.  \nThe drug is given intravenously in intensive care and in tablet form for less seriously ill patients. \nSo far, the only other drug proven to benefit Covid patients is remdesivir, which has been used for Ebola.  \nThat has been shown to reduce the duration of coronavirus symptoms from 15 days to 11.\nBut the evidence was not strong enough to show whether it reduced mortality. \nUnlike dexamethasone, remdesivir is a new drug with limited supplies and a price has yet to be announced.

        "title": "South Asian people most likely to die in hospital",
        "description": "South Asian people are the most likely to die from coronavirus after being admitted to hospital in Great Britain, major analysis shows. \nIt is the only ethnic group to have a raised risk of death in hospital and is partly due to high levels of diabetes. \nThe study is hugely significant as it assessed data from four-in-10 of all hospital patients with Covid-19.\nThe researchers said policies such as protecting people at work and who gets a vaccine may now need to change.\nTwenty-seven institutions across the UK,  including universities and public health bodies, as well as 260 hospitals, were involved in the study.\nThe findings have been made public online ahead of being formally published in a medical journal. \nHowever, the results were passed onto the UK government's scientific advisory group - Sage - more than a month ago.\nThe study tells us only what happens once somebody is admitted to hospital, not whether they were more likely to catch the virus.\nIt looked at nearly 35,000 Covid-19 patients in 260 hospitals across England, Scotland and Wales up until the middle of May.\n\"South Asians are definitely more likely to die from Covid-19 in hospital, but we don't see a strong effect in the black group,\" Prof Ewen Harrison, from the University of Edinburgh, told the BBC. \nPeople from South Asian backgrounds were 20% more likely to die than white people. Other minority ethnic groups did not have a higher death rate. \nThe study, the largest of its type in the world, shows:\nThe study also reveals profound differences in who is needing hospital care based on ethnicity. \n\"The South Asian population in hospital looks completely different to the white population,\" Prof Harrison said.\nHe added: \"They're 12 years younger on average, that's a massive difference, and they tend not to have dementia, obesity or lung disease, but very high levels of diabetes.\" \nAround 40% of South Asian patients had either type 1 or type 2 diabetes compared with 25% of white groups.\nDiabetes has a dual effect of increasing the risk of infection and damaging the body's organs, which may affect the ability to survive a coronavirus infection. \nThis is thought to be a major factor in increasing the death rate in people of South Asian ethnicity, but the full picture has not yet been uncovered.\nOther explanations could include poverty or subtle genetic differences that increase the risk of serious infection, the researchers say.\nThe report says ethnicity may now need to be considered alongside age and other health issues when deciding who gets a vaccine if one becomes available. The same issue crops up in deciding who should be shielding and whether some people need extra protection in the workplace. \n\"It does have far-reaching implications that are difficult to grapple with,\" Prof Harrison told the BBC.\n\"Should there be a different policy for a frontline South Asian nurse to a white nurse - that's what's really tricky.\"\nThe study showed all ethnic minorities were more likely to need intensive care than people from white backgrounds. \nThis may be partly due to the disease becoming more severe. However, another factor is white people were older and sicker so ventilation in intensive care may not be an option. \nThe differences, however, were not about access to healthcare.\nThe report showed that all ethnicities arrived in hospital in roughly the same stage of Covid-19 suggesting there is no delay in getting help between ethnicities.\nEarlier work by Public Health England showed people of Bangladeshi heritage were dying at twice the rate of white people, while other black, Asian and minority ethnic groups had between 10% and 50% higher risk of death. Although that did not account for other factors such as occupation, health problems and obesity.\nMeanwhile, work by Queen Mary University of London has suggested heart disease and vitamin D levels do not explain the increased risk of coronavirus in black, Asian and minority ethnic people. \nBoth had been suggested as potential explanations for the greater risk in some groups.\nThe researchers used data from the UK Biobank study. It is following people throughout their lives, including during the pandemic, and has detailed personal and medical information on people taking part.\nIt did not look at deaths, rather who was testing positive for the virus in hospital. \nTheir study, published in the Journal of Public Health, showed weight, poverty and crowded homes all contributed to a higher chance of having the virus. \nResearchers Dr Zahra Raisi-Estabragh and Prof Steffen Petersen told the BBC: \"Although some of the factors we studied appeared important, none of them adequately explained the ethnicity differences.\" \nEven after taking them into account, people from ethnic minorities were still 59% more likely to test positive than those from white backgrounds and the reason remains unknown.\nDr Raisi-Estabragh and Prof Petersen added: \"This is a really important question and one that we need to address urgently. \n\"There are a wide range of possible explanations including sociological, economic, occupational and other biological factors such as different genetic susceptibilities that need to be considered.\" \nFollow James on Twitter",

        "title": "Life-saving coronavirus drug 'major breakthrough'",
        "description": "A cheap and widely available drug can help save the lives of patients seriously ill with coronavirus.\nThe low-dose steroid treatment dexamethasone is a major breakthrough in the fight against the deadly virus, UK experts say. \nThe drug is part of the world's biggest trial testing existing treatments to see if they also work for coronavirus. \nIt cut the risk of death by a third for patients on ventilators. For those on oxygen, it cut deaths by a fifth.\nHad the drug had been used to treat patients in the UK from the start of the pandemic, up to 5,000 lives could have been saved, researchers say.\nAnd it could be of huge benefit in poorer countries with high numbers of Covid-19 patients.\nThe UK government has 200,000 courses of the drug in its stockpile and says the NHS will make dexamethasone available to patients.\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson said there was a genuine case to celebrate \"a remarkable British scientific achievement\", adding: \"We have taken steps to ensure we have enough supplies, even in the event of a second peak.\"\nChief Medical Officer for England Prof Chris Whitty said it would save lives around the world.\nAbout 19 out of 20 patients with coronavirus recover without being admitted to hospital. \nOf those who are admitted, most also recover but some may need oxygen or mechanical ventilation. \nAnd these are the high-risk patients dexamethasone appears to help. \nThe drug is already used to reduce inflammation in a range of other conditions, including arthritis, asthma and some skin conditions.\nAnd it appears to help stop some of the damage that can happen when the body's immune system goes into overdrive as it tries to fight off coronavirus. \nThis over-reaction, a cytokine storm, can be deadly. \nIn the trial, led by a team from Oxford University, about 2,000 hospital patients were given dexamethasone and compared with more than 4,000 who were not. \nFor patients on ventilators, it cut the risk of death from 40% to 28%. \nFor patients needing oxygen, it cut the risk of death from 25% to 20%.\nChief investigator Prof Peter Horby said: \"This is the only drug so far that has been shown to reduce mortality - and it reduces it significantly. It's a major breakthrough.\"\nLead researcher Prof Martin Landray said the findings suggested one life could be saved for:\n\"There is a clear, clear benefit,\" he said.\n\"The treatment is up to 10 days of dexamethasone and it costs about £5 per patient. \n\"So essentially it costs £35 to save a life. \n\"This is a drug that is globally available.\"\nWhen appropriate, hospital patients should now be given it without delay, Prof Landray said.\nBut people should not go out and buy it to take at home. \nDexamethasone does not appear to help people with milder symptoms of coronavirus who do not need help with their breathing. \nThis is the most important trial result for COVID-19 so far. Significiant reduction in mortality in those requiring oxygen or ventilation from a widely available, safe and well known drug. Many thanks to those who took part and made it happen. It will save lives around the world. https://t.co/zRIaHulHOe\nEnd of Twitter post  by @CMO_England\nThe Recovery Trial, running since March, also looked at the malaria drug hydroxychloroquine, which has subsequently been ditched amid concerns it increases fatalities and heart problems. \nThe antiviral drug remdesivir, meanwhile, which appears to shorten recovery time for people with coronavirus, is already being made available on the NHS. \nThe first drug proven to cut deaths from Covid-19 is not some new, expensive medicine but an old, cheap-as-chips steroid.  \nThat is something to celebrate because it means patients across the world could benefit immediately. \nAnd that is why the top-line results of this trial have been rushed out - because the implications are so huge globally. \nDexamethasone has been used since the early 1960s to treat a wide range of conditions, such as rheumatoid arthritis and asthma.\nHalf of all Covid patients who require a ventilator do not survive, so cutting that risk by a third would have a huge impact.  \nThe drug is given intravenously in intensive care and in tablet form for less seriously ill patients. \nSo far, the only other drug proven to benefit Covid patients is remdesivir, which has been used for Ebola.  \nThat has been shown to reduce the duration of coronavirus symptoms from 15 days to 11.\nBut the evidence was not strong enough to show whether it reduced mortality. \nUnlike dexamethasone, remdesivir is a new drug with limited supplies and a price has yet to be announced.

        "description": "Flushing the toilet with the lid up creates a cloud of spray that can be breathed in and may spread infection, such as coronavirus, say researchers.\nChinese scientists calculate that flushing can propel a plume of spray up and out of the toilet bowl, reaching head height and beyond. \nDroplets can travel up to 3ft - or 91cm - from ground level, according to the computer model used by the scientists from Yangzhou University. \nShutting the lid would avoid this.\nThe work is published in the journal Physics of Fluids. \nCoronavirus is spread through airborne droplets from coughs and sneezes, or objects that are contaminated with them. \nPeople who are infected can also have traces of the virus in their faeces, although it is not yet clear whether this might be another way to pass the disease on to others. \nScientists around the world are testing sewage and wastewater to determine how some people might have become infected with coronavirus.\nOther viruses can be spread by poor toilet hygiene, known as faecal-oral transmission. \nAs water pours into the toilet bowl during a flush, it strikes the side, creating turbulence and droplets. The droplets are so small they typically float in the air for more than a minute, according to study author Ji-Xiang Wang and colleagues from Yangzhou University, China. \nDr Bryan Bzdek, from the Bristol Aerosol Research Centre at the University of Bristol, said although there was no clear evidence that coronavirus might spread in this way, it made sense to take precautions.\n\"The study authors suggest that, whenever possible, we should keep the toilet seat down when we flush, clean the toilet seat and any other contact areas frequently, and wash our hands after using the toilet. \n\"While this study is unable to demonstrate that these measures will reduce transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, many other viruses are transmitted though the faecal-oral route, so these are good hygiene practices to have anyway.\"",

However, Spain is allowing German tourists to visit its Balearic Islands from Monday as part of a pilot scheme to boost its tourism sector. \nIts border with Portugal remains closed until 1 July. \nAustria will lift its restrictions on 16 June, but a ban on travellers from Portugal, Spain, Sweden and the UK remains in place. \nSweden and Luxembourg never closed their borders.

        "title": "What is the true death toll of the coronavirus pandemic?",
        "description": "At least another 130,000 people worldwide have died during the coronavirus pandemic on top of 440,000 officially recorded deaths from the virus, according to BBC research.\nA review of preliminary mortality data from 27 countries shows that in many places the number of overall deaths during the pandemic has been higher than normal, even when accounting for the virus.\nThese so-called \"excess deaths\", the number of deaths above the average, suggest the human impact of the pandemic far exceeds the official figures reported by governments around the world.\nSome will be unrecorded Covid-19 victims, but others may be the result of the strain on healthcare systems and a variety of other factors.\nExplore the animated guide to excess deaths below and scroll further to see how the pandemic has affected countries such as Brazil, Italy, South Africa and the UK.\n14,000\n45,200\nLet's use the UK as an example. If 2020 had been an average year, the dotted line in the chart below shows how many people we would have expected to die each week. This is known as expected deaths and is calculated based on the number of deaths in previous years.\n14,000\n45,200\nAny deaths above those expected are known as excess deaths. During the coronavirus pandemic, many countries have recorded significantly more deaths than expected this year.\n14,000\n45,200\nMany of these excess deaths can be explained by the number of people who were officially confirmed to have had Covid-19. But in many places, that does not account for all the excess deaths.\n14,000\n45,200\nThese other excess deaths may have been, directly or indirectly, caused by the coronavirus pandemic.\n14,000\n45,200\nThe total number of excess deaths shows a more complete picture of the human scale of the coronavirus outbreak.\nDirectly comparing the death toll between different countries is difficult. The accuracy of coronavirus data depends on how many people are tested for the virus and whether governments include deaths outside hospitals in their counts.\nAs the virus has spread around the world, countries have reached different stages of their outbreaks at different times. In some places, the number of excess deaths may still increase in the coming weeks and months, especially as figures are revised, while in others the number of deaths is beginning to return to normal levels.\nAnalysing deaths from all causes during the outbreak and comparing them with deaths in the same period from previous years can begin to provide a more accurate, if still provisional, assessment of the coronavirus pandemic's true death toll.\nRead through our analysis of excess deaths in 27 locations and personal stories highlighting some of the tragic consequences of the pandemic.\nThe number of deaths in the United Kingdom has been 43% higher than average, with about 64,500 more people dying than usual.",

        "title": "What is dexamethasone and how does it fight Covid-19?",
        "description": "An anti-inflammatory drug called dexamethasone has been hailed as a ground-breaking treatment for hospital patients seriously ill with Covid-19.  \nA UK trial showed the drug could save lives - the first internationally to do so - and it can be used in the NHS immediately. \nDexamethasone is a steroid - a medicine that reduces inflammation by mimicking anti-inflammatory hormones produced by the body. \nThis drug works by dampening down the body's immune system.\nCoronavirus infection triggers inflammation as the body tries to fight it off.  \nBut sometimes the immune system goes into overdrive and it's this reaction that can prove fatal - the very reaction designed to attack infection ends up attacking the body's own cells.\nDexamethasone calms this effect. \nIt's only suitable for people who are already in hospital and receiving oxygen or mechanical ventilation - the most unwell.\nThe drug does not work on people with milder symptoms, because suppressing their immune system at this point would not be helpful. \nAccording to the scientists who carried out the trials, one in three deaths could be prevented among patients on ventilators. \nFor patients on oxygen, it could prevent one death in five. \nThere was no significant benefit for patients who were not receiving respiratory support. \nThe results come from the Recovery (Randomised Evaluation of Covid-19 therapy) trial, conducted by the University of Oxford.\nIt's testing whether existing medicines used for other conditions could also be useful in treating Covid-19.\nAbout 2,100 patients received a 6mg daily dose of dexamethasone in the trial for 10 days.\nTheir progress was compared with a random sample of just over 4,300 patients who received no additional treatment.\nScientists hope dexamethasone could eventually be used as part of a suite of drugs which, together, could reduce deaths even further.\nIt is now recommended for adults, not including those who are pregnant or breastfeeding. \nDexamethasone is a low-cost drug which already exists and is in good supply.\nThe UK government says it had already stockpiled enough of the drug to treat 200,000 people, in anticipation of a good result from the trial.\nThe drug costs from £5.40 a day per patient and the treatment on Covid-19 patients lasts for up to 10 days. \nIt was first made in 1957 and became available for use in the UK in the early 1960s. \nBecause it's been around for such a long time, the drug is out of patent. \nThat means lots of different companies can make the drug and it is widely available around the world. \nThe Department of Health and Social Care says the drug has also been added to the government's parallel export list, which bans companies from buying medicines meant for UK patients and selling them on for a higher price in another country. \nThe World Health Organization has welcomed the trial results, saying more therapies are now needed for milder symptoms.\nThe findings are particularly good news for developing countries too.\nIn many African nations, for example, the drug costs less than two dollars.\nIn South Africa, where the drug is manufactured, the government has already been advised to use it to treat patients on oxygen or ventilation support.\nData from the WHO shows that more than 5,000 people have died from Covid-19 in Africa, the majority of whom had underlying health conditions.\nThe drug can help treat various illnesses involving inflammation or swelling in the body, or conditions where the immune system goes into overdrive - for example, severe asthma which can cause inflammation in the airways and lungs, severe allergic reactions or painful, inflamed joints. \nDexamethasone is also useful in autoimmune conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis or lupus, which are caused by the immune system mistakenly attacking the body.\nCommon side effects of dexamethasone used for non-Covid conditions include anxiety, difficulty sleeping, weight gain and fluid retention.\nRarer side effects include eye disorders, blurred vision and haemorrhage.\nHowever, coronavirus patients only need a relatively low dose which should limit side effects. \nThe Chief Medical Officer for England said there were \"no excess harms identified in using this dose of dexamethasone in this patient population\".\nProf Peter Horby, who led the UK research on dexamethasone, said the use of steroids to treat viral respiratory infections, such as Covid-19, has been controversial. \nTrials of the drugs during other disease outbreaks, including Sars - another coronavirus-  were mixed with some showing a benefit, but others not. \n\"It's been a huge ongoing debate,\" says Prof Horby.\nScientists are trialling other steroids, such as methylprednisolone, in coronavirus patients with some promising early results.",

        "title": "Is Iran facing a second wave of coronavirus?",
        "description": "Iran has seen a rapid surge in the numbers of coronavirus cases in recent weeks, sparking fears it might be facing a second wave of the pandemic.\nIran started to relax its restrictions in mid-April, after the number of infections declined, so is it paying the price?\nNew reported infections averaged more than 3,000 a day in the first week of June - a 50% increase on the previous seven days.\nThe figure reached a high of 3,574 on 4 June, before dropping slightly.\nThe previous highest figure was 3,186 on 30 March - during the initial outbreak, when Iran became one of the worst affected countries outside China.\nAt that time, the Iranian authorities were criticised for their hesitation in closing down mosques and key religious sites in the Shia holy city of Qom and for not moving quicker to restrict movement.\nThen, in April, as the number of reported cases dropped to below 1,000 a day, Iran began to ease its restrictions:\nCity transport systems across Iran, as well as banks and offices, have been packed with people.\nThe epidemic was initially concentrated in Qom and the capital, Tehran.\nBut now, a flare-up has been reported in the south-west, notably in Khuzestan province, an oil-rich region that borders Iraq.\nThere is clearly more social interaction with the easing of restrictions - but officials have suggested the surge in new cases could be down to more testing.\nPresident Hassan Rouhani has said this means you will find more cases.\nIran's chief epidemiologist at the country's health ministry, Mohammad-Mehdi Gouya, explained: \"The main reason for the rising numbers is that we have started identifying [infected people] who have no or mild symptoms.\"\nIt currently does one test for every 79 people, which is up from about one test for every 380 two months ago.\nHowever, when you look at the proportion of these tests that are positive, there is a clear upward trend since the middle and end of May after it dropped sharply in April.\nOn 29 May, just under 11% of tests were positive - but by 6 June that figure had risen to over 14%.\nHealth officials have also pointed out the number of daily deaths recorded has been below 100 since mid-April.\nThe daily figure was between 30 and 90 for most of May, but on 14 June it went above 100. This was the first time it had done so in two months.\nIt would take several weeks after the initial rise in infections for an increasing trend in recorded deaths to become apparent.\nAnd a report by the Iranian parliament's research centre, published in April, suggested the real death toll could be twice as high as the official number, which comprises deaths in hospitals only.\nHealth Minister Saeed Namaki said people were ignoring social-distancing rules.\n\"People have become completely careless regarding this disease,\" he told the Iranian news agency.\n\"If our people fail to respect the health protocols... we must prepare ourselves for the worst situation.\"  \nAnd a health ministry poll last week suggested only:\nWhat options do the authorities have?\nPresident Rouhani has warned restrictions may have to be reintroduced if the outbreak worsens.\nBut the leadership in Tehran does not want to talk about a \"second wave\", even though some officials in other parts of Iran have been warning of one, according to BBC Persian's Rana Rahimpour. \nAnd she adds that it cannot afford to continue restrictions, because of the state of the economy, which faces multiple challenges such as US sanctions, corruption and mismanagement.\n\"To contain the virus, you need a lockdown,\" says Rana Rahimpour, \"and in a lockdown, you need to be able to pay people.\"\nRead more from Reality Check\nSend us your questions\nFollow us on Twitter",

        "title": "Is it safe to relax the 2m rule?",
        "description": " A review into the 2m (6ft) social distancing rule has been commissioned by UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson.\nHe faces increasing pressure from his own MPs and the hospitality industry to allow people to be closer together, to help businesses after they reopen.\nHowever, the government's scientific advisers say that being 1m (just over 3ft) apart carries up to 10 times the risk of being 2m apart. \nThe simple answer is that the nearer you are to someone who is infected, the greater the risk of catching the virus.\nThe World Health Organization recommends keeping a distance of at least 1m. \nSome countries have adopted this guidance, often because they also insist on people wearing masks. \nOthers, including the UK, have gone further:\nIn a study published in medical journal The Lancet, scientists looked at research into how coronavirus spreads.\nThey concluded that keeping at least 1m from other people could be the best way to limit the chances of infection.\nThe risk of being infected is estimated to be 13% within 1m, but only 3% beyond that distance.\nAnd the study says that for every extra metre of distance up to 3m, the risk is further reduced by half. \nIt can be traced back to research in the 1930s.\nScientists found that droplets of liquid released by coughs or sneezes evaporate quickly in the air or fall to the ground. \nMost of those droplets, they reckoned, would land within 1-2m.\nThat is why it is said the greatest risks come from having the virus coughed at you from close range, or from touching a surface that someone coughed onto, and then touching your face.\nProximity and surface contact are considered the main transmission routes.\nBut some researchers fear coronavirus can also be transported through the air in tiny particles called aerosols. \nIf true, then the flow of wind from someone's breath could carry the virus over longer distances. \nProf Lydia Bourouiba from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) used high-speed cameras to capture a cough projecting miniature specks as far as 6m.\nAnd a study carried out in Chinese hospitals which found traces of coronavirus in Covid-19 wards and intensive care units, estimated that 4m was a better safe distance.\nBut the US Centers for Disease Control says the role of aerosols in spreading the virus is \"currently uncertain\".\nAnd what's still not known is whether any virus that spreads further than 2m can still be infectious.  \nTiming is also key. The longer you spend in close proximity with an infected person, the bigger the risk.\nScientists advising the UK government say spending six seconds at a distance of 1m from someone is the same as spending one minute at a distance of 2m. \nBeing exposed to someone coughing is riskier. Being 2m away from a cough carries the same risk as someone talking to you for 30 minutes at the same distance.\nA crowded stuffy room is bound to increase the chances of infection. \nThe direction of air flow is also crucial - whether a draught or fan behind someone infected is pushing any virus they breathe out towards you.\nAnd a good supply of fresh air can make all the difference.\nIn a restaurant in China, where nine people caught the virus, the air conditioning units mounted on the walls were blamed for recirculating the air rather than refreshing it.\nJapanese researchers investigated 110 cases of Covid-19 and found the odds of infection were nearly 19 times greater indoors than outside.\nScientists advising the British government say every workplace or building should assess the risks. \nAnd they say where 2m of social distancing is impossible, people should only be closer for short periods of time. \nPlastic screens are suggested along with moving to shift patterns of work to minimise the numbers in at any one time. \nArranging seating so people are not face to face is also judged to help. \nAnd in a growing number of many countries, including all parts of the UK, people are being encouraged to wear face coverings on public transport and \"enclosed spaces where social distancing is not always possible\".\nIt is only a few months since the coronavirus emerged, and in that short time scientists have learned a great deal about it.\nBut we still don't know how much virus can be released by people who are infected and how much someone has to receive to catch the disease. \nUntil that is established, the advice is that the risks are real - and that only when the numbers being infected drop dramatically can the distancing guidance be relaxed.

        "title": "Fergus Walsh: The mystery of early 'Covid' cases",
        "description": "My experience of testing positive for coronavirus antibodies clearly struck a nerve. Two weeks ago I wrote that I'd had no recent symptoms but dismissed a bout of pneumonia in January because it was weeks before the first confirmed cases of Covid-19 in the UK.\nMany of you responded with your own experiences of having Covid-like symptoms - some as far back as November - and urged me to investigate further.  \nBut is it possible to prove when coronavirus first struck in the UK, and does it matter?\nFirst, a reminder of the timeline.\nChina reported a cluster of cases on 31 December 2019, but later told the WHO that the earliest symptoms from these patients dated back to 8 December.\nBut according to unreleased government data obtained by the South China Morning Post (which, I should stress, has not been seen by the BBC) the first case in Wuhan could have been on 17 November, with several further cases that month.\nNo individual has yet been identified as \"patient zero\", the first person to get infected with the new virus.\nThe first confirmed cases in the UK were identified on 31 January, when two Chinese nationals tested positive in York. \nThey caught the virus abroad. The first confirmed case of transmission inside the UK was registered in Surrey on 28 February.\nBut plenty of people are doubting the official timeline.\nThe author Catherine Mayer believes it's possible her late husband Andy Gill - guitarist and co-founder of Gang of Four - may have been one of the earliest to be struck down by Covid-19.\nShe spoke movingly about his death on the Coronavirus Newscast last month.\nAndy returned from a tour in China on 23 November 2019 and fell ill in December with many symptoms of Covid-19. He died in St Thomas's hospital on 1 February. Doctors did consider whether it might be this new virus they were hearing about, but the timelines didn't seem plausible.\nThen a story broke that suggested coronavirus had already been in Europe in December. A hospital near Paris retested old samples from a pneumonia patient which tested positive for coronavirus. \nCatherine wrote to Andy's specialist, who agreed it might have been coronavirus - but how to prove it? She began doing her own detective work and discovered that his tour manager had fallen seriously ill with a respiratory infection too. And, sadly, Catherine's stepfather also died, on 22 December. \"It raises all sorts of questions for me on a personal level,\" she says.  \n\"The key question is, could this have been the coronavirus Covid-19?\" asks Prof Tom Solomon, director of the UK Emerging Infections Research Unit at the University of Liverpool. \"I think the simple answer is yes, it could have been. We now know the virus was around longer - new viruses are always around before you spot them.\"\nAs the BBC's medical correspondent, since 2004 I have reported on global disease threats such as bird flu, swine flu, Sars and Mers - both coronaviruses - and Ebola. You could say I've been waiting much of my career for a global pandemic. And yet when Covid-19 came along, the world was not as ready as it could have been. Now it's here I wish, like everyone else, it would go away. Sadly, we may have to live with coronavirus indefinitely. In this column I will be reflecting on that new reality. \nRead last week's column:  Why do healthy people volunteer to be vaccine guinea pigs?\nAnd many of you have been doing your own investigations. Debra Scott from Blackpool thinks she caught the virus in late November at her husband's school reunion, where there was \"lots of hugging and handshaking\".  \nHer symptoms included a \"cough that could kill a horse\" and lasted for weeks. \"I kept thinking I was getting better then - boom - it floored me again and again,\" she says. \nShe was so convinced it was Covid that she sent a blood sample off to a lab for an antibody test, which came back positive. She hopes it will give her some immunity, because she's diabetic. \"Before I had the test I was panicking, I didn't want to end up on a ventilator,\" says Debra. \nTricia Camm from Whitby was ill at the end of January, while on holiday in the Scottish lochs. She now thinks it was coronavirus because she lost her sense of taste and kept sending meals back in restaurants. \"I was so disappointed, I love the food there,\" she says. \nBut others are more sceptical. David Brown, a retired molecular virologist worked on coronaviruses for 20 years.\nHis wife got pneumonia over Christmas, with an appalling cough and loss of taste and smell.  \nHe thinks she and many others probably had another coronavirus, OC43, which can also cause respiratory illnesses. \n\"OC43 can be really severe. It can cause recurring infections in your lifetime like other coronaviruses. There's no surveillance of it, and it's impossible to go back and check,\" he says.\nPublic Health England has been doing surveillance of the prevalence of Covid-19.\nThis includes analysing samples from blood donors across England, which are tested for the presence of coronavirus antibodies. \nIt found the antibodies were present in 1.5% of donor samples in London in the week of 23 March.\nGiven that it takes at least two weeks for antibodies to show up, that means those people got infected at least two weeks previously, in early March.  \nThat is only a week or so after the first confirmed human to human transmission in the UK.  Bear in mind that donors are advised to wait a couple of weeks after any sickness before giving blood, so it might have been even earlier - unless they were asymptomatic and never knew they had been infected with a virus.\nFrustratingly, there are no plans to check donations made in February or January, which would give firmer evidence about the origins of Covid-19 in the UK. \nAnother piece of the jigsaw could come as an accidental by-product of a huge research study using low dose chest CT scans to look for the early signs of lung cancer.  \nThe Summit trial scanned 6,500 men and women in Greater London between November 2019 and lockdown on 23 March 2020.\nDr Joseph Jacob, a consultant radiologist at UCLH is planning to use artificial intelligence to analyse the scans to look for tell-tale signs of Covid-19. \nHealthy lungs should look black on a scan because they are mostly air, but with Covid they often have what's known as a \"ground glass\" appearance - like opaque windows in a bathroom.\nThere is an obvious problem here. Other respiratory diseases can also cause this shadowy appearance, and so it may be hard to distinguish between Covid-19 and seasonal flu.\nDr Jacobs told me: \"We won't be able to definitely say whether it's Covid because we won't have blood or tissue samples from the patients. But as you go from January to March the incidence of flu should be decreasing.\"\nBut we've got to be really careful that we don't retrofit general winter respiratory symptoms to match Covid-19.  \nResearchers at the University of Nottingham have begun analysing samples from patients with lung problems going back to January.\nJonathan Ball, professor of molecular virology says: \"The earliest point we can detect the virus is about the third week of February. \n\"One thing that I constantly get told is: 'I must have had Covid in November, December, or January, because my symptoms fit the description.' But that doesn't fit what we've found in samples.\"\nIf coronavirus was present in the UK much earlier than was thought, it would change our understanding of how fast the disease spread and when was the best time to introduce lockdown measures.\nEpidemics start small, but without social distancing cases can double every two to three days.\nIf you mistake the start date of an epidemic, your estimates of how many people are infected at any given point can be wildly inaccurate.\nThis is further complicated by the unknown proportion of people who've had the virus without displaying any symptoms.\nCountries which introduced strict social distancing measures or had effective test and isolate measures early on in their epidemics have tended to emerge from lockdowns or controls with far fewer deaths than others.\nNow that antibody tests are becoming more widely available, it should be possible for NHS staff, and later the public, to check whether they have previously been infected with coronavirus.\nBut it won't tell them when they had the infection. So that hacking cough, high temperature or loss of taste and smell you had early this year really might have been Covid-19.  But then again, unless your swab, blood or tissue samples are sitting in a pathology department somewhere awaiting re-analysis, we will probably never know.  \nFollow @BBCFergusWalsh on Twitter\nA group of amateur singers experienced a viral illness with familiar symptoms long before the first recorded case of coronavirus in the UK.\nThe strange case of the choir that coughed in January",
